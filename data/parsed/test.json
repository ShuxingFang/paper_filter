        "title": "Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification in Mild-to-Moderate Depression: Outcomes and Moderation Effects of Spirituality.",
        "abstract": "Objective: Understanding the relevance of religion or spirituality (R/S) in the treatment of mental disorders is central to clinical and academic psychiatry. In this secondary analysis, associations of R/S with depression were investigated with respect to a new second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, the Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program. Methods: Different aspects of spirituality, spiritual coping, and spiritual engagement were assessed in 81 patients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate depression. Treatment effects on R/S postscores and predictor and moderation effects of-depression-severity and stress change-scores were evaluated at 8 weeks (MBLM vs. CONTROL [drug continuation therapy] vs. TAU [inpatient treatment as usual]) and 6 months (TAU+MBLM vs. TAU). Results: At both time points, significant differences between MBLM versus TAU and CONTROL were found in a range of spiritual outcomes, most of them with a medium-to-large effect size and in favor of MBLM. Baseline interest in spirituality (p?=?0.001) and baseline spiritual mind-body practice (p?=?0.017) were identified as independent predictors of change in-depression-severity at 6 months. Moreover, moderation analyses found that patients reporting often/regular spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months did not benefit differently from TAU+MBLM versus TAU (p?=?0.437) regarding their change in-depression-severity and stress, while those reporting no/seldom spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months benefited significantly worse from TAU than from TAU+MBLM (p?=?0.002). Conclusions: Participation in the MBLM program resulted in significantly greater increases in spirituality in depressed patients than standard therapy. Interest in spirituality and engagement in spiritual mind-body practices at baseline were positive predictors of clinical outcome in both groups. Patients of any group who regularly performed spiritual mind-body practices benefited equally in terms of antidepressant outcomes, underlining the benefit of these practices within a general therapeutic framework.

        "title": "Four-Week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy for Family Dementia Caregivers: A Randomized Controlled Trial with Neural Circuit Changes.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high burden of depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n = 24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression. DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes. RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC. DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological traits. Neuroimaging results suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with an emotion regulation network might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.",

        "title": "Mechanisms of improvement in generalized anxiety disorder: A mediation and moderated mediation analysis from a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with the lowest treatment response rate among all anxiety disorders. Understanding mechanisms of improvement may help to develop more effective and personalized treatments. AIM: The objective of the study was to investigate different improvement mechanisms in the treatment of individuals diagnosed with GAD. DESIGN: We reported data from a randomized controlled trial that evaluated three different GAD treatments (mindfulness-based intervention, BMT; fluoxetine, FLX; and an active comparison group, QoL) for 8?weeks. METHOD: Mediation analyses were performed evaluating the association between worry symptoms at baseline and anxiety scoring at the endpoint, considering self-compassion or mindfulness or its dimensions at mid-treatment as mediators for the whole sample (assessing GAD improvement mechanism) and the different interventions as moderators. RESULTS: Contrary to mindfulness state scoring (C =?.06; 95% CI = -.05 to .20), self-compassion (C =?.11; 95% CI = .01 to .28) and non-judgement of inner experience (C =?.10; 95% CI = .004 to .21) mediated the association between worry symptoms at baseline and anxiety at the endpoint. When comparing BMT to FLX, the intervention modality did not moderate these associations. CONCLUSION: Self-compassion and non-judgement of inner experience seem to be essential targets in GAD treatment, contrary to the mindfulness state itself. Although no difference was found considering the intervention modality, future research may assess how to boost these dimensions in specific treatments for GAD.",

        "title": "Self-compassion training for individuals with social anxiety disorder: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Self-compassion is the ability to offer oneself kindness and compassion in response to failure, suffering, or insecurity. Learning how to be self-compassionate through self-compassion training appears effective for improving psychological well-being in community samples and promising for clinical populations. The current randomized controlled trial was designed to (a) examine the effectiveness of a self-guided self-compassion training program; and (b) determine whether self-compassion training can help mitigate social anxiety disorder (SAD) symptoms. Adults with SAD (n?=?63; Mage?=?34.3, SD?=?11.4; 67.8% female; 84.7% Caucasian) were randomized to a waitlist control condition, a self-guided self-compassion training condition, or a self-guided applied relaxation training condition for six weeks. Outcome measures of SAD symptoms and self-compassion were completed pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, as well as at 3-months follow-up. Multilevel linear modelling results suggested the self-compassion training program was statistically superior at improving outcome measures relative to the waitlist control condition (ps?<?.05; ?(2)(p)s?=?.12-.33), but not relative to the applied relaxation training condition (ps?>?.05; ?(2)(p)s?=?.01-.05). Self-compassion training produced greater clinically significant gains in self-compassion and reductions in fear of self-compassion compared to both the waitlist condition and applied relaxation training. The current trial provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a self-help self-compassion training program and provides evidence that self-compassion training may be beneficial for managing clinically significant SAD symptoms.",

        "title": "A compassion-based treatment for couples with the female partner suffering from current depressive disorder: A randomized-controlled trial",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that depression and interpersonal relationships are interdependently connected and that including the intimate partner in treatment for depression has beneficial effects. Given evidence that compassion is both an interpersonal quality and a promising treatment target, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of a compassion-based, contemplative treatment for couples employing a multi-method approach for evaluation. METHODS: In a pre-post-follow-up design, n = 53 different-sex couples including women with current depression were randomly assigned to a 10-week-long CBCTÂ®-fC (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training/intervention for couples) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Multi-level linear regression models and post-hoc contrasts were calculated to determine changes in depressive symptoms, mindfulness and self-compassion, interpersonal functioning and neuroendocrine markers collected during a partnership appreciation task (PAT) in the laboratory before and after CBCT-fC treatment. RESULTS: While CBCT-fC led to a comparable decrease of depressive symptoms as TAU, the training specifically increased self-compassion and mindfulness versus TAU. Interestingly, interpersonal functioning did not improve, which was also reflected in participants' preferred self-focus in-between-session practices, instead of practices with interpersonal focus. There were no group-specific changes in psychobiological stress-marker reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: CBCT-fC was effective in decreasing current depressive symptomatology and increasing mindfulness, and self-compassion. Especially the motivation to participate, such as improving interpersonal functioning, should be addressed and intrinsic motives of the partners to be involved. In highly burdened individuals, self-regulation may need to be improved before co-regulation can be addressed, which would requiring longer treatments. Facilitating factors for engaging in the practice between-sessions seem meaningful.",

        "title": "The Effectiveness of Mindful Hypnotherapy on Depression, Self-Compassion, and Psychological Inflexibility in Females with Major Depressive Disorder: A Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "The effectiveness of the novel intervention mindful hypnotherapy on depression, self-compassion, and psychological inflexibility in females with major depressive disorder was examined in a randomized, clinical trial. Thirty-four participants were randomly allocated into mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups. The intervention group was treated in 8 face-to-face, 60-minute weekly therapy sessions along with mindful hypnosis audio tapes to be used daily. The results of analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences between the mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups after intervention and at 2-month follow-up (p < .001). The between-subject test of repeated measures ANOVAs also indicated a clinically significant difference between groups across time (baseline, postintervention, and 2-month follow-up) in depression, F = 53.86, p < .001, effect size = .65, and in self-compassion, F = 33.18, p < .001, effect size = .53, as well as psychological inflexibility, F = 26.84, p < .001, effect size = .48. In conclusion, this study indicates that mindful hypnotherapy is an effective intervention for treating depression as well as reducing psychological inflexibility and improving self-compassion for patients with major depressive disorder.",

        "title": "An Integrative Theory-Driven Positive Emotion Regulation Intervention.",
        "abstract": "Over the past fifteen years, positive psychology research has validated a set of happiness enhancing techniques. These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program - PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls. Our results suggest that the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation can be an effective option to organize and deliver positive integrative interventions.

        "title": "Loving-Kindness Meditation to Target Affect in Mood Disorders: A Proof-of-Concept Study.",
        "abstract": "Conventional treatments for mood disorders primarily focus on reducing negative affect, but little on enhancing positive affect. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a traditional meditation practice directly oriented toward enhancing unconditional and positive emotional states of kindness towards oneself and others. We report here two independent and uncontrolled studies carried out at different centers, one in Boston, USA (n = 10), and one in Frankfurt, Germany (n = 8), to examine the potential therapeutic utility of a brief LKM group intervention for symptoms of dysthymia and depression. Results at both centers suggest that LKM was associated with large-sized effects on self-reported symptoms of depression (d = 3.33 and 1.90), negative affect (d = 1.98 and 0.92), and positive affect (d = 1.63 and 0.94). Large effects were also found for clinician-reported changes in depression, rumination and specific positive emotions, and moderate effects for changes in adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The qualitative data analyses provide additional support for the potential clinical utility of the intervention. This proof-of-concept evaluation of LKM as a clinical strategy warrants further investigation.

        "title": "A RCT comparing daily mindfulness meditations, biofeedback exercises, and daily physical exercise on attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying in stressed young adults",
        "abstract": "Our Western society is characterized by multitasking, competition, and constant time pressure. Negative effects of stress for the individual (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and for organizations and society (costs due to work absence) are very high. Thus, time-efficient self-help interventions to address these issues are necessary. This study assessed the effects of daily mindfulness meditations (MM) versus daily heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) and daily physical exercise (PE) on attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying. Young adults (n = 75, age range 18 to 40) with elevated stress levels were randomized to MM, HRV-BF, or PE, and measurements were taken at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. Interventions in all three groups were self-guided and lasted for 5 weeks. Generalized estimating equation analyses showed that overall, all three interventions were effective and did not differ from each other. However, practice time differed between groups, with participants in the PE group practicing much more than participants in the other two groups. Therefore, additional analyses were carried out in two subsamples. The optimal dose sample included only those participants who practiced for at least 70 % of the total prescribed time. In the equal dose sample, home practice intensity was equal for all three groups. Again, the effects of the three interventions did not differ. In conclusion, MM, HRV-BF, and PE are all effective self-help methods to improve attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying, and mindfulness meditation was not found to be more effective than HRV-biofeedback or physical exercise for these cognitive processes.

        "title": "Effects of mindfulness training on body awareness to sexual stimuli implications for female sexual dysfunction",
        "abstract": "Objectives: Treatments of female sexual dysfunction have been largely unsuccessful because they do not address the psychological factors that underlie female sexuality. Negative self-evaluative processes interfere with the ability to attend and register physiological changes (interoceptive awareness). This study explores the effect of mindfulness meditation training on interoceptive awareness and the three categories of known barriers to healthy sexual functioning: attention, self-judgment, and clinical symptoms. Methods: Forty-four college students (30 women) participated in either a 12-week course containing a 'meditation laboratory' or an active control course with similar content or laboratory format. Interoceptive awareness was measured by reaction time in rating physiological response to sexual stimuli. Psychological barriers were assessed with self-reported measures of mindfulness and psychological well-being. Results: Women who participated in the meditation training became significantly faster at registering their physiological responses (interoceptive awareness) to sexual stimuli compared with active controls (F(1,28) = 5.45, p = .03, ?p? = 0.15). Female meditators also improved their scores on attention (t = 4.42, df = 11, p = .001), self-judgment, (t = 3.1, df = 11, p = .01), and symptoms of anxiety (t = ?3.17, df = 11, p = .009) and depression (t = ?2.13, df = 11, p < .05). Improvements in interoceptive awareness were correlated with improvements in the psychological barriers to healthy sexual functioning (r = ?0.44 for attention, r = ?0.42 for self-judgment, and r = 0.49 for anxiety; all p < .05). Conclusions: Mindfulness-based improvements in interoceptive awareness highlight the potential of mindfulness training as a treatment of female sexual dysfunction.
