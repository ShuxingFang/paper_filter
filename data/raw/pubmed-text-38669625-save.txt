TI  - Effects of mind-body exercise on perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 457-467
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000002336 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The increasing attention to the management of perimenopausal and 
      postmenopausal women parallels the growth of the aging population. Although 
      hormone therapy is commonly used to alleviate menopausal symptoms, it carries a 
      potential risk of cancer. Recently, mind-body exercises have emerged as 
      innovative approaches for improving menopausal symptoms and bone health. However, 
      research findings have needed to be more consistent, highlighting the 
      significance of this study's systematic review of mind-body exercise effects on 
      perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate 
      the impact of mind-body exercises, including tai chi, yoga, Pilates, qigong, 
      baduanjin, and mindfulness-based stress reduction, on bone mineral density, sleep 
      quality, anxiety, depression, and fatigue among perimenopausal and postmenopausal 
      women. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Four electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science-were systematically 
      searched from inception until July 2023. The search focused exclusively on 
      randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of mind-body exercise 
      interventions on perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The methodological 
      quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Bias Risk 
      Assessment tool. FINDINGS: A total of 11 randomized controlled trials, comprising 
      1,005 participants, were included in the analysis. Traditional meta-analysis 
      indicated that mind-body exercise significantly enhanced bone mineral density in 
      perimenopausal and postmenopausal women compared with control groups, with a 
      standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.66; P = 0.001, I2 = 
      7%). In addition, significant improvements were observed in sleep quality (SMD, 
      -0.48; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.17; P = 0.002, I2 = 76%), anxiety reduction (SMD, 
      -0.80; 95% CI, -1.23 to -0.38; P = 0.0002, I2 = 84%), depressive mood (SMD, 
      -0.80; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.44; P < 0.0001, I2 = 79%), and fatigue (SMD, -0.67; 
      95% CI, -0.97 to -0.37; P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 
      findings of this meta-analysis demonstrate that mind-body exercise positively 
      influences bone mineral density, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and fatigue 
      among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

TI  - Recovery from recurrent depression with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and 
      antidepressants: a qualitative study with illustrative case studies.
PG  - e033892
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033892 [doi]
LID - e033892
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the recovery journeys of people with a 
      history of recurrent depression who took part in a psychosocial programme 
      designed to teach skills to prevent depressive relapse (mindfulness-based 
      cognitive therapy (MBCT)), alongside maintenance antidepressant medication (ADM). 
      DESIGN: A qualitative study embedded within a multicentre, single blind, 
      randomised controlled trial (the PREVENT trial). SETTING: Primary care urban and 
      rural settings in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 42 people who participated in the MBCT 
      arm of the parent trial were purposively sampled to represent a range of recovery 
      journeys. INTERVENTIONS: MBCT involves eight weekly group sessions, with four 
      refresher sessions offered in the year following the end of the programme. It was 
      adapted to offer bespoke support around ADM tapering and discontinuation. 
      METHODS: Written feedback and structured in-depth interviews were collected in 
      the 2 years after participants undertook MBCT. Data were analysed using thematic 
      analysis and case studies constructed to illustrate the findings. RESULTS: People 
      with recurrent depression have unique recovery journeys that shape and are shaped 
      by their pharmacological and psychological treatment choices. Their journeys 
      typically include several over-arching themes: (1) beliefs about the causes of 
      depression, both biological and psychosocial; (2) personal agency, including 
      expectations about their role in recovery and treatment; (3) acceptance, both of 
      depression itself and the recovery journey; (4) quality of life; (5) experiences 
      and perspectives on ADM and ADM tapering-discontinuation; and (6) the role of 
      general practitioners, both positive and negative. CONCLUSIONS: People with 
      recurrent depression describe unique, complex recovery journeys shaped by their 
      experiences of depression, treatment and interactions with health professionals. 
      Understanding how several themes coalesce for each individual can both support 
      their recovery and treatment choices as well as health professionals in providing 
      more accessible, collaborative, individualised and empowering care. TRIAL

TI  - COPAHS Study: protocol of a randomised experimental study comparing the effects 
      of hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, and spiritual practices on experimental pain 
      in healthy adults.
PG  - e040068
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040068 [doi]
LID - e040068
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing interest in studying the potential 
      benefits of so-called complementary and alternative approaches for pain 
      management, such as hypnosis and mindfulness-based interventions. More recently, 
      researchers have been interested in studying the effects of spiritual practices 
      on pain experience as well. These practices may increase pain tolerance, result 
      in a positive re-appraisal of pain and influence other psychological variables 
      that are known to be associated with pain experience. The purpose of this study 
      is to evaluate and compare the immediate effects of self-hypnosis, mindfulness 
      meditation, and a spiritual intervention relative to a control condition for 
      increasing pain tolerance and reducing pain intensity and pain-related stress, in 
      response to experimental painful stimulation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Recruitment 
      is anticipated to start in November 2020. This is a randomised quantitative 
      experimental mixed-design repeated-measures study with three assessment points: 
      baseline (T0), pre-test (T1) and post-test (T2). Eligible healthy adults will be 
      randomised to one of the four study conditions. Interventions will be a 20-minute 
      audio-guided practice of either self-hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, or 
      Christian prayer. Participants in the control group will not be instructed to use 
      any specific strategy during the painful stimulation. Participants will be 
      submitted to a first cycle of Cold Pressor Arm Wrap. They will then listen to a 
      20-minute audio recording inducing one of the three interventions, or, in the 
      case of the control group, to a 20-minute audio recording of text from a natural 
      history textbook. Primary outcomes are pain intensity and pain tolerance. 
      Pain-related stress as measured by salivary cortisol level and heart rate 
      variability are secondary outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was 
      approved by ISPA-University Institute's internal Ethics Committee for Research on 
      3rd December 2018 (reference I/010/12/2018). Findings will be published in 
      peer-reviewed indexed journals and presented at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION 
      NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov registry (NCT04491630). Stage: pre-results.

TI  - Cognitive-Based Interventions for Improving Psychological Health and Well-Being 
      for Parents of Children with Developmental Disabilities: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.
PG  - 3316-3335
LID - 10.1007/s10803-023-06063-x [doi]
AB  - This review aims to systematically summarize existing evidence to determine the 
      effectiveness of cognitive-based interventions (CBIs) on psychological health and 
      well-being among parents of children with developmental disabilities (DD). Six 
      databases were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      from their inception to April 2023. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for 
      RCTs was applied to assess the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence was 
      evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and 
      Evaluation. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. 
      Twenty-five RCTs involving 1915 participants were identified. The results 
      indicated that CBIs reduced parental stress levels (Hedges' g = - 0.69), 
      depressive symptoms (g = - 0.95), anxiety levels (g = - 0.78), and parental 
      distress (g = - 0.29), and improved parental well-being (g = 0.62) and 
      parent‒child relationships (g = 0.43) postintervention compared with the 
      active/inactive control groups. Subgroup analysis of the effectiveness of 
      interventions using mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioural 
      therapy showed positive effects. The favourable intervention duration and 
      participant targets were also identified in this review. Furthermore, the effects 
      of CBIs were impacted by the different types of DD among the children. This 
      review highlighted the positive effects of CBIs on parental stress levels, 
      depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, parental distress levels, parental 
      well-being levels, and parent‒child relationships. Future well-designed RCTs are 
      needed to further investigate the effects of MBIs and CBT interventions on 
      children with DD and their parents, as well as the factors and mechanisms of 
      action affecting the efficacy of these interventions.

AB  - Chronic alcohol misuse can result in chronically elevated interleukin (IL)-6, a 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine, in the bloodstream. Given that Mindfulness-Based 
      Relapse Prevention (MBRP) has been shown to reduce alcohol misuse, MBRP might 
      also be effective in reducing IL-6 concentrations. Past research has found, 
      however, that IL-6 does not respond consistently to mindfulness-based 
      interventions. Building on prior studies, we examined whether between-person 
      variability in engagement with mindfulness training (i.e., formal mindfulness 
      practice time) is associated with between-person variability in changes in serum 
      IL-6, using data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating MBRP for Alcohol 
      Dependence (MBRP-A). Participants were 72 alcohol dependent adults (mean 
      age = 43.4 years, 63.9% male, 93.1% White) who received a minimum dose (i.e., at 
      least four sessions) of MBRP-A either at the start of the trial (n = 46) or after 
      a 26-week delay (n = 26). IL-6 concentrations did not significantly change from 
      pre- to post-intervention for the full sample. Nevertheless, greater mindfulness 
      practice time was significantly associated with reduced IL-6 levels (r = -0.27). 
      The association between practice time and IL-6 changes remained significant when 
      controlling for intervention timing (i.e., immediate or after the 26-week delay), 
      demographic characteristics, and changes in mindful awareness, 
      obsessive-compulsive drinking, and depressive symptoms. The association between 
      practice time and IL-6 changes was not significant when omitting the minimum 
      treatment dose requirement. Overall, results suggest that the level of engagement 
      in mindfulness training may predict changes in the inflammatory pathophysiology 
      in adults with alcohol dependence.

AB  - Reward insensitivity is a potential key mechanism regarding the maintenance of 
      depression. However, there is a lack of research examining and comparing the 
      effectiveness of different psychological interventions in modifying reward 
      insensitivity. This four-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated a 
      two-week online intervention. After screening for eligibility, a total of 336 
      participants were randomized, and 224 participated per-protocol. Participants 
      were assigned to either a) behavioral activation, b) mindfulness and gratitude, 
      c) a combination of both, or d) a waitlist control condition. They received 
      videos and implemented daily exercises. Reward sensitivity and depressive 
      symptoms served as primary outcomes. Behavioral activation and mindfulness 
      significantly improved depressive symptoms and reward sensitivity. However, the 
      effects of behavioral activation were not superior. The combination treatment 
      versus the waiting group was insignificant regarding reward insensitivity. 
      Explorative analyses revealed that all intervention groups reduced anhedonia 
      substantially. Our findings imply that brief online interventions with behavioral 
      activation and mindfulness-based approaches can impact reward insensitivity, 
      while effects for a combination were less clear. Nonetheless, our results do not 
      allow us to infer the differential effectiveness of the interventions. There is a 
      clear need for treatments better targeting maintaining factors of depression, 
      such as reward insensitivity. Clinical trial registration number: NCT05402150.

TI  - Group, Blended and Individual, Unguided Online Delivery of Mindfulness-Based 
      Cognitive Therapy for People With Cancer: Feasibility Uncontrolled Trial.
PG  - e52338
LID - 10.2196/52338 [doi]
LID - e52338
AB  - BACKGROUND: Online mindfulness based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) has been shown to 
      reduce psychological distress in people with cancer. However, this population has 
      reported lack of support and asynchronous communication as barriers to eMBCT, 
      resulting in higher nonadherence rates than with face-to-face MBCT. Using a 
      co-creation process, we developed 2 formats of eMBCT: group, blended (combination 
      of therapist-guided group and individual online sessions) and individual, 
      unguided (individual, unguided online sessions only). Group, blended eMBCT offers 
      peer support and guidance, whereas individual, unguided eMBCT offers flexibility 
      and the possibility of large-scale implementation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of 
      this nonrandomized feasibility study was to assess aspects of feasibility of the 
      group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT interventions. METHODS: 
      Participants were people with cancer who chose between group, blended and 
      individual, unguided eMBCT. Both intervention conditions followed the same 8-week 
      eMBCT program, including an introductory session and a silent day (10 sessions 
      total). All sessions for individual, unguided eMBCT occurred via the platform 
      Minddistrict, whereas group, blended eMBCT consisted of 3 online videoconference 
      sessions guided by a mindfulness teacher and 5 sessions via Minddistrict. We 
      assessed the feasibility of the intervention quantitatively and qualitatively by 
      evaluating its acceptability among participants. Additionally, we assessed 
      limited efficacy by looking at the number of questionnaires participants 
      completed pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: We included 12 participants for 
      each eMBCT condition. Participants in group, blended eMBCT completed, on average, 
      9.7 of 10 sessions, compared with an average 8.3 sessions for individual, 
      unguided eMBCT (excluding dropouts). Of the 24 participants, 13 (54%) agreed to 
      be interviewed (5 unguided and 8 blended). Participants in both conditions 
      reported positive experiences, including the convenience of not having to travel 
      and the flexibility to choose when and where to participate. However, among the 
      barriers for participation, participants in the group, blended condition reported 
      a preference for more group sessions, and participants in the individual, 
      unguided condition reported a lack of guidance. Additionally, for the group, 
      blended condition, the effect sizes were small for all outcome measures (Hedges g 
      range=0.01-0.36), except for fatigue, which had a moderate effect size (Hedges 
      g=0.57). For the individual, unguided condition, the effect sizes were small for 
      all outcome measures (Hedges g range=0.24-0.46), except for mindfulness skills 
      (Hedges g=0.52) and engagement with the intervention (Hedges g=1.53). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study had a positive experience with group, 
      blended and individual, unguided eMBCT. Based on the results from this study, we 
      will adjust the intervention prior to conducting a full-scale randomized 
      controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness; we will add 1 group session to the 
      group, blended eMBCT using Zoom as the platform for the group sessions; and we 
      will send reminders to participants to complete questionnaires. TRIAL

TI  - Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement vs Supportive Group Therapy for 
      Co-occurring Opioid Misuse and Chronic Pain in Primary Care: A Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - 407-417
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.0033 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Successful treatment of opioid misuse among people with chronic pain 
      has proven elusive. Guidelines recommend nonopioid therapies, but the efficacy of 
      mindfulness-based interventions for opioid misuse is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) for the 
      reduction of opioid misuse and chronic pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This interviewer-blinded randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from primary 
      care clinics in Utah between January 4, 2016, and January 16, 2020. The study 
      included 250 adults with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy who were 
      misusing opioid medications. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with MORE (comprising 
      training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring positive experiences) or 
      supportive group psychotherapy (control condition) across 8 weekly 2-hour group 
      sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were (1) opioid misuse 
      assessed by the Drug Misuse Index (self-report, interview, and urine screen) and 
      (2) pain severity and pain-related functional interference, assessed by subscale 
      scores on the Brief Pain Inventory through 9 months of follow-up. Secondary 
      outcomes were opioid dose, emotional distress, and ecological momentary 
      assessments of opioid craving. The minimum intervention dose was defined as 4 or 
      more completed sessions of MORE or supportive group psychotherapy. RESULTS: Among 
      250 participants (159 women [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [11.9] years), 129 were 
      randomized to the MORE group and 121 to the supportive psychotherapy group. 
      Overall, 17 participants (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino, 218 (87.2%) were White, 
      and 15 (6.0%) were of other races and/or ethnicities (2 American Indian, 3 Asian, 
      1 Black, 2 Pacific Islander, and 7 did not specify). At baseline, the mean 
      duration of pain was 14.7 years (range, 1-60 years), and the mean (SD) 
      morphine-equivalent opioid dose was 101.0 (266.3) mg (IQR, 16.0-90.0 mg). A total 
      of 203 participants (81.2%) received the minimum intervention dose (mean [SD], 
      5.7 [2.2] sessions); at 9 months, 92 of 250 participants (36.8%) discontinued the 
      study. The overall odds ratio for reduction in opioid misuse through the 9-month 
      follow-up period in the MORE group compared with the supportive psychotherapy 
      group was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.17-3.61; P = .01). At 9 months, 36 of 80 participants 
      (45.0%) in the MORE group were no longer misusing opioids compared with 19 of 78 
      participants (24.4%) in the supportive psychotherapy group. Mixed models 
      demonstrated that MORE was superior to supportive psychotherapy through 9 months 
      of follow-up for pain severity (between-group effect: 0.49; 95% CI, 0.17-0.81; 
      P = .003) and pain-related functional interference (between-group effect: 1.07; 
      95% CI, 0.64-1.50; P < .001). Participants in the MORE group reduced their opioid 
      dose to a greater extent than those in the supportive psychotherapy group. The 
      MORE group also had lower emotional distress and opioid craving. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, among adult participants in a 
      primary care setting, the MORE intervention led to sustained improvements in 
      opioid misuse and chronic pain symptoms and reductions in opioid dosing, 
      emotional distress, and opioid craving compared with supportive group 
      psychotherapy. Despite attrition caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
      vulnerability of the sample, MORE appeared to be efficacious for reducing opioid 
      misuse among adults with chronic pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Post-9/11 Veterans and Their Partners Improve Mental Health Outcomes with a 
      Self-directed Mobile and Web-based Wellness Training Program: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e255
LID - e255
AB  - BACKGROUND: Veterans with history of deployment in the Global War on Terror face 
      significant and ongoing challenges with high prevalences of adverse 
      psychological, physical, spiritual, and family impacts. Together, these 
      challenges contribute to an emerging public health crisis likely to extend well 
      into the future. Innovative approaches are needed that reach veterans and their 
      family members with strategies they can employ over time in their daily lives to 
      promote improved adjustment and well-being. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      study was to evaluate effects of use of a Web-based, self-directed program of 
      instruction in mind- and body-based wellness skills to be employed by Global War 
      on Terror veterans and their significant relationship partners on mental health 
      and wellness outcomes associated with postdeployment readjustment. METHODS: We 
      recruited 160 veteran-partner dyads in 4 regions of the United States (San Diego, 
      CA; Dallas, TX; Fayetteville, NC; and New York, NY) through publicity by the Iraq 
      and Afghanistan Veterans of America to its membership. Dyads were randomly 
      allocated to 1 of 4 study arms: Mission Reconnect (MR) program alone, MR plus the 
      Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) for Strong Bonds weekend 
      program for military couples, PREP alone, and waitlist control. We administered a 
      battery of standardized and investigator-generated instruments assessing mental 
      health outcomes at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Dyads in the MR arms were 
      provided Web-based and mobile app video and audio instruction in a set of 
      mindfulness-related stress reduction and contemplative practices, as well as 
      partner massage for reciprocal use. All participants provided weekly reports on 
      frequency and duration of self-care practices for the first 8 weeks, and at 16 
      weeks. RESULTS: During the first 8-week reporting period, veterans and partners 
      assigned to MR arms used some aspect of the program a mean of 20 times per week, 
      totaling nearly 2.5 hours per week, with only modest declines in use at 16 weeks. 
      Significant improvements were seen at 8 and 16 weeks in measures of posttraumatic 
      stress disorder, depression, sleep quality, perceived stress, resilience, 
      self-compassion, and pain for participants assigned to MR arms. In addition, 
      significant reductions in self-reported levels of pain, tension, irritability, 
      anxiety, and depression were associated with use of partner massage. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Both veterans and partners were able to learn and make sustained use of a range 
      of wellness practices taught in the MR program. Home-based, self-directed 
      interventions may be of particular service to veterans who are distant from, 
      averse to, or prohibited by schedule from using professional services. Leveraging 
      the partner relationship may enhance sustained use of self-directed interventions 
      for this population. Use of the MR program appears to be an accessible, low-cost 
      approach that supports well-being and reduces multiple symptoms among post-9/11 
      veterans and their partners. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01680419;

TI  - Feasibility and pilot study of a brief self-compassion intervention addressing 
      body image distress in breast cancer survivors.
PG  - 498-526
LID - 10.1080/21642850.2021.1929236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) experience body image 
      concerns following treatment. Body Image distress (BID) is associated with 
      psychological distress and diminished quality of life. A web-based 
      self-compassion focused writing activity (My Changed Body - MyCB) reduces BID in 
      BCSs, yet limited research exists on participant characteristics associated with 
      such intervention adherence. Self-compassion-based meditations are also 
      efficacious in reducing BID in non-BCS populations. This parallel, double-blind 
      pilot randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the feasibility and 
      acceptability of MyCB, with and without an additional meditation component, on 
      BID and related psychological outcomes in BCSs. The trial was registered with the 
      Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (#ACTRN12619001693112). 
      METHODS: BCSs were randomly allocated to MyCB (n = 39), MyCB + Meditation 
      (MyCB + M) (n = 17) or an expressive writing (EW) active control arm (n = 23). 
      The primary outcome was BID. Secondary outcomes were body appreciation, affect 
      (positive and negative), psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress) 
      and self-compassion (state and trait). Assessments were completed online at 
      baseline, post-intervention and 1-month. RESULTS: Adherence to the MyCB writing 
      (45%) and meditation (50%) was modest, and acceptability was high for both MyCB 
      and MyCB + M. Intent to treat linear mixed model analyses indicated: 
      Post-intervention - state self-compassion and positive affect increased for MyCB 
      compared to EW; 1-month: BID scores decreased across all conditions; trait 
      self-compassion increased and anxiety decreased for MyCB + M compared to MyCB and 
      EW. CONCLUSION: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy and 
      potential clinical use of the MyCB brief web-based self-compassion intervention 
      alone and with the addition of meditation, to increase self-compassion and 
      psychological wellbeing in BCSs.

      reactivity to emotional stimuli.

AB  - Meditation training can improve mood and emotion regulation, yet the neural 
      mechanisms of these affective changes have yet to be fully elucidated. We 
      evaluated the impact of long- and short-term mindfulness meditation training on 
      the amygdala response to emotional pictures in a healthy, non-clinical population 
      of adults using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging. Long-term meditators (N = 30, 16 female) had 9081 h of lifetime practice 
      on average, primarily in mindfulness meditation. Short-term training consisted of 
      an 8-week Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction course (N = 32, 22 female), which 
      was compared to an active control condition (N = 35, 19 female) in a randomized 
      controlled trial. Meditation training was associated with less amygdala 
      reactivity to positive pictures relative to controls, but there were no group 
      differences in response to negative pictures. Reductions in reactivity to 
      negative stimuli may require more practice experience or concentrated practice, 
      as hours of retreat practice in long-term meditators was associated with lower 
      amygdala reactivity to negative pictures - yet we did not see this relationship 
      for practice time with MBSR. Short-term training, compared to the control 
      intervention, also led to increased functional connectivity between the amygdala 
      and a region implicated in emotion regulation - ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
      (VMPFC) - during affective pictures. Thus, meditation training may improve 
      affective responding through reduced amygdala reactivity, and heightened 
      amygdala-VMPFC connectivity during affective stimuli may reflect a potential 
      mechanism by which MBSR exerts salutary effects on emotion regulation ability.

TI  - Feasibility of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Surgical Intensive Care Unit 
      Personnel.
PG  - 10-18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical intensive care unit personnel are exposed to catastrophic 
      situations as they care for seriously injured or ill patients. Few interventions 
      have been developed to reduce the negative effects of work stress in this 
      environment. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a workplace 
      intervention for increasing resilience to stress. The intervention was 
      implemented within the unique constraints characteristic of surgical intensive 
      care units. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or 
      control group. The mindfulness-based intervention included meditation, mild yoga 
      movement, and music and was conducted in a group format 1 hour a week for 8 weeks 
      in a surgical intensive care unit during work hours. Assessments were performed 1 
      week before and 1 week after the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention was well 
      received, with a 97% overall retention rate and 100% retention in the 
      intervention group. Work satisfaction, measured with the Utrecht Work Engagement 
      Scale, increased significantly in the intervention group with no change in the 
      control group. Negative correlations were found between the vigor subscale scores 
      of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and scores for emotional exhaustion on the 
      Maslach Burnout Inventory and scores for burnout on the Professional Quality of 
      Life scale. Participants rated recognizing their stress response as a main 
      benefit of the intervention. CONCLUSION: Workplace group interventions aimed at 
      decreasing the negative effects of stress can be applied within hospital 
      intensive care units. Despite many constraints, attendance at weekly sessions was 
      high. Institutional support was critical for implementation of this program.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Vagus nerve innervation via electrical stimulation and 
      meditative-based diaphragmatic breathing may be promising treatment avenues for 
      fibromyalgia. OBJECTIVE: Explore and compare the treatment effectiveness of 
      active and sham transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) and 
      meditative-based diaphragmatic breathing (MDB) for fibromyalgia. DESIGN: 
      Participants enrolled from March 2019-October 2020 and randomly assigned to 
      active tVNS (n = 28), sham tVNS (n = 29), active MDB (n = 29), or sham MDB (n = 
      30). Treatments were self-delivered at home for 15 min/morning and 15 min/evening 
      for 14 days. Follow-up was at 2 weeks. SETTING: Outpatient pain clinic in Oslo, 
      Norway. PARTICIPANTS: 116 adults aged 18-65 years with severe fibromyalgia were 
      consecutively enrolled and randomized. 86 participants (74%) had an 80% treatment 
      adherence and 107 (92%) completed the study at 2 weeks; 1 participant dropped out 
      due to adverse effects from active tVNS. INTERVENTIONS: Active tVNS is placed on 
      the cymba conchae of the left ear; sham tVNS is placed on the left earlobe. 
      Active MDB trains users in nondirective meditation with deep breathing; sham MDB 
      trains users in open-awareness meditation with paced breathing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Primary outcome was change from baseline in ultra short-term 
      photoplethysmography-measured cardiac-vagal heart rate variability at 2 weeks. 
      Prior to trial launch, we hypothesized that (1) those randomized to active MDB or 
      active tVNS would display greater increases in heart rate variability compared to 
      those randomized to sham MDB or sham tVNS after 2-weeks; (2) a change in heart 
      rate variability would be correlated with a change in self-reported average pain 
      intensity; and (3) active treatments would outperform sham treatments on all 
      pain-related secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: No significant across-group 
      changes in heart rate variability were found. Furthermore, no significant 
      correlations were found between changes in heart rate variability and average 
      pain intensity during treatment. Significant across group differences were found 
      for overall FM severity yet were not found for average pain intensity. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that changes in cardiac-vagal 
      heart rate variability when recorded with ultra short-term photoplethysmography 
      in those with fibromyalgia may not be associated with treatment-specific changes 
      in pain intensity. Further research should be conducted to evaluate potential 
      changes in long-term cardiac-vagal heart rate variability in response to 
      noninvasive vagus nerve innervation in those with fibromyalgia. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - Enhancing Social Interaction in Depression (SIDE study): protocol of a randomised 
      controlled trial on the effects of a Cognitively Based Compassion Training (CBCT) 
      for couples.
PG  - e020448

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Positive social interactions (PSIs) and stable relationships can 
      exert substantial benefits on health. However, patients suffering from depression 
      benefit less from these health-promoting effects. Moreover, relationship quality 
      and even partners' health has been found to be negatively affected by depressive 
      symptomatology, which may result in overall impairments in social functioning of 
      a romantic couple. Psychobiological research indicates that these impairments may 
      be accompanied by a maladaptive regulation of the patient's neuroendocrine 
      response to external stressors. Concerning the improvement of social functioning, 
      first studies showed promising results of "Cognitively Based Compassion Training 
      (CBCT®)". However, randomised trials are still scarce. Previous programmes did 
      not involve participation of the patient's romantic partner. Therefore, the 
      present study aims to investigate whether a CBCT® programme adapted for couples 
      (CBCT®-fC) can improve depressive symptoms, distress, social interaction skills 
      and the neurobiological regulation of stress. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Couples with 
      the female partner suffering from depression will be invited to participate in a 
      pre-to-post intervention assessment on two consecutive days, respectively, 
      involving a standardised PSI task, eye-tracking, ECG recordings, saliva-sampling, 
      blood-sampling and questionnaire data. After baseline assessment, participating 
      couples will be randomised to either a 10 week CBCT®-fC or to a treatment as 
      usual control condition. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive 
      symptoms measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes 
      encompass self-rated depression (Beck Depression Inventory), attention towards 
      the partners face during PSI (eye tracking), stress-related biomarkers (cortisol, 
      α-amylase, interleukin (IL)-1ß/IL-6, heart rate variability), methylation of 
      oxytocin-receptor-genes and serotonin-transporter-genes and self-ratings of 
      psychological constructs such as relationship quality and empathy. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained by the Ethics Committee of the 
      Medical Faculty Heidelberg. Results will be presented in international, 
      peer-reviewed journals and on conferences in the field of clinical psychology and 
      psychiatry. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03080025.

TI  - Long-term improvements after mindfulness-based group therapy of depression, 
      anxiety and stress and adjustment disorders: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 943-952
LID - 10.1111/eip.12715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although mindfulness-based group therapies (MGTs) for depressive, 
      anxiety or stress and adjustment disorders are promising, there is a substantial 
      lack of knowledge regarding the long-term improvements after such therapies in 
      these common psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients 
      were randomized in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: 
      NCT01476371) conducted in 2012 at 16 primary healthcare centres in southern 
      Sweden. The patients were randomized to MGT or treatment as usual (TAU) and 
      completed four psychometric self-rated scales after 8 weeks of treatment. 
      Approximately 12 months after the completion of the 8-week treatment, the same 
      scales were repeated. Ordinal and generalized linear-mixed models, adjusted for 
      cluster effects, were used for the analysis. RESULTS: For all four psychometric 
      scales (MADRS-S [Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-S], HADS-D, HADS-A 
      [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale A and D] and PHQ-9 [Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9]) the scores at the 1-year follow-up were significantly improved 
      (all P values <0.001) in both groups. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences between the MGT and TAU in the psychometric scores at the 1-year 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT 
      comparing the long-term improvements after MGT with TAU. Although it cannot be 
      excluded that our findings are a result of the natural course of common 
      psychiatric disorders or other factors, they suggest a long-term positive 
      improvement after both MGT and TAU.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to test the relationship between past-year 
      suicide attempt (SA) and past-year opioid misuse among Veterans at high risk of 
      suicide who reported using at least one illicit substance or alcohol in the past 
      year. Baseline data from 130 high suicide-risk Veterans (n = 39 past-year opioid 
      misusers; n = 91 past-year users of other substances) who enrolled in a 
      randomized controlled trial testing adjunctive Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
      Therapy to Prevent Suicidal Behavior were used. Information was collected on a 
      semi-structured interview that included the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
      Scale to collect suicide attempt history. Past-year opioid misusers, compared to 
      those who used at least one other illicit substance or alcohol in the past year, 
      were more likely to have made a past-year SA. Past-year opioid misuse remained

      risk factors for SA. Our findings show a robust link between near-term SA and 
      opioid misuse in Veterans.

TI  - Impact of a combined multimodal-aerobic and multimodal intervention compared to 
      standard aerobic treatment in breast cancer survivors with chronic cancer-related 
      fatigue - results of a three-armed pragmatic trial in a comprehensive cohort 
      design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and insomnia are major complaints in 
      breast cancer survivors (BC). Aerobic training (AT), the standard therapy for CRF 
      in BC, shows only minor to moderate treatment effects. Other evidence-based 
      treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy, e.g., sleep 
      education/restriction (SE) and mindfulness-based therapies. We investigated the 
      effectiveness of a 10-week multimodal program (MT) consisting of SE, 
      psycho-education, eurythmy- and painting-therapy, administered separately or in 
      combination with AT (CT) and compared both arms to AT alone. METHODS: In a 
      pragmatic comprehensive cohort study BC with chronic CRF were allocated randomly 
      or by patient preference to (a) MT, (b) CT (MT + AT) or (c) AT alone. Primary 
      endpoint was a composite score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the 
      Cancer Fatigue Scale after 10 weeks of intervention (T1); a second endpoint was a 
      follow-up assessment 6 months later (T2). The primary hypothesis stated 
      superiority of CT and non-inferiority of MT vs. AT at T1. A closed testing 
      procedure preserved the global α-level. The intention-to-treat analysis included 
      propensity scores for the mode of allocation and for the preferred treatment, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Altogether 126 BC were recruited: 65 were randomized and 
      61 allocated by preference; 105 started the intervention. Socio-demographic 
      parameters were generally balanced at baseline. Non-inferiority of MT to AT at T1 
      was confirmed (p < 0.05), yet the confirmative analysis stopped as it was not 
      possible to confirm superiority of CT vs. AT (p = 0.119). In consecutive 
      exploratory analyses MT and CT were superior to AT at T1 and T2 (MT) or T2 alone 
      (CT), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal CRF-therapy was found to be 
      confirmatively non-inferior to standard therapy and even yielded exploratively 
      sustained superiority. A randomized controlled trial including a larger sample 
      size and a longer follow-up to evaluate multimodal CRF-therapy is highly 
      warranted. TRIAL REGISTER: DRKS-ID: DRKS00003736 . Recruitment period June 2011

      Preliminary Efficacy of the Mindfulness Based Health Promotion Program on the 
      Quality of Life of Older Adults Assisted in Primary Care-"The MBHP-Elderly 
      Study".

AB  - Introduction: Population aging is a global phenomenon that has grown rapidly and 
      progressively all over the world. Interventions that promote health must be 
      studied and implemented to make the aging process be with quality of life. 
      Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions that 
      compromise the quality of life on the elderly and it can cause damage to the 
      autonomy and activities of daily life. Mindfulness training has been shown to 
      improve psychological health and quality of life on adults. Studies involving 
      Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) with older people are scarce in the 
      literature, but they have been increasing in recent years showing promising 
      results for healthy aging. This trial will investigate the feasibility and 
      preliminary efficacy of an MBI on the quality of life of elderly assisted in the 
      Primary Care. Materials and Methods: A cohort-nested randomized controlled trial 
      with 3 assessment points (baseline, post-intervention and 1-year follow up) will 
      be conducted to compare a MBI program (Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion) to a 
      cognitive stimulation control-group in a Primary Care facility. One-hundred and 
      two older adults will be recruited from a cohort of this facility and they will 
      be randomized and allocated into an intervention group (N = 76) and the control 
      group (N = 76). The primary outcome evaluated will be the improvement of quality 
      of life assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD. The secondary outcomes will 
      be cognitive function, psychological health, sleep quality, self-compassion, and 
      religiosity. Qualitative data will be assessed by focus group and the word free 
      evocation technique. The feasibility of the program will also be evaluated by 
      adherence and unwanted effects questionnaires. Discussion: This cohort-nested 
      clinical trial will be the first mixed-methods study with 3 assessment points 
      which will study the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness-based 
      program for older people in Latin America population. If the findings of this 
      study confirm the effectiveness of this program in this population it will be 
      possible to consider it as intervention that might be implemented as public 
      policy addressed to older people in healthcare systems. Clinical Trial

      Trial.

AB  - A person affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) gradually loses the ability to 
      perform activities of daily living and becomes dependent on caregivers, thereby 
      having a negative impact on the caregivers' quality of life. There is evidence 
      that suggests that interventions aimed at caregivers, such as mindfulness, may be 
      effective at reducing this burden and emotional issues, such as depression and 
      anxiety, and improving their quality of life. However, there is a lack of 
      consistency in the findings and conclusions remain tentative. In addition, as 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) of AD are major determinants of the caregiver's 
      burden, these interventions should examine the relationship between these 
      symptoms and caregiver outcomes. Importantly, to improve the design of 
      therapeutic interventions for caregivers and complement the treatment of AD, 
      aspects related to occupational performance and the participation of people with 
      AD and their caregivers should also be considered. Therefore, this study will aim 
      to examine first, the effects of a mindfulness-based program designed for 
      caregivers on NPSs of AD and caregivers' anxiety and depression; second, the 
      effects of this program on patients' functional capacity, cognitive performance, 
      executive functions, and quality of life, and on caregivers' burden, quality of 
      life, occupational balance, executive functions, psychological wellbeing, and 
      self-compassion. We believe that the findings of this study will have significant 
      implications for future healthcare strategies focused on improving the quality of 
      life and wellbeing of caregivers.

TI  - Effects of a Mental Health Intervention in Athletes: Applying Self-Determination 
      Theory.

AB  - Introduction: Many sport associations have responded to mental health issues in 
      sport through the inclusion of self-management programs, such as mindfulness 
      training, which may improve well-being through increasing one's competence in 
      self-regulating stressors. Yet, the mechanisms accounting such changes lack a 
      theoretical basis, particularly in athletes. Aim: To determine the effect of a 
      mental health intervention comprising a mindfulness program for promoting 
      well-being, reducing stress, and increasing competence in mental health 
      self-management. This is the first study among athletes to test the mechanisms of 
      change in a mindfulness program using Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Methods: A 
      2 (groups) × 2 (time-point) non-randomized controlled trial was conducted, and 
      between-groups baseline differences were firstly assessed. Two competing 
      regression models assessing singular and serial indirect mediating mechanisms 
      were conducted, in which mindfulness (Model 1) and competence satisfaction (Model 
      2) were both tested as primary and secondary mediators predicting change scores 
      in stress and well-being. Demographic variables (i.e., gender, age) were 
      controlled for in the analyses. Results: Two hundred and thirty-eight student 
      athletes (mean age = 20.47 years, SD = 3.30, 57.6% = males) participated, with 
      108 in the intervention group who received an instructional workshop, and a 
      home-directed mindfulness program comprising daily meditation sessions. No 
      baseline differences were found between intervention and control groups. In Model 
      1, mindfulness was not directly enhanced by the intervention, subsequently 
      resulting in no indirect effects on competence, stress and well-being. In Model 
      2, the intervention was directly related to positive changes in competence (β = 
      0.39, p < 0.05), subsequently resulting in indirect effects on mindfulness 
      awareness (β = 0.07, p < 0.05), stress (β = -0.06, p < 0.05), and well-being (β = 
      0.05, p < 0.05). In addition, serial indirect effects for the intervention on 
      stress were present through competence and mindfulness awareness in sequence (β = 
      -0.02, p < 0.05), and; on well-being through competence, mindfulness awareness, 
      and stress in sequence (β = 0.01, p < 0.05; R (2) = 0.54). Conclusion: 
      Mindfulness-based mental health interventions may be effective at reducing stress 
      and promoting well-being in athletes, with the caveat that attention is given to 
      the inclusion of mental health competence promotion in program design. However, 
      it remains unclear whether increasing mindfulness itself can exert additional 
      salutary effects. Our findings have an important bearing on how mindfulness 
      programs are developed within athlete mental health interventions.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer survivors (MBSR(BC)): 
      evaluating mediators of psychological and physical outcomes in a large randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 591-604
LID - 10.1007/s10865-021-00214-0 [doi]
AB  - MBSR(BC) is known to have a positive impact on psychological and physical 
      symptoms among breast cancer survivors (BCS). The cognitive mechanisms of "how" 
      MBSR(BC) works was addressed in a recent study that found that there was strong 
      consistent evidence that reduced emotional reactivity is a mediator and moderate 
      consistent evidence that mindfulness, rumination, and worry were mediators. The 
      purpose of this study, as part of a larger R01 trial, was to test whether 
      positive effects achieved from the MBSR(BC) program were mediated through changes 
      in increased mindfulness, decreased fear of breast cancer recurrence, and 
      perceived stress. Female BCS > 21 years diagnosed with Stage 0-III breast cancer 
      were randomly assigned to a 6-week MBSR(BC) or a Usual Care (UC)regimen. 
      Potential mediators of 6- and 12-week outcomes were identified by analysis of 
      covariance (ANCOVA), followed by formal mediational analyses of main effects of 
      MBSR(BC) on 6- and 12-week outcomes, including percentage of total effects 
      explained. Among 322 BCS (167 MBSR(BC) and 155 UC), fear of recurrence and 
      perceived stress, but not mindfulness, mediated reductions in anxiety and fatigue 
      at weeks 6 and 12, partially supporting our hypothesis of cognitive mechanisms of 
      MBSR(BC). TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration Number: NCT01177124

TI  - Associations of mindfulness with nicotine dependence, withdrawal, and agency.
PG  - 318-27
LID - 10.1080/08897070903252973 [doi]
AB  - Quitting smoking is a major life stressor that results in numerous aversive 
      consequences, including persistently increased level of post-cessation negative 
      affect and relapse. The identification of factors that may enhance behavioral and 
      emotional regulation after quitting may be useful in enhancing quit rates and 
      preventing relapse. One factor broadly linked with behavioral and emotional 
      regulation is mindfulness. This study examined baseline associations of 
      mindfulness with demographic variables, smoking history, dependence, withdrawal 
      severity, and agency among 158 smokers enrolled in a cessation trial. Results 
      indicated that mindfulness was negatively associated with level of nicotine 
      dependence and withdrawal severity, and positively associated with a sense of 
      agency regarding cessation. Moreover, mindfulness remained significantly 
      associated with these measures even after controlling for key demographic 
      variables. Results suggest that low level of mindfulness may be an important 
      predictor of vulnerability to relapse among adult smokers preparing to quit; 
      thus, mindfulness-based interventions may enhance cessation.

      mindfulness based stress reduction versus active control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a secular form of 
      meditation training. The vast majority of the extant literature investigating the 
      health effects of mindfulness interventions relies on wait-list control 
      comparisons. Previous studies have found that meditation training over several 
      months is associated with improvements in cognitive control and attention. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a visual continuous performance task 
      (CPT) to test the effects of eight weeks of mindfulness training on sustained 
      attention by comparing MBSR to the Health Enhancement Program (HEP), a 
      structurally equivalent, active control condition in a randomized, longitudinal 
      design (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01301105) focusing on a non-clinical population 
      typical of MBSR participants. Researchers were blind to group assignment. 63 
      community participants were randomized to either MBSR (n = 31) or HEP (n = 32). 
      CPT analyses were conducted on 29 MBSR participants and 25 HEP participants. We 
      predicted that MBSR would improve visual discrimination ability and sustained 
      attention over time on the CPT compared to HEP, with more home practice 
      associated with greater improvements. Our hypotheses were not confirmed but we 
      did find some evidence for improved visual discrimination similar to effects in 
      partial replication of other research. Our study had sufficient power to 
      demonstrate that intervention groups do not differ in their improvement over time 
      in sustained attention performance. One of our primary predictions concerning the 
      effects of intervention on attentional fatigue was significant but not 
      interpretable. CONCLUSIONS: Attentional sensitivity is not affected by 
      mindfulness practice as taught in MBSR, but it is unclear whether mindfulness 
      might positively affect another aspect of attention, vigilance. These results 
      also highlight the relevant procedural modifications required by future research 
      to correctly investigate the role of sustained attention in similar samples.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Crisis Interventions for patients with psychotic symptoms on 
      acute psychiatric wards (amBITION study): Protocol for a feasibility randomised 
      controlled trial.
LID - 43 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inpatient psychiatric care is a scarce and expensive resource in the 
      National Health Service (NHS), with chronic bed shortages being partly driven by 
      high re-admission rates. People often need to go into hospital when they have a 
      mental health crisis due to overwhelming distressing psychotic symptoms, such as 
      hearing voices (hallucinations) or experiencing unusual beliefs (delusions). 
      Brief talking therapies may be helpful for people during an acute inpatient 
      admission as an adjunct to medication in reducing re-admission rates, and despite 
      promising findings from trials in the USA, there have not yet been any clinical 
      trials on this kind of intervention within NHS settings. METHODS/DESIGN: The 
      amBITION study is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a manualised 
      brief talking therapy (Mindfulness-Based Crisis Intervention; MBCI). Inpatients 
      on acute psychiatric wards are eligible for the study if they report at least one 
      positive psychotic symptom, and are willing and able to engage in a talking 
      therapy. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), participants will be randomly 
      allocated to receive either MBCI or a control intervention (Social Activity 
      Therapy; SAT) which will be based on doing activities on the ward with the 
      therapist. The primary objective of the study is to find out whether it is 
      possible to carry out this kind of trial successfully within UK inpatient 
      settings and to find out whether patients and staff find it an acceptable 
      intervention. The secondary objective is to collect pilot data on primary and 
      secondary outcome measures, including re-admission rates at 6 month follow-up. 
      This will provide information on the appropriateness of re-admission as the 
      primary outcome measure for future efficacy trials, as well as data on the 
      acceptability and utility of the clinical self-report measures. DISCUSSION: The 
      results of the feasibility trial will indicate whether a subsequent efficacy 
      pilot trial is warranted, and if so, will provide vital information for the 
      planning of such a trial (e.g. pilot data on expected effect sizes). If future 
      research finds that MBCI is an effective and safe intervention, then patients 
      will benefit from access to better treatment within inpatient care which would 
      reduce re-admission rates. This trial therefore addresses an area of urgent 
      concern for service users, clinicians and the wider NHS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ISRCTN37625384.

TI  - Mindful awareness as a mechanism of change for natural childbirth in pregnant 
      women with high fear of childbirth: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 47

LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) is effective in 
      increasing natural childbirth in pregnant women with high fear of childbirth 
      (FOC) as compared to enhanced care as usual (ECAU). We aimed to examine through 
      which pathway of action MBCP reaches this effect, based on a model of approaching 
      or avoiding the challenges related to childbirth. METHODS: One hundred eleven 
      pregnant women with high FOC were measured pre- and post-intervention on FOC 
      (emotion pathway), catastrophic beliefs about labour pain (cognition pathway) and 
      mindful awareness (attention pathway). A multiple mediation model was used to 
      examine through which pathway the mechanism of change operated in relation to 
      approach (i.e., natural childbirth) versus avoidance (i.e., self-requested 
      caesarean section). RESULTS: It was found that greater mindful awareness (18% 
      R(2) = 0.18, F[1107] = 22.77, p < 0.0001) was the only significant mechanism of 
      change operating through the attentional pathway leading to natural childbirth. 
      More specifically, nonreactivity to inner experience (a facet of mindful 
      awareness) showed to be the strongest mechanism of change. More extensive 
      meditation practice was positively associated with natural childbirth; however, 
      the number of completed MBCP sessions was not associated with the outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An increase in mindful awareness was the strongest mechanism of 
      change for better adaptation to the challenges of childbirth. Decreases in 
      neither FOC nor catastrophic beliefs about labour pain were identified as 
      mechanisms of change. Additionally, the more one meditated, the more one was 
      inclined towards a natural childbirth. MBCP enhances adaptation to the challenges 
      of childbirth and less use of obstetric interventions in the presence of high 
      FOC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR; 4302 ).

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of an Online Mindfulness-Based Intervention for 
      Stress Reduction and Psychological Wellbeing of University Students in Pakistan: 
      A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20085512 [doi]
LID - 5512
AB  - The rise in mental health concerns of university students is causing a serious 
      hinderance to their wellbeing, impeding their functioning. The socio-economic and 
      political friction in low- and middle-income countries adds to their 
      vulnerability and calls for a cost-effective indigenous intervention. 
      Consequently, this study aimed to inform a large definitive trial by assessing 
      the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design 
      evaluating a culturally adapted online Mindfulness Training Course (MTC) used to 
      improve stress and wellbeing among Pakistani university students. A two-arm pilot 
      randomized controlled trial was conducted. University students (n = 156) were 
      randomly assigned to either the MTC group (n = 80) or Wait-list (WL) control 
      group (n = 76) and completed baseline and post-intervention self-report measures 
      for mindfulness, stress and psychological wellbeing. Additionally, 
      semi-structured interviews were conducted with consenting MTC group participants 
      (n = 18) to explore their views about MTC, employing reflexive thematic analysis. 
      Of 80 participants randomized to the MTC group, 32 completed the course, whereas, 
      from the 156 randomized participants, 102 completed assessment surveys. 
      Feasibility and acceptability indicators showed high recruitment, compliance, and 
      adherence to MTC, with practical steps for randomization and online data 
      collection. Further results showed higher levels of mindfulness and psychological 
      wellbeing and lowered stress levels in the MTC group compared to the control 
      group. The attrition and dropout rates were high; however, the feedback from 
      participants who completed the MTC was highly positive and encouraging. In 
      conclusion, if the trial proceeds with increased outreach in a large-scale RCT, 
      the recruitment might be revised to reduce attrition rates. Further 
      recommendations are discussed.

AB  - Few empirical studies have explored the associations between formal and informal 
      mindfulness home practice and outcome in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy 
      (MBCT). In this study ninety-nine participants randomised to MBCT in a 
      multi-centre randomised controlled trial completed self-reported ratings of home 
      practice over 7 treatment weeks. Recurrence of Major Depression was assessed 
      immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months post-treatment. 
      Results identified a significant association between mean daily duration of 
      formal home practice and outcome and additionally indicated that participants who 
      reported that they engaged in formal home practice on at least 3 days a week 
      during the treatment phase were almost half as likely to relapse as those who 
      reported fewer days of formal practice. These associations were independent of 
      the potentially confounding variable of participant-rated treatment plausibility. 
      The current study identified no significant association between informal home 
      practice and outcome, although this may relate to the inherent difficulties in 
      quantifying informal home mindfulness practice. These findings have important 
      implications for clinicians discussing mindfulness-based interventions with their 
      participants, in particular in relation to MBCT, where the amount of participant 
      engagement in home practice appears to have a significant positive impact on 
      outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions are useful in reducing psychologic 
      distress and pain intensity in patients with chronic pain. However, most 
      mindfulness-based interventions are resource-intensive, lengthy, and not feasible 
      for busy orthopaedic surgical practices. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this 
      study was to determine if a 60-second personalized mindfulness-based video 
      exercise is (1) associated with improved pain intensity, emotional distress, and 
      state anxiety compared with an attention placebo control (a time-matched 
      educational pamphlet about pain and stress); and (2) feasible and acceptable for 
      patients with upper extremity injury in an orthopaedic practice. METHODS: This 
      was a single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial of the 
      mindfulness-based video exercise (60 seconds duration, free online) versus an 
      attention placebo control (an educational pamphlet about pain and stress 
      presented to patients to read over 60 seconds). One hundred forty-nine patients 
      presenting for a new or followup appointment at the office of one of two 
      orthopaedic hand and upper extremity outpatient surgical practices at an urban 
      academic hospital were invited to participate between September 2016 and December 
      2016. Of 149 patients screened, 125 patients were randomized and completed a 
      demographic questionnaire, the Numeric Rating Scale to assess pain intensity, the 
      State Anxiety subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess state 
      anxiety, and Emotion Thermometers to assess anxiety, anger, and depression before 
      and after the interventions. Postintervention, patients also completed the Client 
      Satisfaction Questionnaire Scale-3 to assess the acceptability. A mean score of 
      21 or higher is considered acceptable. Feasibility was determined based on number 
      of patients approached who refused participation. The intervention was defined as 
      feasible if refusal rate was lower than 25%. Analysis of covariance was used to 
      test comparative improved pain intensity on the NRS, psychologic distress on the 
      Emotion Thermometers, and state anxiety on the State Anxiety Subscale of the 
      State Trait Anxiety Index after controlling for respective baseline scores. A 
      1-point minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was used on the NRS for 
      pain intensity. RESULTS: Adjusted for the baseline means, compared with patients 
      who received the attention placebo control, patients who participated in the 
      mindfulness-based video exercise demonstrated improved pain intensity 
      (mindfulness-based video exercise: 3.03 ± 0.12; control: 3.49 ± 0.12; mean 
      difference: 0.46 [0.12-0.80]; p = 0.008); state anxiety (mindfulness-based video 
      exercise: 32.35 ± 0.59; control: 35.29 ± 0.59; mean difference: 2.94 [1.29-4.59]; 
      p = 0.001); anxiety symptoms (mindfulness-based video exercise: 1.49 ± 0.19; 
      control: 2.10 ± 0.19; mean difference: 0.61 [0.08-1.14]; p = 0.024); depression 
      (mindfulness-based video exercise: 1.03 ± 0.10; control: 1.47 ± 0.11; mean 
      difference: 0.44 [0.15-0.73]; p = 0.004); and anger (mindfulness-based video 
      exercise: 0.76 ± 0.12; control: 1.36 ± 0.12; mean difference: 0.60 [0.26-0.94]; p 
      = 0.001). However, the observed differences in pain intensity were below 1 point 
      on the NRS, which is the MCID established in patients with chronic pain. No MCID 
      is available for the other measures. The mindfulness-based video exercise was 
      feasible based on a dropout rate of 0%, and acceptability reached the medium 
      range with similar scores in both groups (mindfulness-based video exercise: 20.70 
      ± 5.48; control: 20.52 ± 6.42). CONCLUSIONS: A 60-second mindfulness-based video 
      exercise is feasible to implement and acceptable to patients in busy orthopaedic 
      practices. This video exercise is also effective in improving momentary pain, 
      anxiety, depression, and anger in this population, but it is unclear whether 
      these improved pain and distress levels are meaningful to patients who present 
      with low levels of pain and psychologic distress. Future studies should seek to 
      discern whether the improved pain and distress levels we observed are clinically 
      important or whether the intervention delivers larger effects in subgroups of 
      patients experiencing greater pain intensity and if the improved pain and 
      distress levels are durable. Such studies might also assess cost-effectiveness, 
      because this mindfulness-based tool takes little time and few resources to use, 
      and the effects and durability of multiple sessions of a mindfulness-based video 
      exercise. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

TI  - Age and psychological influences on immune responses to trivalent inactivated 
      influenza vaccine in the meditation or exercise for preventing acute respiratory 
      infection (MEPARI) trial.
PG  - 83-91

AB  - BACKGROUND: Strategies to improve influenza vaccine protection among elderly 
      individuals are an important research priority. Mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction (MBSR) and exercise have been shown to affect aspects of immune 
      function in some populations. We hypothesized that influenza vaccine responses 
      may be enhanced with meditation or exercise training as compared with controls. 
      RESULTS: No differences in vaccine responses were found comparing control to MBSR 
      or exercise. Individuals achieving seroprotective levels of influenza antibody 
      ≥160 units had higher optimism, less anxiety, and lower perceived stress than the 
      nonresponders. Age correlated with influenza antibody responses, but not with 
      IFNγ or IL-10 production. CONCLUSION: The MBSR and exercise training evaluated in 
      this study failed to enhance immune responses to influenza vaccine. However, 
      optimism, perceived stress, and anxiety were correlated in the expected 
      directions with antibody responses to influenza vaccine. METHODS: Healthy 
      individuals≥50 y were randomly assigned to exercise (n=47) or MBSR (n=51) 
      training or a waitlist control condition (n=51). Each participant received 
      trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine after 6 weeks, and had blood draws prior 
      to and 3 and 12 weeks after immunization. Serum influenza antibody, nasal 
      immunoglobulin A, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell interferon-γ (IFNγ) and 
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations were measured. Measures of optimism, 
      perceived stress, and anxiety were obtained over the course of the study. 
      Seroprotection was defined as an influenza antibody concentration≥160 units. 
      Vaccine responses were compared using ANOVA, t tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. 
      The correlation between vaccine responses and age was examined with the Pearson 
      test.

AB  - PROBLEM: Low prenatal well-being has adverse outcomes for mother and infant but 
      few interventions currently exist to promote and maintain prenatal well-being. 
      BACKGROUND: Mindfulness and gratitude based interventions consistently 
      demonstrate benefits in diverse populations. Interventions integrating these 
      constructs have potential to improve psychological and physiological health 
      during pregnancy. AIM: The aim of this pilot study is to examine the effect of a 
      novel gratitude and mindfulness based intervention on prenatal stress, cortisol 
      levels, and well-being. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial was 
      conducted with 46 pregnant women. Participants used an online mindfulness and 
      gratitude intervention 4 times a week for 3 weeks. Measures of prenatal stress, 
      salivary cortisol, gratitude, mindfulness, and satisfaction with life were 
      completed at baseline, 1.5 weeks later, and 3 weeks later. FINDINGS: Intervention 
      participants demonstrated significant reductions in prenatal stress in comparison 
      to the control condition (p=.04). Within subjects reductions in waking (p=.004) 
      and evening cortisol (p>.001) measures were observed for intervention 
      participants. Significant effects were not observed for other well-being 
      outcomes. DISCUSSION: Reducing self-report and physiological stress in pregnancy 
      can improve maternal and infant outcomes. The findings of this pilot study 
      indicate potential direct effects of the intervention on self-reported stress in 
      comparison to a treatment-as-usual control. Effects on a biomarker of stress, 
      cortisol, were also observed within the intervention group. CONCLUSION: A brief 
      mindfulness and gratitude based intervention has the potential to reduce stress 
      in pregnancy. Future research is needed to further explore mechanisms and 
      potential benefits of such interventions.

AB  - The increasing mental health issues among university students during the COVID-19 
      pandemic and the challenges of delivering face-to-face interventions during 
      lockdowns have increased the demand for online interventions. The report presents 
      results from a randomized controlled trial investigating the benefits of online 
      mindfulness interventions delivered by videoconference or podcast during the 
      early phase of the pandemic in Germany. Fifty university students were randomized 
      to a mindfulness intervention conducted by videoconference (n = 25) or to an 
      unguided training provided by podcasts (n = 25). All students participated in a 
      7-week mindfulness intervention. Outcome measures included mindfulness, 
      depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction preintervention and postintervention. 
      The study showed a larger reduction in depression in the videoconferencing group 
      than in the podcast group across per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) 
      analyses. There was a significant increase in mindfulness (PP and ITT samples) 
      and life satisfaction (ITT sample) in both groups. The frequency of home practice 
      was related to positive changes in outcomes but only for the videoconferencing 
      group. The results suggest that mindfulness training delivered via 
      videoconferencing can be a viable option to address depressive symptoms among 
      students. However, both interventions were effective in increasing mindfulness 
      and life satisfaction.

TI  - Efficacy of mindfulness-based intervention ('mindfulness-based joyful sleep') in 
      young and middle-aged individuals with insomnia using a biomarker of inflammatory 
      responses: a prospective protocol of a randomised controlled trial in China.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is a prevalent and significant public health concern. 
      Insomnia can lead to increased inflammatory markers associated with chronic 
      diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Studies suggest 
      that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are more easily delivered within the 
      community than cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) which was 
      recommended as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment by the American 
      Academy of Sleep Medicine, are effective in insomnia treatment and can reduce 
      inflammatory markers level in older individuals with insomnia. This study aims to 
      compare the effectiveness of an MBI to CBT-I in young and middle-aged individuals 
      with insomnia disorder and explore its effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), 
      a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in 
      inflammation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This report describes a protocol for a 
      randomised controlled trial. Seventy eligible participants will be assigned to 
      mindfulness-based joyful sleep or CBT-I for 2-hour sessions weekly for 8 weeks. 
      The primary outcome is sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
      Index, severity of insomnia symptoms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and 
      sleep parameters recorded using sleep diary and polysomnography. Secondary 
      outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression. The exploratory 
      outcome is serum level of NF-κB. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end 
      of the ntervention period and at a 3 month follow-up. Data will be analysed using 
      general linear models, specifically analysis of covariance and analysis of 
      variance will be used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full ethical approval for this 
      study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital, 
      Central South University, Changsha, China (2018-S236). If Mindfulness-Based 
      Joyful Sleep is proven effective, its dissemination will help bridge the gap 
      between the unmet need and the demand for insomnia interventions in China. TRIAL

TI  - Psychosocial and cardiac outcomes of yoga for ICD patients: a randomized clinical 
      control trial.
PG  - 48-62
LID - 10.1111/pace.12252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because as many as 46% of implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
      (ICD) patients experience clinical symptoms of shock anxiety, this randomized 
      controlled study evaluated the efficacy of adapted yoga (vs usual care) in 
      reducing clinical psychosocial risks shown to impact morbidity and mortality in 
      ICD recipients. METHODS: Forty-six participants were randomized to a control 
      group or an 8-week adapted yoga group that followed a standardized protocol with 
      weekly classes and home practice. Medical and psychosocial data were collected at 
      baseline and follow-up, then compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Total shock anxiety 
      decreased for the yoga group and increased for the control group, t(4.43, 36), P 
      < 0.0001, with significant differences between these changes. Similarly, 
      consequential anxiety decreased for the yoga group but increased for the control 
      group t(2.86,36) P = 0.007. Compared to the control, the yoga group had greater 
      overall self-compassion, t(-2.84,37), P = 0.007, and greater mindfulness, 
      t(-2.10,37) P = 0.04, at the end of the study. Exploratory analyses utilizing a 
      linear model (R(2) = 0.98) of observed device-treated ventricular (DTV) events 
      revealed that the expected number of DTV events in the yoga group was 
      significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.0001). Compared to the 
      control, the yoga group had a 32% lower risk of experiencing device-related 
      firings at end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated psychosocial 
      benefits from a program of adapted yoga (vs usual care) for ICD recipients. These 
      data support continued research to better understand the role of complementary 
      medicine to address ICD-specific stress in cardiac outcomes.

TI  - The Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Fidelity Measure (MORE-FM): 
      Development and Validation of a New Tool to Assess Therapist Adherence and 
      Competence.
PG  - 308-322
LID - 10.1080/26408066.2020.1833803 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) is a mind-body 
      therapy that unites complementary aspects of mindfulness training, third-wave 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and principles from positive psychology into 
      an integrative treatment for addiction and its comorbidities. As interest in MORE 
      has grown among researchers and clinicians, there is an increasing need to 
      provide quality assurance measures to ensure treatment integrity during 
      implementation of MORE. Here, we describe the development and validation of the 
      Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Fidelity Measure (MORE-FM). METHOD: We 
      developed a 17-item scale assessing therapist competence and adherence to the 
      MORE treatment manual, which was then used for fidelity monitoring of 40 MORE 
      treatment sessions across two Stage 2 and two Stage 1 RCT for addictive behaviors 
      (e.g., opioid misuse, obesity) involving a total N = 295. RESULTS: Internal 
      consistency for the Adherence (α =.89) and Competence subscales (α =.92) was 
      high, and interrater reliability was adequate (Adherence subscale ICC =.77; 
      Competence subscale ICC =.51), with therapists exhibiting good-to-excellent 
      levels of fidelity across all trials. Importantly, linear mixed modeling 
      indicated that higher levels of overall fidelity were associated with greater 
      reductions in opioid misuse across two Stage 2 RCTs (F(1,48.00) = 7.38, p=.009), 
      indicating that the MORE-FM is a valid measure of treatment fidelity that can 
      predict clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study yielded insights 
      for future iterations of the MORE-FM. In sum, the MORE-FM is a valuable tool for 
      assessing and enhancing the integrity of MORE in future research trials and 
      clinical applications.

PG  - 1293-1302
LID - 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1479071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group face-to-face and individual internet-based mindfulness-based 
      cognitive therapy (MBCT and eMBCT) have been demonstrated to reduce psychological 
      distress for distressed cancer patients in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
      This study focused on the long-term effects of this RCT during the nine-month 
      follow-up period, and on possible predictors, moderators and working mechanisms. 
      METHODS: Distressed cancer patients (n = 245) were randomized to MBCT or eMBCT. 
      Data were collected at baseline, post-treatment, three- and nine-month follow-up. 
      Data were analyzed with linear mixed effect models and (hierarchical) linear 
      regressions. RESULTS: Analyses revealed long-term reductions in psychological 
      distress and rumination, and long-term increases in positive mental health and 
      mental health-related quality of life (QoL) in both interventions over the course 
      of the nine-month follow-up. Interestingly, patients reported less psychological 
      distress in the follow-up period after eMBCT in comparison to MBCT. Less 
      psychological distress, rumination and neuroticism, and more extraversion and 
      agreeableness at baseline predicted less psychological distress at the nine-month 
      follow-up after both interventions. Less mindful and conscientious patients at 
      baseline benefited more from eMBCT than from MBCT. Regarding working mechanisms, 
      changes in mindfulness skills, fear of cancer recurrence and rumination during 
      both interventions predicted less psychological distress at follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest most improvements in cancer patients' increase 
      over time after both interventions. Furthermore, patients seemed to benefit more 
      from eMBCT than MBCT based on psychological distress levels, especially those 
      patients with low levels of mindfulness skills and conscientiousness.

      and mood: results of a pilot study.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1007/s00737-008-0214-3 [doi]
AB  - Stress and negative mood during pregnancy increase risk for poor childbirth 
      outcomes and postnatal mood problems and may interfere with mother-infant 
      attachment and child development. However, relatively little research has focused 
      on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions to reduce stress and negative mood 
      during pregnancy. In this study, we developed and pilot tested an eight-week 
      mindfulness-based intervention directed toward reducing stress and improving mood 
      in pregnancy and early postpartum. We then conducted a small randomized trial 
      (n=31) comparing women who received the intervention during the last half of 
      their pregnancy to a wait-list control group. Measures of perceived stress, 
      positive and negative affect, depressed and anxious mood, and affect regulation 
      were collected prior to, immediately following, and three months after the 
      intervention (postpartum). Mothers who received the intervention showed 
      significantly reduced anxiety (effect size, 0.89; p<0.05) and negative affect 
      (effect size, 0.83; p<0.05) during the third trimester in comparison to those who 
      did not receive the intervention. The brief and nonpharmaceutical nature of this 
      intervention makes it a promising candidate for use during pregnancy.

      associated with greater positive affect in response to the MBSR intervention. 
      METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of community-dwelling English-speaking 
      adults (n = 200) aged ≥ 65, randomly assigned to an eight-week MBSR program or a 
      Waitlist Control group. Our main outcome variable was a five-item measure of 
      positive affect, which was measured at study entry as well as eight weeks and six 
      months later. RESULTS: At the six-month follow-up, we observed group by baseline 
      depressive symptom severity (β = -.17, p = .02) and group by baseline depressive 
      symptom severity by age (β = -.14, p = .05) interactions. Among MBSR 
      participants, greater baseline depressive symptom severity was also associated 
      with less improvement in positive affect at the six-month follow-up (β = -.30, p 
      = .003). Findings were qualified by a significant depressive symptom severity by 
      age interaction (β = -.25, p = .01), such that MBSR participants who were 70 and 
      over with lower baseline depressive symptom severity having the greatest 
      improvement in positive affect at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: MBSR 
      improves positive affect for older adults with lower depressive symptom severity, 
      perhaps because it capitalizes on naturalistic changes in control strategies.

AB  - Past research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions increase positive 
      affect in non-clinical populations. However, the mechanisms underlying this 
      increase are poorly understood. On the basis of previous empirical and 
      theoretical accounts, we hypothesized that a decreased use of disengagement 
      coping strategies in daily life would explain the benefits of a mindfulness-based 
      intervention in terms of increased positive affect. We analysed the data of 75 
      healthy adult participants (58 women; 17 men) of different ages (M = 49 years 
      old; SD = 13; age range 19-81) who had been randomly allocated to 8-week 
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waitlist control group. The 
      results confirmed our hypothesis: Participants in the MBCT group showed 
      significant improvements in positive affect compared to the control group, with 
      decreased use of disengagement coping styles mediating these improvements. The 
      implications of this study are discussed.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Versus a Health Enhancement Program in the 
      Treatment of Urge Urinary Incontinence in Older Adult Women: A Randomized 
      Controlled Feasibility Study.
PG  - 285-297
LID - 10.3928/19404921-20190702-02 [doi]
AB  - Current treatment practices for older adult women with urge urinary incontinence 
      (UUI) remain insufficient and ineffective. A randomized controlled feasibility 
      trial was developed to evaluate three determinants of research feasibility and 
      three determinants of intervention feasibility when comparing mindfulness-based 
      stress reduction (MBSR) with a health enhancement program (HEP) in older adult 
      women with UUI. Participants were recruited from the university health system, 
      county senior centers, and community sites. Twenty-five postmenopausal women 
      (mean age = 74 years) were randomized into MBSR treatment conditions or HEP 
      comparison conditions for an 8-week intervention. Participants remained blinded 
      to conditions. Research feasibility determinants were measured as recruitment, 
      retention, and treatment delivery; intervention feasibility determinants were 
      measured as acceptability, tolerability, and client receipt/enactment. 
      Feasibility determinants established in the research literature as essential to 
      intervention evaluation were recorded and evaluated throughout the current study. 
      All six feasibility determinants confirmed positive results in the enrolled 
      population. The use of MBSR and HEP as the active comparison to treat UUI in 
      older adult women proved feasible in this trial. The results warrant the design 
      of a larger-scale, multisite trial to study the efficacy of MBSR in treating UUI 
      in older adult women. TARGETS: Older adult women with high incidence of UUI. 
      INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION: MBSR treatment conditions or HEP comparison conditions. 
      MECHANISMS OF ACTION: Research and intervention feasibility determinants. 
      OUTCOMES: The use of MBSR and HEP as the active comparison to treat UUI in older 
      adult women proved feasible in this trial. [ Research in Gerontological Nursing,

      Disorder and Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms: a Pilot Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2754-2766
LID - 10.1007/s12671-021-01739-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A substantial proportion of trauma survivors with posttraumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) continue to experience symptoms 
      even after trauma-focused therapies. Internet-based interventions could 
      facilitate access to treatment for PTSD and CPTSD. The current pilot study aimed 
      to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based internet intervention on PTSD and 
      CPTSD symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with two 
      measurement points (pre-test and post-test) was used to investigate the effects 
      of a structured mindfulness-based internet intervention on PTSD and CPTSD 
      symptoms as well as anxiety, depression, and positive mental health. In total, 70 
      university students with high levels of PTSD and CPTSD symptoms based on ICD-11 
      criteria participated in the study: 31 in the intervention group and 39 in the 
      waiting list control group. RESULTS: We found that the mindfulness-based internet 
      intervention reduced CPTSD disturbances in self-organization (DSO) symptoms (ES = 
      - 0.48 [- 0.96; 0.00]), particularly negative self-concept (ES = - 0.72 [- 1.21; 
      - 0.24]) and disturbances in relationships (ES = - 0.55 [- 1.03; - 0.07]). 
      Moreover, the intervention reduced the symptoms of PTSD sense of threat (ES = - 
      0.48 [- 0.96; - 0.01]) and promoted positive mental health (ES = 0.51 [0.03; 
      0.99]). High user satisfaction and good usability of the intervention were 
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: Promising treatment effects were found, indicating that 
      mindfulness-based internet intervention can reduce CPTSD symptoms and have a 
      positive effect on mental health among youth in general. The findings of the 
      current study contribute to the further development of trauma care using 
      internet-delivered interventions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Resilience@Work Mindfulness Program: Results From a Cluster Randomized Controlled 
      Trial With First Responders.
PG  - e12894

AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of research suggests that resilience training can play 
      a pivotal role in creating mentally healthy workplaces, particularly with regard 
      to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. Emerging research describes 
      positive outcomes from various types of resilience training programs (RTPs) among 
      different occupational groups. One specific group of workers that may benefit 
      from this form of proactive resilience training is first responders. Given the 
      nature of their work, first responders are frequently exposed to stressful 
      circumstances and potentially traumatic events, which may impact their overall 
      resilience and well-being over time. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine 
      whether a mindfulness-based RTP (the Resilience@Work [RAW] Mindfulness Program) 
      delivered via the internet can effectively enhance resilience among a group of 
      high-risk workers. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) comprising 24 Primary Fire and Rescue and Hazmat stations within New South 
      Wales. Overall, 12 stations were assigned to the 6-session RAW Mindfulness 
      Program and 12 stations were assigned to the control condition. A total of 143 
      active full-time firefighters enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were 
      administered at baseline, immediately post training, and at 6-month follow-up. 
      Measurements examined change in both adaptive and bounce-back resilience as well 
      as several secondary outcomes examining resilience resources and acceptance and 
      mindfulness skills. RESULTS: Mixed-model repeated measures analysis found that 
      the overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P=.008), with the 
      intervention group increasing in adaptive resilience over time. However, no 
      significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control 
      group in terms of change in bounce-back resilience (P=.09). At 6-month follow-up, 
      the group receiving the RAW intervention had an average increase in their 
      resilience score of 1.3, equating to a moderate-to-large effect size compared 
      with the control group of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38-1.06). Per-protocol analysis found 
      that compared with the control group, the greatest improvements in adaptive 
      resilience were observed among those who completed most of the RAW program, that 
      is, 5 to 6 sessions (P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this RCT suggest that 
      mindfulness-based resilience training delivered in an internet format can create 
      improvements in adaptive resilience and related resources among high-risk 
      workers, such as first responders. Despite a number of limitations, the results 
      of this study suggest that the RAW Mindfulness Program is an effective, scalable, 
      and practical means of delivering online resilience training in high-risk 
      workplace settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a 
      mindfulness-based RTP delivered entirely via the internet has been tested in the 
      workplace. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

TI  - Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement remediates anhedonia in chronic opioid 
      use by enhancing neurophysiological responses during savoring of natural rewards.
PG  - 2085-2094
LID - 10.1017/S0033291721003834 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropsychopharmacologic effects of long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) 
      in the context of chronic pain may result in subjective anhedonia coupled with 
      decreased attention to natural rewards. Yet, there are no known efficacious 
      treatments for anhedonia and reward deficits associated with chronic opioid use. 
      Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a novel behavioral intervention 
      combining training in mindfulness with savoring of natural rewards, may hold 
      promise for treating anhedonia in LTOT. METHODS: Veterans receiving LTOT (N = 63) 
      for chronic pain were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or a supportive group (SG) 
      psychotherapy control. Before and after the 8-week treatment groups, we assessed 
      the effects of MORE on the late positive potential (LPP) of the 
      electroencephalogram and skin conductance level (SCL) during viewing and 
      up-regulating responses (i.e. savoring) to natural reward cues. We then examined 
      whether these neurophysiological effects were associated with reductions in 
      subjective anhedonia by 4-month follow-up. RESULTS: Patients treated with MORE 
      demonstrated significantly increased LPP and SCL to natural reward cues and 
      greater decreases in subjective anhedonia relative to those in the SG. The effect 
      of MORE on reducing anhedonia was statistically mediated by increases in LPP 
      response during savoring. CONCLUSIONS: MORE enhances motivated attention to 
      natural reward cues among chronic pain patients on LTOT, as evidenced by 
      increased electrocortical and sympathetic nervous system responses. Given 
      neurophysiological evidence of clinical target engagement, MORE may be an 
      efficacious treatment for anhedonia among chronic opioid users, people with 
      chronic pain, and those at risk for opioid use disorder.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on psychological 
      well-being and quality of life: is increased mindfulness indeed the mechanism?
PG  - 331-40
LID - 10.1007/s12160-008-9030-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have reported positive effects of 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention on psychological 
      well-being, it is not known whether these effects are attributable to a change in 
      mindfulness. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the effects of MBSR to 
      a waiting-list control condition in a randomized controlled trial while examining 
      potentially mediating effects of mindfulness. METHODS: Forty women and 20 men 
      from the community with symptoms of distress (mean age 43.6 years, SD = 10.1) 
      were randomized into a group receiving MBSR or a waiting-list control group. 
      Before and after the intervention period, questionnaires were completed on 
      psychological well-being, quality of life, and mindfulness. RESULTS: Repeated 
      measures multiple analysis of variance (MANCOVAs) showed that, compared with the 
      control group, the intervention resulted in significantly stronger reductions of 
      perceived stress (p = 0.016) and vital exhaustion (p = 0.001) and stronger 
      elevations of positive affect (p = 0.006), quality of life (p = .009), as well as 
      mindfulness (p = 0.001). When mindfulness was included as a covariate in the 
      MANCOVA, the group effects on perceived stress and quality of life were reduced 
      to nonsignificance. CONCLUSION: Increased mindfulness may, at least partially, 
      mediate the positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention.

TI  - Examining the effects of mindfulness-based yoga instruction on positive 
      embodiment and affective responses.
PG  - 458-475
LID - 10.1080/10640266.2020.1738909 [doi]
AB  - Empirical evidence provides support for the inclusion of yoga as part of eating 
      disorder prevention efforts through its positive impact on positive embodiment 
      and experience of positive core affect. However, there is a need to identify the 
      specific instructional strategies that will more consistently support positive 
      embodiment and positive affect. We examined the effect of teaching a single yoga 
      class using mindfulness-based instruction compared to appearance-based and 
      neutral instruction alternatives on embodiment (i.e., state body surveillance, 
      state body appreciation, pleasure during yoga) and changes in affect from before 
      to after class. Female participants (N = 62; M (age) = 23.89, SD = 6.86) were 
      randomly assigned to a yoga class that emphasized: being mindfully present in 
      one's body, changing one's appearance, or just getting into yoga poses. ANOVAs 
      revealed significantly higher body surveillance (η(p) (2) =.10) and lower 
      forecasted pleasure (η(p) (2) =.21) in the appearance class compared to the other 
      two classes. Participants in the mindfulness class experienced greater 
      improvement in affect (η(p) (2) =.08) from before to after class and higher 
      remembered pleasure during the yoga class (η(p) (2) =.19) compared to those in 
      the appearance class. Emphasizing changes to appearance in yoga instruction may 
      place participants at risk for less positive affect and less positive experiences 
      of embodiment compared to mindfulness-based or even neutral yoga instruction.

TI  - Upper secondary school students' compliance with two Internet-based self-help 
      programmes: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 191-200
LID - 10.1007/s00787-017-1035-6 [doi]
AB  - Psychiatric symptoms and stress are on the increase among Swedish adolescents. We 
      aimed to study the potential effect and feasibility of two Internet-based 
      self-help programmes, one mindfulness based (iMBI) and the other music based in a 
      randomised controlled trial that targeted adolescents. A total of 283 upper 
      secondary school students in two Swedish schools were randomised to either a 
      waiting list or one of the two programmes, on their own incentive, on schooltime. 
      General psychiatric health (Symptoms Checklist 90), sleep quality (Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Quality Index), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were assessed 
      before and after the interventions. In total, 202 participants answered the 
      questionnaires. Less than 20 logged into each intervention and only 1 performed a 
      full intervention (iMBI). No significant differences in any of the scales were 
      found between those who logged in and those who did not. The potential effect of 
      Internet-based self-help programmes was not possible to examine due to low 
      compliance rates. Adolescents seem to have a very low compliance with 
      Internet-based self-help programmes if left to their own incentive. There were no 
      associations between the psychiatric and stress-related symptoms at baseline and 
      compliance in any of the intervention groups, and no evidence for differences in 
      compliance in relation to the type of programme. Additional studies are needed to 
      examine how compliance rates can be increased in Internet-based self-help 
      mindfulness programmes in adolescents, as the potentially positive effects of 
      mindfulness are partly related to compliance rates.

TI  - Comparison of the Effect of Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mindfulness Based 
      Cognitive Therapy and Positive Psychotherapy on Perceived Stress and Quality of 
      Life in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a Pilot Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - 565-578
LID - 10.1007/s11126-019-09643-2 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to compare dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness based 
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) and positive psychotherapy (PPT) effects on perceived 
      stress (PS) and quality of life (QOL) among patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). Seventy six eligible patients with a Rome- IV diagnosis were 
      randomly allocated in DBT (n = 18), MBCT (n = 20), PPT (n = 18), and control 
      groups (n = 20). All the patients were evaluated for PS by perceived stress scale 
      (PSS) and QOL by irritable bowel syndrome quality of life (IBS-QOL) on the 
      studied groups at the time of their inclusion in the study and 8 weeks after it. 
      Each of the intervention groups took part in 8 group sessions. Conversely, the 
      control group were evaluated without any intervention. 46 female and 27 male in 4 
      groups completed the study. The results showed significant differences between 
      the groups based on the variables of the PSS and IBS-QOL (p < 0.05). In addition, 
      levels of PS were significantly lower for the MBCT intervention compared with the 
      other groups; besides, the significant effects of the QOL variables represented 
      the higher scores of the PPT compared to the treatment groups. The interventions 
      could not be generalized to other samples. Some other limitations included the 
      lack of conducting a follow-up plan. This study provides initial evidence that 
      MBCT and PPT are more effective than other treatment groups on PS decrease and 
      QOL improvement among patients with IBS, respectively.

TI  - Nurses' experiences, expectations, and preferences for mind-body practices to 
      reduce stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most research on the impact of mind-body training does not ask about 
      participants' baseline experience, expectations, or preferences for training. To 
      better plan participant-centered mind-body intervention trials for nurses to 
      reduce occupational stress, such descriptive information would be valuable. 
      METHODS: We conducted an anonymous email survey between April and June, 2010 of 
      North American nurses interested in mind-body training to reduce stress. The 
      e-survey included: demographic characteristics, health conditions and stress 
      levels; experiences with mind-body practices; expected health benefits; training 
      preferences; and willingness to participate in future randomized controlled 
      trials. RESULTS: Of the 342 respondents, 96% were women and 92% were Caucasian. 
      Most (73%) reported one or more health conditions, notably anxiety (49%); back 
      pain (41%); GI problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (34%); or depression 
      (33%). Their median occupational stress level was 4 (0 = none; 5 = extreme 
      stress). Nearly all (99%) reported already using one or more mind-body practices 
      to reduce stress: intercessory prayer (86%), breath-focused meditation (49%), 
      healing or therapeutic touch (39%), yoga/tai chi/qi gong (34%), or 
      mindfulness-based meditation (18%). The greatest expected benefits were for 
      greater spiritual well-being (56%); serenity, calm, or inner peace (54%); better 
      mood (51%); more compassion (50%); or better sleep (42%). Most (65%) wanted 
      additional training; convenience (74% essential or very important), was more 
      important than the program's reputation (49%) or scientific evidence about 
      effectiveness (32%) in program selection. Most (65%) were willing to participate 
      in a randomized trial of mind-body training; among these, most were willing to 
      collect salivary cortisol (60%), or serum biomarkers (53%) to assess the impact 
      of training. CONCLUSIONS: Most nurses interested in mind-body training already 
      engage in such practices. They have greater expectations about spiritual and 
      emotional than physical benefits, but are willing to participate in studies and 
      to collect biomarker data. Recruitment may depend more on convenience than a 
      program's scientific basis or reputation. Knowledge of participants' baseline 
      experiences, expectations, and preferences helps inform future training and 
      research on mind-body approaches to reduce stress.

TI  - Effects of a 12-Minute Smartphone-Based Mindful Breathing Task on Heart Rate 
      Variability for Students With Clinically Relevant Chronic Pain, Depression, and 
      Anxiety: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e14119
LID - 10.2196/14119 [doi]
LID - e14119
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a commonly used psychological 
      intervention for pain, mood, and anxiety conditions, but can be challenging to 
      practice with severe symptoms without proper training. The Mindfulness Meditation 
      app (MMA) is a supportive training tool specifically developed for this study to 
      aid in the practice of mindful breathing using a smartphone. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aims to evaluate the psychophysiological effects of the MMA. Specifically, 
      the study will assess parasympathetic functioning using heart rate variability 
      (HRV; primary outcome), pain and mood symptoms, mind-wandering and present moment 
      awareness, and breath focus in groups of undergraduate participants who 
      self-report clinically-relevant symptoms of chronic pain (CP) and depression or 
      anxiety (DA) and condition-free (CF) participants who do not meet either 
      criteria. We hypothesize that use of the MMA by study groups will lead to 
      improved HRV, pain, and mood symptoms compared with groups who do not use the 
      app. METHODS: This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
      recruiting through a Web-based research participation pool at York University in 
      Toronto, Canada. We are aiming for minimum 60 participants in each of CP, DA, and 
      CF groups. Upon arriving to the laboratory, participants will be prescreened for 
      classification into groups of CP, DA, or CF. Groups will be randomly assigned by 
      a 1:1 ratio to an MMA (MMA+) condition or MM condition without the app (MMA-) 
      after a brief stress induction procedure. In MMA+, participants will practice 
      mindful breathing with a smartphone and press breath or other buttons at the 
      sound of audio tones if their awareness was on breathing or another experience, 
      respectively. HRV and respiration data will be obtained during rest (5 min), 
      stress induction (5 min), and meditation conditions (12 min). Participants will 
      complete psychological self-report inventories before and after the stress 
      induction and after the meditation condition. Separate linear mixed models will 
      be used to examine HRV and self-report inventories comparing groups and treatment 
      conditions. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in November 2017 and is 
      expected to be completed in winter of 2019-2020. As of July 2019, 189 
      participants have been recruited. The study's main findings are expected to 
      reveal a positive pattern of HRV responses in the CP, DA, and CF groups, such 
      that a significant increase in HRV (P<.05) is detected in those randomized to the 
      MMA+ condition in comparison with those randomized to the MMA- condition. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This RCT will contribute to the burgeoning health psychology 
      literature regarding the clinical relevance of HRV in assessment and treatment of 
      psychological and medical conditions. Furthermore, possible ways to inform 
      designs of MM training tools delivered by apps and Web platforms for CP, 
      depression, and anxiety conditions' treatment will be discussed. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing integration of digital technologies into daily life 
      has spurred a growing body of research in the field of digital psychology. This 
      research has shed light on the potential benefits and drawbacks of digital 
      technologies for mental health and well-being. However, the intricate 
      relationship between technology and psychology remains largely unexplored. 
      PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based mobile 
      apps on university students' anxiety, loneliness, and well-being. Additionally, 
      it sought to explore participants' perceptions of the addictiveness of these 
      apps. METHOD: The research utilized a multi-phase approach, encompassing a 
      correlational research method, a pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial, 
      and a qualitative case study. Participants were segmented into three subsets: 
      correlations (n = 300), treatment (n = 60), and qualitative (n = 20). Data were 
      gathered from various sources, including the social anxiety scale, well-being 
      scale, social media use integration scale, and an interview checklist. 
      Quantitative data was analyzed using Pearson correlation, multiple regression, 
      and t-tests, while qualitative data underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 
      study uncovered a significant correlation between social media use and the 
      variables under investigation. Moreover, the treatment involving 
      mindfulness-based mobile apps led to a reduction in students' anxiety and an 
      enhancement of their well-being. Notably, participants held various positive 
      perceptions regarding the use of these apps. IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this 
      research hold both theoretical and practical significance for the field of 
      digital psychology. They provide insight into the potential of mindfulness-based 
      mobile apps to positively impact university students' mental health and 
      well-being. Additionally, the study underscores the need for further exploration 
      of the intricate dynamics between technology and psychology in an increasingly 
      digital world.

TI  - An e-mental health intervention to reduce depression symptoms in individuals with 
      obesity: study protocol for the randomized, controlled, two-armed, confirmatory 
      LightMood trial.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.1186/s13063-024-07970-9 [doi]
LID - 149
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with obesity often experience psychological distress, 
      specifically depression symptoms. Due to various barriers, such as limitations of 
      healthcare offers, digital interventions, for example medical apps, can provide a 
      suitable approach to support affected people. In the envisaged prospective 
      randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the efficacy of the LightMood 
      intervention. The LightMood intervention is a manualized and user-centered, 
      digital intervention for patients with obesity, with a duration of 4 months, 
      which contains elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based and 
      skills-based exercises. We expect the LightMood intervention to be superior to 
      treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of reducing depression symptoms. METHODS: The 
      trial incorporates four distinct measurement time points: the baseline 
      assessment, the post-treatment assessment, and 1- and 3-month follow-up 
      assessments. Furthermore, we implemented in-treatment assessments for both 
      groups. Participants will be randomized into two groups (LightMood intervention 
      vs TAU). The aim is to include 128 participants (64 per group) in the study. 
      Inclusion criteria are patients who are obese, at least 18 years old, with a 
      private Internet access, and with adequate digital literacy and show depression 
      symptoms (PHQ ≥ 10). Exclusion criteria are weekly outpatient individual 
      psychotherapy, obesity surgery within the last year or planned within the next 7 
      months, no private Internet access, and the prescription of a new psychotropic 
      drug within the last 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the post-assessment 
      reduction in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include the improvement 
      in self-efficacy, quality of life, mindfulness, reduction in eating disorder 
      symptoms, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we expect a positive 
      development of depression symptoms throughout the different time points (T1, T2, 
      and T3) in patients with obesity. DISCUSSION: LightMood is an evidence-based, 
      efficient, low-threshold online intervention that aims to reduce depression 
      symptoms in people with obesity. Online interventions could offer a promising 
      alternative to conventional face-to-face therapy. The primary objective of the 
      current study is to add essential insight into the feasibility, efficacy, 
      effectiveness, and acceptance of e-mental health interventions for people with 
      obesity and depression symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trial

TI  - Effect of an Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention on 
      Postpandemic Era Nurses' Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological 
      Adaptation.

AB  - This study explores the effects of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      intervention on postpandemic era nurses' subjective well-being, job burnout, and 
      psychological adaptation. Previous studies on the psychological adaptability of 
      nurses mainly focused on investigation rather than intervention. Ninety nurses 
      were randomly classified into an intervention or control group. The intervention 
      group received weekly online mindfulness-based stress reduction training for 8 
      weeks. The Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological Use scales were 
      administered pre- and postintervention. Postintervention, nurses' positive 
      emotions and life satisfaction significantly improved. Nurses' psychological 
      adaptation was significantly higher postintervention than preintervention. The 
      total scores for negative emotion, low personal accomplishment, and job burnout 
      were significantly lower postintervention than preintervention. The scores for 
      positive emotion and life satisfaction in the intervention group were 
      significantly higher than those in the control group, and the scores for low 
      personal accomplishment in the intervention group were significantly lower than 
      those in the control group. Online mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      interventions can improve nurses' subjective well-being, reduce job burnout, and 
      improve their level of psychological adaptability. Moreover, it could promote 
      nurses' ability to communicate mindfully with patients and their families. This 
      intervention could help promote the development of mindfulness in the nursing 
      field.

AB  - Research shows that depression and anxiety disorders are the most common 
      psychiatric concern in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mindfulness-based therapy 
      (MBT) has been found effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, 
      however research in autism is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of a 
      modified MBT protocol (MBT-AS) in high-functioning adults with ASD. 42 
      participants were randomized into a 9-week MBT-AS training or a wait-list control 
      group. Results showed a significant reduction in depression, anxiety and 
      rumination in the intervention group, as opposed to the control group. 
      Furthermore, positive affect increased in the intervention group, but not in the 
      control group. Concluding, the present study is the first controlled trial to 
      demonstrate that adults with ASD can benefit from MBT-AS.

TI  - Effectiveness of Mindfulness Meditation vs Headache Education for Adults With 
      Migraine: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 317-328
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.7090 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Most 
      patients with migraine discontinue medications due to inefficacy or adverse 
      effects. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) may provide benefit. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine if MBSR improves migraine outcomes and 
      affective/cognitive processes compared with headache education. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial of MBSR vs headache education 
      included 89 adults who experienced between 4 and 20 migraine days per month. 
      There was blinding of participants (to active vs comparator group assignments) 
      and principal investigators/data analysts (to group assignment). INTERVENTIONS: 
      Participants underwent MBSR (standardized training in mindfulness/yoga) or 
      headache education (migraine information) delivered in groups that met for 2 
      hours each week for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 
      change in migraine day frequency (baseline to 12 weeks). Secondary outcomes were 
      changes in disability, quality of life, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, 
      depression scores, and experimentally induced pain intensity and unpleasantness 
      (baseline to 12, 24, and 36 weeks). RESULTS: Most participants were female 
      (n = 82, 92%), with a mean (SD) age of 43.9 (13.0) years, and had a mean (SD) of 
      7.3 (2.7) migraine days per month and high disability (Headache Impact Test-6: 
      63.5 [5.7]), attended class (median attendance, 7 of 8 classes), and followed up 
      through 36 weeks (33 of 45 [73%] of the MBSR group and 32 of 44 [73%] of the 
      headache education group). Participants in both groups had fewer migraine days at 
      12 weeks (MBSR: -1.6 migraine days per month; 95% CI, -0.7 to -2.5; headache 
      education: -2.0 migraine days per month; 95% CI, -1.1 to -2.9), without group 
      differences (P = .50). Compared with those who participated in headache 
      education, those who participated in MBSR had improvements from baseline at all 
      follow-up time points (reported in terms of point estimates of effect differences 
      between groups) on measures of disability (5.92; 95% CI, 2.8-9.0; P < .001), 
      quality of life (5.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.9; P = .01), self-efficacy (8.2; 95% CI, 
      0.3-16.1; P = .04), pain catastrophizing (5.8; 95% CI, 2.9-8.8; P < .001), 
      depression scores (1.6; 95% CI, 0.4-2.7; P = .008), and decreased experimentally 
      induced pain intensity and unpleasantness (MBSR group: 36.3% [95% CI, 12.3% to 
      60.3%] decrease in intensity and 30.4% [95% CI, 9.9% to 49.4%] decrease in 
      unpleasantness; headache education group: 13.5% [95% CI, -9.9% to 36.8%] increase 
      in intensity and an 11.2% [95% CI, -8.9% to 31.2%] increase in unpleasantness; 
      P = .004 for intensity and .005 for unpleasantness, at 36 weeks). One reported 
      adverse event was deemed unrelated to study protocol. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction did not improve migraine frequency more than 
      headache education, as both groups had similar decreases; however, MBSR improved 
      disability, quality of life, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, and depression 
      out to 36 weeks, with decreased experimentally induced pain suggesting a 
      potential shift in pain appraisal. In conclusion, MBSR may help treat total 
      migraine burden, but a larger, more definitive study is needed to further 
      investigate these results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study tested the acceptability and efficacy of an Acceptance and 
      Commitment Therapy and compassion-based intervention (LIFEwithIBD) in people with 
      IBD through a two-arm RCT. METHODS: Participants were recruited at the 
      Gastroenterology Department of the Coimbra University Hospital between June and 
      September 2019. Of the 355 patients screened, those who accepted to participate 
      were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: experimental group (LIFEwithIBD; 
      n = 25) or control group (waitlist; n = 29). Participants completed self-report 
      measures at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-month (T2) and 12-month 
      (T3) follow-ups. Intervention acceptability was assessed. Efficacy was examined 
      using intent-to-treat ANCOVA at post-intervention after adjusting for baseline 
      values of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms (primary outcomes). Linear 
      mixed models for all longitudinal outcomes were also analysed. Inflammatory and 
      disease biomarkers were determined at T0 and T3. RESULTS: Acceptability results 
      revealed a high level of satisfaction and perceived usefulness regarding the 
      intervention. Both groups experienced a significant decrease in stress symptoms 
      and IBD symptom perception at T1. No significant differences were observed at 
      follow-up for the primary outcomes. The experimental group reported significantly 
      lower Crohn's disease Symptom severity at T2 than the control group. Post-hoc 
      analyses designed to mitigate floor effects revealed substantial treatment 
      effects for the experimental group regarding anxiety symptoms. No significant 
      differences were observed in clinical biomarkers from T0 to T3. CONCLUSION: The 
      LIFEwithIBD intervention shows promising, although preliminary, benefits for 
      managing disease activity and reducing anxiety symptoms in IBD patients with high 
      severity of psychological distress.Clinical trial registration:

TI  - Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate in 
      adults with self-reported stress. A randomized trial.
PG  - 2360-2369
LID - 10.1111/cts.13100 [doi]
AB  - Long-term stress can lead to long-term increased cortisol plasma levels, which 
      increases the risk of numerous diseases. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its 
      sulfated form dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), together DHEA(S), have 
      shown to counteract some of the effects of cortisol and may be protective during 
      stress. The program "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction" (MBSR) has shown to have 
      positive effects on stress. The present study examined a possible effect of MBSR 
      on DHEAS in plasma compared to a waiting list and a locally developed stress 
      reduction program (LSR) in people with self-reported stress. The study was a 
      three-armed randomized controlled trial conducted in a municipal health care 
      center in Denmark. It included 71 participants with self-reported stress 
      randomized to either MBSR (n = 24) or LSR (n = 23), or a waiting list (n = 24). 
      Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks follow-up to estimate 
      effects of MBSR on DHEAS. The effect of MBSR on DHEAS was statistically 
      significant compared to both the waiting list and LSR. We found a mean effect of 
      0.70 µmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18-1.22) higher DHEAS in the MBSR 
      group compared with the waiting list group and a mean effect of 0.54 µmol/L (95% 
      CI = 0.04-1.05) higher DHEAS in the MBSR group compared with the LSR group. 
      Findings indicate an effect on DHEAS of the MBSR program compared to a waiting 
      list and LSR program in people with self-reported stress. However, we consider 
      our findings hypothesis-generating and validation by future studies is essential.

TI  - Meditation or Medication? Mindfulness training versus medication in the treatment 
      of childhood ADHD: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 267
LID - 10.1186/s12888-016-0978-3 [doi]
LID - 267
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder (ADHD) is, with a prevalence 
      of 5 %, a highly common childhood disorder, and has severe impact on the lives of 
      youngsters and their families. Medication is often the treatment of choice, as it 
      currently is most effective. However, medication has only short-term effects, 
      treatment adherence is often low and most importantly; medication has serious 
      side effects. Therefore, there is a need for other interventions for youngsters 
      with ADHD. Mindfulness training is emerging as a potentially effective training 
      for children and adolescents with ADHD. The aim of this study is to compare the 
      (cost) effectiveness of mindfulness training to the (cost) effectiveness of 
      methylphenidate in children with ADHD on measures of attention and 
      hyperactivity/impulsivity. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter randomized controlled 
      trial with 2 follow-up measurements will be used to measure the effects of 
      mindfulness training versus the effects of methylphenidate. Participants will be 
      youngsters (aged 9 to 18) of both sexes diagnosed with ADHD, referred to urban 
      and rural mental healthcare centers. We aim to include 120 families. The 
      mindfulness training, using the MYmind protocol, will be conducted in small 
      groups, and consists of 8 weekly 1.5-h sessions. Youngsters learn to focus and 
      enhance their attention, awareness, and self-control by doing mindfulness 
      exercises. Parents will follow a parallel mindful parenting training in which 
      they learn to be fully present in the here and now with their child in a 
      non-judgmental way, to take care of themselves, and to respond rather than react 
      to difficult behavior of their child. Short-acting methylphenidate will be 
      administered individually and monitored by a child psychiatrist. Assessments will 
      take place at pre-test, post-test, and at follow-up 1 and 2 (respectively 4 and 
      10 months after the start of treatment). Informants are parents, children, 
      teachers, and researchers. DISCUSSION: This study will inform mental health care 
      professionals and health insurance companies about the clinical and cost 
      effectiveness of mindfulness training for children and adolescents with ADHD and 
      their parents compared to the effectiveness of methylphenidate. Limitations and 
      several types of bias that are anticipated for this study are discussed. TRIAL

TI  - The Effects of a Modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program for Nurses: 
      A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 111-122
LID - 10.1177/2165079918801633 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of a modified 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on the levels of stress, 
      affect, and resilience among nurses in general hospitals in mainland China. In 
      addition, the study attempted to determine the impact of the program on job 
      satisfaction. A total of 110 nurses were randomly assigned to the intervention 
      versus control groups. The intervention group participated in a modified 8-week 
      MBSR program. All participants were evaluated with questionnaires at baseline, 
      immediately after the intervention, and 3 months later. The intervention group 
      showed decreases in stress and negative affect and increases in positive affect 
      and resilience after the intervention. No improvement in job satisfaction was 
      observed, but the trends of the data were in the hypothesized direction that job 
      satisfaction would improve. The modified MBSR program is an effective approach 
      for nurses to decrease stress and negative affect and improve positive affect and 
      resilience. In addition, the program has the potential to improve job 
      satisfaction.

TI  - Asian Women's Action for Resilience and Empowerment Intervention: Stage I Pilot 
      Study.
PG  - 1537-1553
LID - 10.1177/0022022117730815 [doi]
AB  - This study describes the development and pilot test of Asian Women's Action for 
      Resilience and Empowerment (AWARE), a culturally informed group psychotherapy 
      intervention designed to reduce depressive symptoms, suicidality, substance use, 
      and HIV and sexual risk behaviors among 1.5 and second generation Asian American 
      (AA) women. To participate, AA women had to meet the criteria for posttraumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) or have a history of exposure to interpersonal violence 
      (IPV) as determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and 
      Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ). This article also presents the 
      preliminary feasibility and acceptability of AWARE from its Stage I pilot study 
      of nine Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese American women. To foster holistic 
      treatment, AWARE was developed based on original research findings from Stage 0 
      and integrated theoretical models including fractured identity theory, 
      empowerment theory, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based 
      techniques, and the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM). The development of AWARE 
      was an iterative process informed by participant feedback, which led to frequent 
      intervention modifications for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 
      Stage II. A qualitative analysis of participant feedback informed the following 
      modifications: further exploration of feelings, improvements in technology 
      delivery, learning and practicing coping skills, more specific cultural tailoring 
      related to sexual health, decreased number of sessions and increased time per 
      session. Findings provide support for the acceptability and feasibility of AWARE 
      as "culturally informed" for AA young women with IPV histories, high-risk 
      behaviors, and mental health issues.

AB  - Prevalence rates of peripartum depression and anxiety are high and correlate with 
      adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) 
      have been shown to reduce mental distress during pregnancy. A multicenter, 
      randomized controlled study was conducted after screening for depressive 
      symptoms. The intervention group (IG) was given access to an 8-week supervised 
      eMBI between weeks 29 and 36 of pregnancy and followed up to 5 months postpartum. 
      Psychometric data were collected using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
      (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety 
      Questionnaire (PRAQ-R), the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI-14) as well as 
      the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Out of 5299 pregnant women, 1153 scored 
      >9 on the EPDS and N = 460 were included in the RCT. No significant interaction 
      effects for depressive symptoms and anxiety were found. Pregnancy- and 
      birth-related anxiety decreased significantly in the IG and 6 weeks after birth, 
      the rate of women at risk for adverse mental outcome was significantly lower 
      compared to the CG. Mindfulness scores improved significantly in the IG. The eMBI 
      program did not show effective regarding general depressive or anxiety symptoms, 
      however, positive results were demonstrated regarding pregnancy and birth-related 
      anxiety and the prevention of postpartum depression.

TI  - Comparing impacts of meditation training in focused attention, open monitoring, 
      and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on emotion reactivity and regulation: 
      Neural and subjective evidence from a dismantling study.

AB  - Commonly conducted mindfulness-based trainings such as Mindfulness-based Stress 
      Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) highlight 
      training in two key forms of meditation: focused attention (FA) and open 
      monitoring (OM). Largely unknown is what each of these mindfulness practices 
      contributes to emotional and other important training outcomes. This dismantling 
      trial compared the effects of structurally equivalent trainings in MBCT, FA, and 
      OM on neural and subjective markers of emotional reactivity and regulation among 
      community adults, with the aim to better understand which forms of training 
      represent active ingredients in mindfulness trainings. Participants with varying 
      levels of depressive symptoms were randomized to one of the three trainings. 
      Before and after each 8-week training, N = 89 participants completed a modified 
      version of the Emotional Reactivity and Regulation Task while 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) and self-reported emotional responses to negative, 
      positive, and neutral photographic images were collected. Examination of 
      EEG-based frontal alpha band asymmetry during passive viewing (reactivity) and 
      active regulation phases of the task showed that FA and MBCT trainings produced 
      significant leftward hemispheric shifts in frontal alpha asymmetry, commonly 
      associated with a shift toward approach-based positive affect. Self-reported 
      emotional responses to negative images corroborated these results, suggesting 
      salutary changes in both emotional reactivity and regulation. OM training had 
      limited beneficial effects, restricted to the subjective outcomes. The findings 
      suggest that MBCT may derive its greatest benefit from training in FA rather than 
      OM. Discussion highlights the potential value of FA training for emotional 
      health.

AB  - This article reports qualitative outcomes from a randomized controlled trial 
      comparing eight weeks of cognitive-behavioral group therapy for chronic pain 
      (CBT-CP) and mindfulness-based group therapy (MBT) in individuals with chronic 
      low back pain (CLBP). Approximately 10 months post-treatment, 108 participants 
      completed structured qualitative interviews to express how the study treatment 
      affected their life or health. Responses were qualitatively analyzed to generate 
      a set of themes and subthemes, with between-groups comparisons to evaluate 
      differences (if any) in treatment-response between MBT and CBT-CP. A majority of 
      participants (n = 88, 81.5%) across both groups reflected positively on the study 
      intervention and outcomes, identifying benefits in pain management (31.5%), 
      meditation and mindfulness skills (25.9%), and relaxation skills (22.2%). 
      Perceived benefits varied widely, suggesting no one intervention may be ideal for 
      CLBP. Future research should examine tailoring interventions to target diverse 
      clinical presentations to achieve optimal outcomes.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on 
      posttraumatic growth of Chinese breast cancer survivors.
PG  - 94-109
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) patients in China suffered from a variety of psychology stress 
      such as perceived stress and anxiety, posttraumatic growth (PTG) as a positive 
      factor could promote their psychology health and quality of life. This study 
      aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on 
      promoting PTG, decreasing perceived stress and anxiety of Chinese BC patients. A 
      randomized controlled trial of 60 BC patients (Stages I-III) was conducted. They 
      were randomly divided to the 8-week MBSR group or usual care (UC) group. PTG 
      inventory, Perceived Stress Scale of Chinese version (CPSS) and State Trait 
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI) evaluated the PTG level, perceived stress and anxiety at 
      three times(before intervention-T1, after intervention-T2 and follow up at 
      3 months-T3). A repeated-measures analysis of variance model was used to compare 
      each outcome measure of two groups at the three times. There was one patient 
      discontinued the intervention and one lose to follow up in MBSR group, finally 58 
      BC patients completed the research. There was no difference between two groups 
      before the intervention. The results showed significant improvements in MBSR 
      group comparing with the UC group that PTG level was much higher after the 8-week 
      intervention and the follow up (F = 34.73, p < .00). At the same time, CPSS 
      (F = 14.41, p < .00) and STAI (F = 15.24, p < .00) scores were significant 
      decreased at T2 and T3. The results showed that MBSR promoted the level of PTG 
      and decreased perceived stress and anxiety state of Chinese BC patients, and the 
      results persisted at three months after intervention. The research preliminary 
      proved that MBSR was suitable to Chinese BC patients. MBSR should be recommending 
      to BC survivors in China.

TI  - The effect of online multimedia psychoeducational interventions on the resilience 
      and perceived stress of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pilot cluster 
      randomized parallel-controlled trial.
PG  - 93

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence suggesting that quarantine might have undesirable 
      psychological impacts on the patients. Therefore, it is important to seek for 
      ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the 
      patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study 
      was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention 
      regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on 
      resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. 
      METHOD: This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with 
      hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online 
      trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in 
      Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the 
      intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly 
      assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants 
      in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia 
      psychoeducational interventions during the 2 weeks, whilst the patients in the 
      wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive 
      telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational 
      interventions mainly included cognitive-behavioural techniques, stress management 
      techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The 
      patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and 
      after two weeks. RESULTS: Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational 
      interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence 
      (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean = 29.42; SD = 4.18) with the online multimedia 
      psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the 
      patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported 
      greater resilience (Mean(intervention) = 81.74; Mean(control) = 72.86; adjusted t 
      (46) = 2.10; p = 0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2 = 0.83) and fewer perceived 
      stress (Mean(intervention) = 22.15; Mean(control) = 29.45; adjusted t 
      (46) = 2.66; p = 0.01; CI: - 12.81 to - 1.78; dppc2 = - 0.77) after 2 weeks. 
      DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt 
      at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to 
      promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized 
      due to infection with COVID-19. The present results could help mental health 
      professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to 
      promote patients' resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease. TRIAL

TI  - A WeChat-based self-compassion training to improve the treatment adherence of 
      patients with schizophrenia in China: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 931802
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.931802 [doi]
LID - 931802
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, adherence to antipsychotic treatment is often poor, 
      leading to the recurrence of symptoms. This increases the likelihood of the 
      patient experiencing disability and thus increases the disease burden for the 
      patient, their family, and society as a whole. However, to date, there is no 
      clear evidence regarding the effect of medication adherence interventions on 
      outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, the traditional intervention 
      methods are limited by manpower and resources in low- and middle-income 
      countries. Recent studies have demonstrated that increasing a patient's level of 
      self-compassion may improve their treatment adherence. Online mental health care 
      interventions have advantages in terms of feasibility and acceptability for 
      patients with schizophrenia. In this regard, a WeChat-based self-compassion 
      training protocol to improve patient treatment adherence was designed in this 
      study and will be evaluated in the future to determine its impact on patients 
      with schizophrenia. METHODS: The protocol for the randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) is based on the SPIRIT 2013 statement. This parallel RCT will aim to 
      recruit 392 patients with schizophrenia who will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio 
      into a 3-week intervention or control group. Both groups will receive routine 
      care. The intervention group will also receive WeChat-based self-compassion 
      training, which requires participants to complete three tasks every day, 
      including a reading task, a meditation task, and a self-compassion journal task. 
      The control group will receive WeChat-based psychological health education, which 
      will only require participants to read positive articles about psychological 
      health every day. Medication adherence, self-compassion, stigma, and social 
      support will be measured at baseline (T(0)), immediately after the intervention 
      (T(1)), and 3 weeks after the intervention (T(2)). Program feasibility will be 
      evaluated throughout the course of the study, and acceptability will be measured 
      immediately after the intervention (T(1)). EXPECTED RESULTS: The intervention 
      described here will address the barriers to accessing mental health care for 
      people with schizophrenia, including patients' desire for independent management, 
      difficulty accessing providers, and concerns about privacy and stigma. The 
      current study provides guidance for clinical nurses to carry out psychological 
      intervention, with the ultimate aim of addressing the problems associated with a 
      shortage of psychological professionals in low- and middle-income countries.

      and sport-specific pessimism. METHODS: Cyclists were assigned to an eight-week 
      mindfulness intervention, which incorporated a mindful spin-bike training 
      component, or a wait-list control condition. Participants completed baseline and 
      post-test measures of mindfulness, flow, sport-anxiety, and sport-related 
      pessimistic attributions. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance showed significant 
      positive effects on mindfulness, flow, and pessimism for the 27 cyclists in the 
      mindfulness intervention condition compared with the 20 cyclists in the control 
      condition. Changes in mindfulness experienced by the intervention participants 
      were positively associated with changes in flow. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest 
      that mindfulness-based interventions tailored to specific athletic pursuits can 
      be effective in facilitating flow experiences.

AB  - Endometriosis is a gynecological disease that involves a broad biopsychosocial 
      compromise with the potential to create a negative vicious cycle. Despite the 
      complexity of factors influencing women's improvement, most interventions 
      investigated target just the peripheral nociceptive sources of 
      endometriosis-related pain. An alternative is intervening in self-regulation, 
      which can potentially influence multiple domains of the illness experience. The 
      present study examines the effect of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention 
      (bMBI) on attention and autonomic nervous system regulation in women with 
      endometriosis-related pain. Also, explore the interaction between these 
      self-regulation domains and the affective pain dimension. An exploratory analysis 
      of the secondary outcomes of a pilot randomized controlled trial was performed. 
      The vagally-mediated Heart Rate Variability (vmHRV) at rest, cognitive stress, 
      and recovery was employed to measure autonomic regulation. The Flanker and Stroop 
      tasks were used to estimate the attention domains. Results showed that bMBI 
      (n = 26) significantly improved Flanker accuracy and Flanker and Stroop reaction 
      time compared to the control group (n = 28). bMBI significantly increased vmHRV 
      at rest and recovery after cognitive stress. Attention mediated the bMBI effect 
      on affective pain improvement. Results suggest that bMBI improves self-regulation 
      domains with the potential to develop a broad biopsychosocial benefit in the 
      endometriosis context. PERSPECTIVE: This article demonstrates the positive impact 
      of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention on attention and parasympathetic 
      regulation in women suffering from endometriosis-related pain. This 
      mindfulness-induced self-regulation improvement can benefit affective pain and 
      potentially multiple psychophysiological processes relevant to endometriosis.

TI  - Stay Present with Your Phone: A Systematic Review and Standardized Rating of 
      Mindfulness Apps in European App Stores.
PG  - 552-560
LID - 10.1007/s12529-020-09944-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions show positive effects on physical and 
      mental health. For a better integration of mindfulness techniques in daily life, 
      the use of apps may be promising. However, only a few studies have examined the 
      quality of mindfulness apps using a validated standardized instrument. This 
      review aims to evaluate the content, quality, and privacy features of 
      mindfulness-focused apps from European commercial app stores. METHODS: An 
      automated search engine (webcrawler) was used to identify mindfulness-focused 
      apps in the European Apple App- and Google Play store. Content, quality, and 
      privacy features were evaluated by two independent reviewers using the Mobile 
      Application Rating Scale (MARS). The MARS assesses the subscales engagement, 
      functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. RESULTS: Out of 605 
      identified apps, 192 met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality was moderate 
      (M = 3.66, SD = 0.48). Seven apps were tested in a randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT). Most of the apps showed a lack of data security and no privacy policy. The 
      five apps with the highest ratings are from a credible source, include a privacy 
      policy, and are also based on standardized mindfulness and behavior change 
      techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The plethora of often low-quality apps in commercial app 
      stores makes it difficult for users to identify a suitable app. Above that, the 
      lack of scientific verification of effectiveness and shortcomings in privacy 
      protection and security poses potential risks. So far, the potential of 
      mindfulness-focused apps is not exploited in commercial app stores.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study examined the effects of a telephone-administered 
      psycho-education with behavioral activation intervention (TBA) for family 
      caregivers of person's with Alzheimer's dementia to reduce levels of depressive 
      symptoms and burden and to enhance relationship satisfaction with the 
      care-recipient METHODS: A double-blinded randomized trial compared TBA with 
      telephone-based psycho-education with general monitoring (TGM). Ninety-six 
      dementia caregivers were randomized. Both conditions received four weekly 
      psycho-education sessions led by a social worker. TBA participants then received 
      eight bi-weekly behavioral activation practice sessions delivered by 
      paraprofessionals. TGM participants received eight bi-weekly monitoring sessions 
      by paraprofessionals. RESULTS: As compared to TGM, TBA participants reported 
      significantly larger reductions in depressive symptoms and burden and larger 
      improvement in relationship satisfaction. Self-efficacy for controlling upsetting 
      thoughts was found to have a partial meditation effect between TBA and the 
      reduction of depressive symptoms. Qualitative feedback suggested that TBA 
      participants expressed unique gains in awareness and developing new ways of 
      reappraising the caregiving situation. CONCLUSION: TBA was an effective 
      intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and burden as well as to enhance 
      relationship satisfaction in dementia caregivers. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The use 
      of telephone and trained paraprofessionals can enhance the accessibility and 
      sustainability of behavioral activation intervention for dementia family 
      caregivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caregiver stress can pose serious health and psychological concerns, 
      highlighting the importance of timely interventions for family caregivers of 
      people with dementia. Single-session mindfulness-based interventions could be a 
      promising yet under-researched approach to enhancing their mental well-being 
      within their unpredictable, time-constrained contexts. This trial will evaluate 
      the effectiveness and feasibility of a blended mindfulness-based intervention 
      consisting of a single session and app-based follow-up in reducing caregiver 
      stress. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial 
      with two arms (intervention versus an education session on dementia care) and 
      assessments at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months. The eligibility criteria include: 
      family caregivers aged 18 years or older; providing care for an individual with a 
      confirmed medical diagnosis of dementia for at least 3 months prior to 
      recruitment, with a minimum of 4 hours of daily contact; and exhibiting a high 
      level of caregiver stress. The intervention comprises a 90-minute group-based 
      session with various mindfulness practices and psychoeducation. Participants will 
      receive a self-practice toolkit to guide their practice over a duration of 8 
      weeks. Sharing activities will be implemented through an online social media 
      platform. The primary outcome is perceived caregiving stress. The secondary 
      outcomes include depressive symptoms, positive aspects of caregiving, dyadic 
      relationship, trait mindfulness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms of care 
      recipients. The feasibility outcomes include eligibility and enrollment, 
      attendance, adherence to self-practice, and retention, assessed using mixed 
      methods. DISCUSSION: The study will contribute to the evidence base by 
      investigating whether a single-session mindfulness intervention is effective and 
      feasible for reducing caregiver stress among family caregivers of people with 
      dementia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06346223. Registered on

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Caregiver Training in Mindfulness-Based Positive 
      Behavior Support (MBPBS) and Positive Behavior Support (PBS) in a Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 99-111
LID - 10.1007/s12671-018-0895-2 [doi]
AB  - Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are 
      often stressed due to the demands of the job, including the nature and severity 
      of challenging behaviors of the clients, work conditions, degree of management 
      support for the staff, and the demands of implementing some interventions under 
      adverse conditions. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and PBS 
      alone have been shown to be effective in assisting caregivers to better manage 
      the challenging behaviors of clients with intellectual and developmental 
      disabilities. The aim of the present study was to undertake a head-to-head 
      assessment of the effectiveness of MBPBS and PBS alone in a 40-week randomized 
      controlled trial. Of the 123 caregivers who met inclusion criteria, 60 were 
      randomly assigned to MBPBS and 63 to PBS alone, with 59 completing the trial in 
      the MBPBS condition and 57 in the PBS alone condition. Results showed both 
      interventions to be effective, but the caregiver, client, and agency outcomes for 
      MBPBS were uniformly superior to those of PBS alone condition. In addition, the 
      MBPBS training was substantially more cost-effective than the PBS alone training. 
      The present results add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of MBPBS and, 
      if independently replicated, could provide an integrative health care approach in 
      the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities.

TI  - A Low-Intensity Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Mood Symptoms in People with 
      Early Psychosis: Development and Pilot Evaluation.
PG  - 550-560
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1981 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are common in people suffering from 
      early psychosis. Growing evidence shows that mindfulness-based intervention is an 
      effective option in handling depression and anxiety disorders. Current article 
      aims to provide documentation on the development and pilot study, before a RCT of 
      larger scale, evaluating the acceptability and potential effects of a 7-week 
      mindfulness-based intervention programme (MBI-p). METHOD: MBI-p was developed 
      over nine months in 2014. A total of 14 people with early psychosis were 
      recruited to three pilot trials of MBI-p. Eleven of them completed the programme 
      and were interviewed. Eight of them were measured quantitatively at baseline and 
      post-intervention on clinical symptoms, depression and anxiety levels, quality of 
      life and mindfulness. RESULTS: Mixed qualitative and quantitative results 
      supported MBI-p as an acceptable and feasible intervention. Significant 
      statistical improvements were found in depression levels, mental quality of life, 
      general psychopathology and ability to observe emotions and act with awareness. 
      Qualitative comments suggested that the intervention was safe, enjoyable and had 
      a positive impact on mood symptoms. In summary, these results provide a promising 
      pilot support for a potentially effective and cost-efficient treatment option for 
      people with early psychosis. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY 
      PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are common in people with 
      early psychosis but long received little attention. A low-intensity 
      mindfulness-based intervention targeting depression and anxiety symptoms among 
      people with early psychosis was developed and pilot tested. It is feasible and 
      acceptable to use mindfulness-based intervention as a complementary treatment for 
      psychosis.

TI  - Mindfulness-based intervention for hypertension patients with depression and/or 
      anxiety in the community: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 299
LID - 10.1186/s13063-024-08139-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mindfulness-based intervention for hypertension with 
      depression and/or anxiety. METHODS: 10-week mindfulness-based intervention, 
      including health education for hypertension, exclusively for the control group, 
      was administered to the intervention group to assist sixty hypertension patients 
      with depression/anxiety. Among them, the intervention group comprised 8 men and 
      22 women, with a mean age of 60.02 years and a mean duration of hypertension of 
      6.29 years. The control group consisted of 14 men and 16 women with a mean age of 
      57.68 years and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.32 years. The severity of 
      depressive and/or anxiety symptoms was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health 
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 
      along with blood pressure (BP) measurements taken twice daily. The study utilized 
      a self-made self-efficacy scale and awareness of physical and mental health to 
      evaluate mental health and state. RESULTS: The depression PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores 
      reduced by 21.1% or 17.8% in the mindfulness-based intervention group, compared 
      to the control (Z = -2.040, P = 0.041) post 10-week period, suggesting 
      significant reduction in anxiety/stress. These results were consistent with a 
      reduction in systolic BP of 12.24 mm Hg (t = 6.041, P = 0.000). The self-efficacy 
      score of the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to 
      the control (t = 7.818, P < 0.001), while the awareness of physical and mental 
      health in the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to 
      the control (χ2 = 5.781, P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based, short-term 
      focused interventions provide modest relief for depression and/or anxiety and are 
      effective in lowering blood pressure and improving self-efficacy scores. TRIAL

      effect on work-related mental health variables and examined whether the 
      intervention impact was maintained at two- and six-month follow-up assessments. 
      We also examined the training program's effects on work and life. BACKGROUND: 
      Previous research has shown that mindfulness interventions exert positive effects 
      immediately after treatment. However, few studies have examined whether treatment 
      effects are maintained over time or under different circumstances. Moreover, 
      treatment effects among Chinese intensive care unit nurses have rarely been 
      examined. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, non-blinded, parallel-group trial. 
      METHODS: Participants included 90 intensive care unit nurses, divided into two 
      cohorts, who participated in the program in October 2016 and April 2017. They 
      completed validated measures of mindfulness, burnout syndromes, anxiety and 
      depressive symptoms and well-being at baseline (T(1)), immediately after 
      intervention (T(2)), two months after (T(3)) and six months after (T(4)) the 
      intervention. RESULTS: We observed a significant group effect (1) immediately 
      post-intervention and two months after intervention for mindfulness; (2) at two 
      months after intervention for anxiety, depression and subjective well-being and 
      (3) at post-intervention, two months after and six months after for emotional 
      exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the tailored four-week 
      mindfulness-based intervention program improved intensive care unit nurses' 
      mental health, although further research is needed to verify its feasibility in a 
      clinical working environment.

AB  - This study examines the impact of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) 
      versus Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus Waitlist (WL) on 
      self-views in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). One hundred eight 
      unmedicated patients with SAD were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CBGT, MBSR, 
      or WL, and completed a self-referential encoding task (SRET) that assessed 
      self-endorsement of positive and negative self-views pre- and post-treatment. At 
      baseline, 40 healthy controls (HCs) also completed the SRET. At baseline, 
      patients with SAD endorsed greater negative and lesser positive self-views than 
      HCs. Compared to baseline, patients in both CBGT and MBSR decreased negative 
      self-views and increased positive self-views. Improvement in self-views, 
      specifically increases in positive (but not decreases in negative) self-views, 
      predicted CBGT- and MBSR-related decreases in social anxiety symptoms. 
      Enhancement of positive self-views may be a shared therapeutic process for both 
      CBGT and MBSR for SAD.

AB  - Many FA who flew prior to the ban on smoking in commercial aircraft exhibit an 
      unusual pattern of long-term pulmonary dysfunction. This randomized controlled 
      study tested the hypothesis that digitally delivered meditative movement (MM) 
      training improves chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related symptoms 
      in flight attendants (FA) who were exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke (SHCS) 
      while flying. Phase I of this two-phase clinical trial was a single-arm 
      non-randomized pilot study that developed and tested methods for MM intervention; 
      we now report on Phase II, a randomized controlled trial comparing MM to a 
      control group of similar FA receiving health education (HE) videos. Primary 
      outcomes were the 6-min walk test and blood levels of high sensitivity C-reactive 
      protein (hs-CRP). Pulmonary, cardiovascular, autonomic and affective measures 
      were also taken. There were significant improvements in the 6-min walk test, the 
      Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) score, and the COPD 
      Assessment Test. Non-significant trends were observed for increased 
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels, decreased anxiety scores and 
      reduced blood hs-CRP levels, and increased peak expiratory flow (PEF). In a 
      Survey Monkey questionnaire, 81% of participants who completed pre and 
      post-testing expressed mild to strong positive opinions of the study contents, 
      delivery, or impact, while 16% expressed mild negative opinions. Over the course 
      of the year including the study, participant adoption of the MM practices showed 
      a significant and moderately large correlation with overall health improvement; 
      Pearson's R = 0.62, p < 0.005. These results support the hypothesized benefits of 
      video-based MM training for this population. No adverse effects were reported.

TI  - Emotionally aligned: Preliminary results on the effects of a mindfulness-based 
      intervention for depression on congruence between implicit and explicit mood.
PG  - 818-826
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2317 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in treating 
      major depression. Because mindfulness involves monitoring and accepting current 
      experiences, it may lead people resolve incongruencies between emotional 
      responses that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Mindfulness may thus foster 
      congruence between implicit and explicit emotions. The current randomized 
      controlled trial tested this notion. METHODS: N = 39 patients with an acute 
      depressive episode were randomly assigned to an 8-week MBI (n = 24) or a 
      psychopharmacological consultation condition (n = 15). Explicit and implicit mood 
      and depressive symptoms were assessed before treatment and at the end of 
      treatment. RESULTS: Compared with the control condition, patients receiving MBI 
      demonstrated higher congruence between implicit and explicit negative mood after 
      treatment. There was no such difference in congruence of implicit and explicit 
      positive mood. Additional analyses showed that only within the MBI group, 
      individual differences in explicit mood became less stable. In contrast, 
      individual differences in implicit mood remained stable in both groups. 
      LIMITATIONS: There was no control group including an active psychological 
      intervention, the sample was small, and emotional congruence was not assessed 
      within persons. CONCLUSIONS: These findings correspond with the idea that 
      mindfulness reduces incongruencies between implicit and explicit emotional 
      responses. We found preliminary evidence for this effect for negative emotional 
      responses. There was suggestive evidence that congruence arose from the alignment 
      of explicit responses (which became less stable) to implicit responses (which 
      remained stable). Studying the interplay between implicit and explicit processes 
      may shed light on the working mechanisms of clinical-psychological interventions.

TI  - School Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Youth, and Considerations for Anxiety, 
      Depression, and a Positive School Climate-A Systematic Literature Review.
LID - 10.3390/children10050861 [doi]
LID - 861
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are growing in popularity, with research 
      concerning their efficacy with youth populations. Following a preliminary 
      analysis of the existing literature, and given the positive effects of such 
      programs, we felt it relevant to assess whether research has considered the 
      implications for MBIs on children and adolescents, with regard to depression, 
      anxiety, and school climate. OBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the effect of MBIs as 
      innovative interventions addressing youths in school settings, with special 
      consideration for anxiety, depression, and school climate outcomes. METHOD: This 
      review investigates the existing literature in the field of mindfulness, using 
      quasi-experimental and randomized control trial (RCT) models, targeted at youth 
      (5-18 years) in school settings. A search was carried out in four 
      databases-WebofScience, Google Scholar, PubMed, and PsycARTICLES. This resulted 
      in 39 articles, which were sorted based on predetermined inclusion criteria; 12 
      articles qualified. RESULTS: The results show discrepancies in terms of 
      methodological and implementation variables, types of interventions, instructor 
      trainings, assessment measures, and choice of practices and exercises, which make 
      the effects of existing school MBIs difficult to compare. Consistencies were 
      observed in emotional and behavioral regulation, prosocial behaviors, and 
      reducing stress and anxiety in students. The results of this systematic review 
      also suggest that MBIs could be potential mediators in improving student 
      well-being and environmental factors, such as school and class climates. 
      Specifically, children's sense of safety and community can be improved by an 
      improved quality of relationships between students, their peers, and teachers. 
      Future research should consider incorporating school climate perspectives, such 
      as implementing whole-school MBI approaches and using replicable and comparable 
      study designs and methods, whilst considering the capacities and limitations of 
      the academic and institutional context.

      dementia (PWD). METHODS: A prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled 
      trial design was adopted. Fifty-seven participants were recruited from the 
      community and randomized into either the modified MBSR group (n = 27) or modified 
      MBCT group (n = 26), receiving seven face-to-face intervention sessions for more 
      than 16 weeks. Various psychological outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), 
      immediately after intervention (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: 
      Both interventions were found to be feasible in view of the high attendance (more 
      than 70.0%) and low attrition (3.8%) rates. The mixed analysis of variance 
      (ANOVA) results showed positive within-group effects on perceived stress 
      (p = .030, Cohen's d = 0.54), depressive symptoms (p = .002, Cohen's d = 0.77), 
      and subjective caregiver burden (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.12) in both 
      interventions across the time points, whereas the modified MBCT had a larger 
      effect on stress reduction, compared with the modified MBSR (p = .019). 
      CONCLUSION: Both the modified MBSR and MBCT are acceptable to family caregivers 
      of PWD. Their preliminary effects were improvements in stress, depressive 
      symptoms, and subjective burden. The modified MBCT may be more suitable for 
      caregivers of PWD than the MBSR. A future clinical trial is needed to confirm 
      their effectiveness in improving the psychological well-being of caregivers of 
      PWD.

      mindfulness-based relapse prevention effects on alcohol and other drug use 
      outcomes.

AB  - Distress tolerance refers to the degree to which an individual is able to 
      withstand negative psychological and/or physical states. Empirical literature has 
      indicated that lower distress tolerance is associated with a number of negative 
      alcohol and other drug (AOD) use outcomes and psychopathology. Mindfulness 
      meditation focuses on enhancing affect regulation, and may be particularly 
      beneficial for individuals with lower distress tolerance. This secondary analysis 
      evaluated the basic psychometric properties of the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) 
      in a clinical sample of individuals with AOD-use disorders and tested whether 
      distress tolerance for negative psychological states moderated treatment effects 
      on AOD outcomes in an initial efficacy trial of mindfulness-based relapse 
      prevention (MBRP). It was hypothesized that participants with lower distress 
      tolerance would report fewer AOD use days over the 4-month follow-up if they 
      received MBRP versus treatment as usual (TAU). Participants (N=168) in the parent 
      RCT were recruited from a private, nonprofit agency providing inpatient and 
      outpatient care for individuals with AOD-use disorders. Assessments of 60-day 
      frequency of AOD use, as measured by the Timeline Followback, were conducted at 
      baseline, immediately postintervention, and 2months and 4months following the 
      intervention. Distress tolerance, as measured by the DTS, was assessed at 
      baseline. Results indicated a one-factor solution, which is consistent with how 
      the DTS has been implemented in other studies. As predicted, DTS was positively 
      associated with all mindfulness subscales, suggesting its convergent validity in 
      this clinical sample. Findings showed the hypothesized time×treatment×distress 
      tolerance interaction, and thereby indicated that participants with lower 
      distress tolerance who received MBRP treatment experienced a greater curvilinear 
      decrease in AOD use days over time than those with lower distress tolerance who 
      received TAU. However, the observed plateau effect suggests that these effects 
      were not maintained at the 4-month follow-up. Findings suggest that distress 
      tolerance is a clinically relevant client characteristic to consider in matching 
      participants to aftercare treatment and that MBRP may be particularly helpful for 
      individuals with lower distress tolerance.

TI  - A controlled trial of adaptive disclosure-enhanced to improve functioning and 
      treat posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 150-164
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000873 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This is a randomized controlled trial (NCT03056157) of an enhanced 
      adaptive disclosure (AD) psychotherapy compared to present-centered therapy (PCT; 
      each 12 sessions) in 174 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      related to traumatic loss (TL) and moral injury (MI). AD employs different 
      strategies for different trauma types. AD-Enhanced (AD-E) uses letter writing 
      (e.g., to the deceased), loving-kindness meditation, and bolstered homework to 
      facilitate improved functioning to repair TL and MI-related trauma. METHOD: The 
      primary outcomes were the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), evaluated at baseline, 
      throughout treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups (Brief Inventory of 
      Psychosocial Functioning was also administered), the Clinician-Administered PTSD 
      Scale (CAPS-5), the Dimensions of Anger Reactions, the Revised Conflict Tactics 
      Scale, and the Quick Drinking Screen. RESULTS: There were statistically 
      significant between-group differences on two outcomes: The intent-to-treat (ITT) 
      mixed-model analysis of SDS scores indicated greater improvement from baseline to 
      posttreatment in the AD-E group (d = 2.97) compared to the PCT group, d = 1.86; 
      -2.36, 95% CI [-3.92, -0.77], t(1,510) = -2.92, p < .001, d = 0.15. Twenty-one 
      percent more AD-E cases made clinically significant changes on the SDS than PCT 
      cases. From baseline to posttreatment, AD-E was also more efficacious on the 
      CAPS-5 (d = 0.39). These differential effects did not persist at follow-up 
      intervals. CONCLUSION: This was the first psychotherapy of veterans with 
      TL/MI-related PTSD to show superiority relative to PCT with respect to 
      functioning and PTSD, although the differential effect sizes were small to medium 
      and not maintained at follow-up. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and its 
      prevalence is on the rise. One of the most debilitating aspects of depression is 
      the dominance and persistence of depressive rumination, a state of mind that is 
      linked to onset and recurrence of depression. Mindfulness meditation trains 
      adaptive attention regulation and present-moment embodied awareness, skills that 
      may be particularly useful during depressive mind states characterized by 
      negative ruminative thoughts. METHODS: In a randomized controlled functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging study (N = 80), we looked at the neurocognitive 
      mechanisms behind mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (n = 50) for recurrent 
      depression compared with treatment as usual (n = 30) across experimentally 
      induced states of rest, mindfulness practice and rumination, and the relationship 
      with dispositional psychological processes. RESULTS: Mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy compared with treatment as usual led to decreased salience network 
      connectivity to the lingual gyrus during a ruminative state, and this change in 
      salience network connectivity mediated improvements in the ability to sustain and 
      control attention to body sensations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that a 
      clinically effective mindfulness intervention modulates neurocognitive 
      functioning during depressive rumination and the ability to sustain attention to 
      the body.

LID - 10.1002/jclp.22549 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Innovative approaches to the treatment of war-related posttraumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) are needed. We report on secondary psychological outcomes 
      of a randomized controlled trial of integrative exercise (IE) using aerobic and 
      resistance exercise with mindfulness-based principles and yoga. We expected-in 
      parallel to observed improvements in PTSD intensity and quality of 
      life-improvements in mindfulness, interoceptive bodily awareness, and positive 
      states of mind. METHOD: A total of 47 war veterans with PTSD were randomized to 
      12-week IE versus waitlist. Changes in mindfulness, interoceptive awareness, and 
      states of mind were assessed by self-report standard measures. RESULTS: Large 
      effect sizes for the intervention were observed on Five-Facet Mindfulness 
      Questionnaire Non-Reactivity (d = .85), Multidimensional Assessment of 
      Interoceptive Awareness Body Listening (d = .80), and Self-Regulation (d = 1.05). 
      CONCLUSION: In a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week IE program for war 
      veterans with PTSD, we saw significant improvements in mindfulness, interoceptive 
      bodily awareness, and positive states of mind compared to a waitlist.

AB  - Stress and anxiety pose a threat to college students' academic performance as 
      well as their long-term mental and physical health, but the time constraints of a 
      rigorous academic schedule make it difficult to offer even brief mental health 
      interventions. A convenience sample of full-time students at a public university 
      was recruited for a 5-week study conducted mostly using an online platform. 
      Participants were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT) 
      intervention or a Neutral Clay Task (NCT). Anxiety, perceived stress, and 
      salivary cortisol outcomes were measured. A total of n = 77 participants 
      completed the study. The MBAT group experienced significant reductions in anxiety 
      and perceived stress compared to the NCT group. Significant reductions in 
      salivary cortisol were observed, but only time could be identified as a 
      confounding variable. Art making alone is not enough to induce significant 
      positive responses, but this study suggests MBAT can, and that an online 
      intervention could offer feasible and accessible mental health services on 
      college campuses. Further refinement of biological data collection and analysis 
      is needed to determine what the mediating effects MBAT could have, if any, at the 
      molecular level.

TI  - Feasibility of mindfulness-based therapy in patients recovering from a first 
      psychotic episode: a pilot study.
PG  - 64-70
LID - 10.1111/j.1751-7893.2012.00356.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Recently, a mindfulness therapy for people with psychotic disorders was 
      developed. However, clinicians and researchers are cautious given case reports in 
      which extensive meditation provoked psychotic symptoms in people with a psychotic 
      disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, adverse 
      effects and possible favourable effects of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) in 
      people recently recovering from a first episode of psychosis. METHOD: A 
      nonrandomized, non-controlled prospective follow-up study. Patients were offered 
      an MBT that consisted of eight 1-hour sessions within a 4-week time span. 
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Symptoms Checklist 90 and the Southampton 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire were assessed before and after the therapy. RESULTS: Of 
      the 16 persons who started MBT, 13 completed (81.5%) the therapy. No significant 
      increase in psychotic symptoms was found. Between two meetings, one participant 
      initially misunderstood the mindfulness instructions, which led to an increase in 
      distress. No increased awareness of intrusive thoughts or visual or auditory 
      hallucinations was reported by participants. We found a decrease in agoraphobic 
      symptoms (p < 0.028) and in psychoneuroticism (P < 0.025). CONCLUSION: The MBT 
      had no significant adverse effect on psychotic symptoms in patients in this small 
      pilot study, neither did it raise the level of mindfulness in the participants. A 
      decrease in psychological symptoms was found, although one patient experienced an 
      increase in symptoms of distress. Our study demonstrates that therapists should 
      be cautious that therapy and practice instructions are understood properly. 
      Future studies are feasible and needed, in larger samples with an RCT design, in 
      order to draw conclusions regarding the effects of the MBT.

TI  - Meditation-based lifestyle modification in mild to moderate depression-A 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 363-375
LID - 10.1002/da.23249 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is a global key challenge in mental health care. The 
      implementation of effective, low-risk and cost-effective interventions to reduce 
      its disease burden is a necessity. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      efficacy of the new Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program, a 
      "second-generation" mindfulness-based intervention, in depressive outpatients. 
      METHODS: Eighty-one patients with mild to moderate depression were randomized 
      into three groups: intervention group (MBLM), control group (CONTROL), and 
      treatment as usual group (TAU). The primary outcome was the change of depressive 
      symptoms as administered by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) after 4 and 
      8 weeks. Secondary outcome variables included the Brief Symptom Checklist-18 and 
      the Perceived Stress Scale-10. A 6-month follow-up was conducted. RESULTS: A 
      greater reduction of depressive symptoms was found in MBLM participants compared 
      to CONTROL (p < .001, η(p)(2)  = 0.11, d = 0.70) and TAU ( p < .001, ηp2 
      = 0.10, d = 0.67 ) with a 13.15 points reduction of BDI-II score versus 1.71 
      points (CONTROL) and 3.34 points (TAU) after 8 weeks. Between-group post hoc 
      tests for all secondary outcomes and at follow-up also yielded significant 
      between-group differences with medium to large effect sizes in favor of MBLM. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Study results showed beneficial effects of MBLM in depressed 
      outpatients. Further high-quality controlled clinical studies including 
      qualitative research are needed to investigate the specific and unspecific 
      effects of the MBLM program in depression and other medical conditions.

TI  - Optimization of a Transdiagnostic Mobile Emotion Regulation Intervention for 
      University Students: Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial.
PG  - e46603
LID - 10.2196/46603 [doi]
LID - e46603
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many university students experience mental health problems such as 
      anxiety and depression. To support their mental health, a transdiagnostic mobile 
      app intervention has been developed. The intervention provides short exercises 
      rooted in various approaches (eg, positive psychology, mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and acceptance and commitment therapy) that aim to facilitate 
      adaptive emotion regulation (ER) to help students cope with the various stressors 
      they encounter during their time at university. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this 
      study are to investigate whether the intervention and its components function as 
      intended and how participants engage with them. In addition, this study aims to 
      monitor changes in distress symptoms and ER skills and identify relevant 
      contextual factors that may moderate the intervention's impact. METHODS: A 
      sequential explanatory mixed methods design combining a microrandomized trial and 
      semistructured interviews will be used. During the microrandomized trial, 
      students (N=200) will be prompted via the mobile app twice a day for 3 weeks to 
      evaluate their emotional states and complete a randomly assigned intervention 
      (ie, an exercise supporting ER) or a control intervention (ie, a health 
      information snippet). A subsample of participants (21/200, 10.5%) will 
      participate in interviews exploring their user experience with the app and the 
      completed exercises. The primary outcomes will be changes in emotional states and 
      engagement with the intervention (ie, objective and subjective engagement). 
      Objective engagement will be evaluated through log data (eg, exercise completion 
      time). Subjective engagement will be evaluated through exercise likability and 
      helpfulness ratings as well as user experience interviews. The secondary outcomes 
      will include the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress 
      symptoms). Finally, the contextual moderators of intervention effectiveness will 
      be explored (eg, the time of day and momentary emotional states). RESULTS: The 
      study commenced on February 9, 2023, and the data collection was concluded on 
      June 13, 2023. Of the 172 eligible participants, 161 (93.6%) decided to 
      participate. Of these 161 participants, 137 (85.1%) completed the first phase of 
      the study. A subsample of participants (18/172, 10.5%) participated in the user 
      experience interviews. Currently, the data processing and analyses are being 
      conducted. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the functioning of 
      the intervention and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the findings 
      will shed light on potential changes in the distal outcomes of the intervention 
      (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms), which will be considered when designing a 
      follow-up randomized controlled trial evaluating the full-scale effectiveness of 
      this intervention. Finally, the results and data gathered will be used to design 
      and train a recommendation algorithm that will be integrated into the app linking 
      students to relevant content. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05576883;

TI  - Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Its Effects on Psychoimmunological 
      Factors of Chemically Pulmonary Injured Veterans.
PG  - 476-486
AB  - Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a treatment program for relieving 
      stress and coping with chronic illnesses. In recent three decades, studies have 
      shown that MBSR has a positive effect on physical and psychological dimensions of 
      chronic illnesses. Chemically pulmonary injured veterans have chronic pulmonary 
      and psychological problems due to mustard gas exposure and complications of 
      Iran-Iraq war. These stresses have negative effects on their general health and 
      immune system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted on 
      psychoneuroimmunology and MBSR in these patients. Forty male pulmonary injured 
      veterans were randomly divided in two groups with 20 participants (MBSR and 
      wait-list control). Then MBSR group received 8 weekly sessions of intervention. 
      We tested mental health based on general health questionnaire (GHQ)-28 
      questionnaire, health-related quality of life (based on St. George respiratory 
      questionnaire (SGRQ) ) and immunity in MBSR groups; before and after intervention 
      "mixed factorial analyses of variance" test was used for analyzing data fpr each 
      dependent variable and appropriate t-tests were done in The necessary condition. 
      Results showed that mental health and health- related quality of life, in MBSR 
      group compared to wait-list control improved [F (1,38)=26.46, p<0.001; F 
      (1,38)=49.52, p<0.001 respectively] significantly.  Moreover, a significant 
      increase was reported in the lymphocyte proliferation with phytohemagglutinin 
      (PHA) [F (1,38)=16.24, p<0.001], and peripheral blood IL-17 [F (1,38)=56.71, 
      p<0.001] However, lymphocyte (CD4+, CD8+, and NK-cell) percentages were not 
      affected significantly [F (1,38)=2.21, p=0.14] ,[F (1,38)=0.90, p=0.78] and [F 
      (1,38)=1.79, p=0.18], respectively. This study suggests that MBSR may be a new 
      treatment approach for improving immunity and overall health in chemically 
      pulmonary injured veterans.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for lung cancer patients and their partners: 
      Results of a mixed methods pilot study.
PG  - 652-60
LID - 10.1177/0269216315572720 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer patients and partners show high rates of impaired quality 
      of life and heightened distress levels. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction has 
      proven to be effective in reducing psychological distress in cancer patients. 
      However, studies barely included lung cancer patients. AIM: We examined whether 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction might be a feasible and effective intervention 
      for patients with lung cancer and partners. DESIGN: Mindfulness-Based Stress 
      Reduction is a training in which mindfulness practices are combined with 
      psycho-education to help participants cope with distress. In this mixed methods 
      pilot study, questionnaires on psychological distress and quality of life were 
      administered before, directly after and 3 months after the Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction training, in combination with semi-structured interviews. 
      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients with lung cancer and partners were recruited at 
      one tertiary care academic medical centre. A total of 19 lung cancer patients and 
      16 partners participated in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training. 
      RESULTS: Most patients were diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer. Vast 
      majority completed the training. Those receiving anti-cancer treatment did not 
      miss more sessions than patients who were not currently treated. Patients and 
      partners felt positive about participating in a peer group and with their 
      partner. Among participants no significant changes were found in psychological 
      distress. Caregiver burden in partners decreased significantly after following 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. The qualitative analysis showed that the 
      training seemed to instigate a process of change in participants. CONCLUSION: The 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training seemed to be feasible for patients 
      with lung cancer and their partners. A randomized controlled trial is needed to 
      examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction in reducing 
      psychological distress in lung cancer patients and partners.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction and an organizational health 
      intervention on Dutch teachers' mental health.
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daac008 [doi]
LID - daac008
AB  - This study aimed to test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      (MBSR) combined with an organizational health intervention. A cluster randomized 
      controlled trial was conducted in five Dutch secondary vocational schools. 
      Teachers were assigned to Intervention Group 1 (IG1; MBSR) or 2 (IG2; MBSR and an 
      organizational health intervention), or to the Waiting List Group. The primary 
      outcome variable was mindfulness. Secondary outcomes included other mental health 
      outcomes, work performance, personal competencies, and work-related perceptions. 
      Data was collected before (T0), immediately after (T1), and three (T2) and nine 
      months (T3) after the MBSR training and analyzed applying repeated measures 
      between-subjects designs. As the additional intervention showed no effects, IG1 
      and IG2 were merged (IG). MBSR had positive short-term effects on the total 
      mindfulness score, its dimensions 'observing' and 'non-reactivity', and the work 
      engagement dimension 'dedication'. Long-term effects were found for the total 
      mindfulness score, its dimensions 'observing', 'non-reactivity', and 
      'non-judging', sleep quality complaints, negative emotions, and negative 
      work-home interaction. IG displayed a larger short- and long-term decrease in 
      organizational commitment. No significant differences were found for work 
      performance, personal competencies, and work-related perceptions. Although 
      teachers did not perceive a decrease in job demands after the training, they felt 
      more mindful and lowered their organizational commitment. Their mental health 
      improved and their dedication during work increased. These findings may suggest 
      that enhanced mindfulness enabled them to mentally disengage from work during 
      their leisure time, which allowed them to experience fewer symptoms of 
      psychological strain. The trail is registered with the Dutch Trial Register 
      (www.trialregister.nl): NL5581 (July 2016).

TI  - Coping with stress in medical students: results of a randomized controlled trial 
      using a mindfulness-based stress prevention training (MediMind) in Germany.
PG  - 316

AB  - BACKGROUND: High prevalence rates of psychological distress in medical training 
      and later professional life indicate a need for prevention. Different types of 
      intervention were shown to have good effects, but little is known about the 
      relative efficacy of different types of stress management interventions, and 
      methodological limitations have been reported. In order to overcome some of these 
      limitations, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of a specifically 
      developed mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students 
      (MediMind) on measures of distress, coping and psychological morbidity. METHODS: 
      We report on a prospective randomized controlled trial with three study 
      conditions: experimental treatment (MediMind), standard treatment (Autogenic 
      Training) and a control group without treatment. The sample consisted of medical 
      or dental students in the second or eighth semester. They completed self-report 
      questionnaires at baseline, after the training and at one year follow-up. 
      Distress (Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress, TICS) was 
      assessed as the primary outcome and coping (Brief COPE) as a co-primary outcome. 
      Effects on the psychological morbidity (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI) as a 
      secondary outcome were expected one year after the trainings. RESULTS: Initially, 
      N = 183 students were randomly allocated to the study groups. At one year 
      follow-up N = 80 could be included into the per-protocol analysis: MediMind (n 
      =31), Autogenic Training (n = 32) and control group (n = 17). A selective 
      drop-out for students who suffered more often from psychological symptoms was 
      detected (p = .020). MANCOVA's on TICS and Brief COPE revealed no significant 
      interaction effects. On the BSI, a significant overall interaction effect became 
      apparent (p = .002, η2partial = .382), but post hoc analyses were not 
      significant. Means of the Global Severity Index (BSI) indicated that MediMind may 
      contribute to a decrease in psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION: Due to the high 
      and selective dropout rates, the results cannot be generalized and further 
      research is necessary. Since the participation rate of the trainings was high, a 
      need for further prevention programs is indicated. The study gives important 
      suggestions on further implementation and evaluation of stress prevention in 
      medical schools. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is recorded at German Clinical 
      Trials Register under the number DRKS00005354 (08.11.2013).

LID - 10.1111/aphw.12431 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects and mechanisms of an online short-term 
      audio-based mindfulness (SAM) intervention program on positive affect and 
      explored how well-being and negative affect influenced these effects and 
      mechanisms. Participants (N = 100) were randomized into an intervention group 
      (n = 50) and a control group (n = 50). Those in the mindfulness group underwent 
      3 weeks of an online SAM program and completed the online measures four times, 
      while those in the control group completed the measures twice. Participants 
      completed measures including the World Health Organization Well-Being Index, the 
      Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. 
      The effects of measures in both groups were compared. Parallel process latent 
      growth curve modeling analysis was used to explore the longitudinal moderated 
      mediation effects. The results showed that SAM was effective at improving 
      positive affect, mindfulness, well-being, and reducing negative affect. 
      Mindfulness growth speed during the intervention period mediated the relationship 
      between SAM and positive affect improvement speed. The moderation effects of 
      baseline well-being and negative effect on mediation effects were found to be 
      significant. The SAM program was effective for the general public and was more 
      beneficial for those with medium/high well-being and low/medium negative affect.

TI  - Helping the helpers: mindfulness training for burnout in pediatric oncology--a 
      pilot program.
PG  - 275-84
LID - 10.1177/1043454213504497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout, a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and 
      diminished feelings of accomplishment, is common among pediatric oncology staff. 
      This study explores a mindfulness-based course (MBC) to decrease burnout in a 
      multidisciplinary group of pediatric oncology staff members in the United States 
      and Israel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight participants, mostly nurses, were 
      randomized to either the MBC intervention or a control group. MBC participants 
      received eight weekly sessions of mindfulness education. The primary outcome 
      studied was burnout. Secondary outcomes studied included depression and perceived 
      stress. RESULTS: Nearly 100% of the subjects exhibited signs of burnout at 
      baseline and MBC did not result in any significant improvement in scores on 
      burnout, perceived stress or depression scales. Qualitative analysis of diaries 
      kept by subjects revealed reduced stress, improved inner peace, compassion and 
      joy, better focus and self-awareness and less somatic symptoms in the 
      intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout is a major problem in pediatric oncology 
      staff. Mindfulness practices can be taught in the workplace and may be a useful 
      component of a multidimensional strategy to reduce burnout in this population.

TI  - The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on Depression, Cognition, 
      and Immunity in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Feasibility Study.
PG  - 1365-1381
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S249196 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based programs have shown a promising effect on several 
      health factors associated with increased risk of dementia and the conversion from 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia such as depression, stress, cognitive 
      decline, immune system and brain structural and functional changes. Studies on 
      mindfulness in MCI subjects are sparse and frequently lack control intervention 
      groups. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and the effect of 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) practice on depression, cognition and 
      immunity in MCI compared to cognitive training. METHODS: Twenty-eight MCI 
      subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. MBSR group underwent 8-week MBSR 
      program. Control group underwent 8-week cognitive training. Their cognitive and 
      immunological profiles and level of depressive symptoms were examined at 
      baseline, after each 8-week intervention (visit 2, V2) and six months after each 
      intervention (visit 3, V3). MBSR participants completed feasibility questionnaire 
      at V2. RESULTS: Twenty MCI patients completed the study (MBSR group n=12, control 
      group n=8). MBSR group showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms at 
      both V2 (p=0.03) and V3 (p=0.0461) compared to the baseline. There was a minimal 
      effect on cognition - a group comparison analysis showed better psychomotor speed 
      in the MBSR group compared to the control group at V2 (p=0.0493) but not at V3. 
      There was a detectable change in immunological profiles in both groups, more 
      pronounced in the MBSR group. Participants checked only positive/neutral answers 
      concerning the attractivity/length of MBSR intervention. More severe cognitive 
      decline (PVLT≤36) was associated with the lower adherence to home practice. 
      CONCLUSION: MBSR is well-accepted potentially promising intervention with 
      positive effect on cognition, depressive symptoms and immunological profile.

TI  - A Single-Session, 2-Hour Version of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement 
      (One MORE) Improves Chronic Pain Patients' Pain-Related Outcomes Through 3-Month 
      Follow-Up in a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 869-877
LID - 10.1089/jicm.2023.0501 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Traditional, 8-week, mindfulness-based interventions can 
      effectively treat chronic pain, but require a time and resource investment too 
      burdensome for many patients and providers. The solution to this logistical 
      challenge may be to distill the core, therapeutic elements of an efficacious 
      8-week, mindfulness-based intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement 
      (MORE), into a 2-h, single-session intervention. Methods: In this study, the 
      authors conducted a waitlist-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the 
      impact of a 2-h, single-session adaptation of MORE (i.e., One MORE) on chronic 
      pain patients' (N = 40) pain-related outcomes through 3-month follow-up. Results: 
      Results indicated that One MORE significantly improved chronic pain patients' 
      pain catastrophizing (i.e., primary outcome; F = 9.97, p = 0.002), pain intensity 
      (F = 26.58, p < 0.001), pain interference (F = 39.43, p < 0.001), physical 
      function (F = 16.29, p < 0.001), sleep (F = 16.66, p < 0.001), anxiety 
      (F = 12.54, p < 0.001), and depression (F = 17.48, p < 0.001). One MORE also 
      significantly increased theoretically indicated therapeutic mechanisms through 
      the 3-month follow-up: mindfulness, positive reappraisal, savoring, 
      self-transcendence. Discussion: Study results are promising, and if replicated, 
      would suggest that One MORE is a highly scalable, low-cost (e.g., sustainable), 
      nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic pain. Clinical Trial Registration: 
      NCT05194241.

AB  - This paper reported the health effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      (MBSR) among 49 Chinese military recruits with psychological distress in a 
      12-week study. Participants were randomized into a MBSR and a waitlist group. 
      Previously validated questionnaires were administered to both groups at four time 
      points: baseline, 5, 8, and 12 weeks after participation. Compared to the 
      waitlist group, the MBSR group showed more improvements in mindfulness and 
      general health, as well as more stress reduction at 12-week follow-up. This study 
      suggested that MBSR could be a promising health intervention for improving 
      general health and reducing stress in Chinese military recruits.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, research on mindfulness and humor has begun to spark 
      interest, both being essential contributors to well-being. This article proposes 
      that forms of humor that share intention and attitudinal foundations with 
      mindfulness, constitute the foundation of a mindful-humorous perspective and 
      mindful humor. Once intention and attitude are in alignment, shared mechanisms 
      underlying a mindful-humorous perspective may lead to synergetic effects (e.g., 
      reinforcing a shift in perspective and attitudinal foundations) as summarized in 
      the proposed mindful humor filter model (MHFM). Based on this theoretical 
      framework, the humor-enriched mindfulness-based program (HEMBP) was developed and 
      evaluated for validity and efficacy in a randomized controlled trial as a first 
      step to test the newly introduced model. METHODS: A total of 60 participants were 
      randomly allocated to either the HEMBP or a wait-list control group. 
      Participants' mindfulness, comic styles (e.g., benevolent humor, sarcasm, and 
      cynicism), psychological well-being, life satisfaction, stress, and gelotophobia 
      (fear of being laughed at) were assessed 1 week before and after training, and at 
      a 1-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to model changes in 
      outcome variables over time. RESULTS: The HEMBP was effective in increasing 
      mindfulness, benevolent humor, and psychological well-being, and in reducing 
      sarcasm, cynicism, stress, and gelotophobia, compared to the control group. 
      CONCLUSION: Results support the validity and efficacy of the HEMBP as a promising 
      approach for improving well-being and reducing stress. The HEMBP broadens the 
      scope of existing mindfulness-based programs by cultivating a mindful-humorous 
      outlook on life, facilitating mindfulness practice and insights, and fostering 
      positive emotions and relationships with others through mindful humor. Results 
      are also suggestive of the validity of the mindful humor filter model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative 
      disease in developed countries. Current treatment for PD is pharmacologically 
      focused and can have significant side-effects. There is increasing interest in 
      holistic approaches including mindfulness to help manage the challenges 
      associated with living with PD. We hypothesised that there would be an 
      improvement in PD associated function and wellbeing in participants after 
      participating in a 6-week mindfulness-based lifestyle program, and that these 
      improvements would be sustainable at 6 months. Our primary objective was to 
      determine changes in function and wellbeing associated with PD. METHODS: An 
      exploratory prospective, mixed-method, randomised control trial incorporating a 
      before and after design with a waitlist control, with an embedded qualitative 
      component was conducted in 2012-2013. Participants included community living 
      adults with disability congruent to H&Y Stage 2 PD, aged 18-75, fluent in spoken 
      and written English and able to attend at least four of six sessions of the 
      program. Participants were randomised to the intervention or wait-list control 
      groups at two locations. All participants in the wait-list control group 
      eventually received the intervention. Two randomisation codes were created for 
      each location. Allocation to the intervention or wait-list control was by random 
      number generation. The program facilitator and participants were blinded to 
      participant data. RESULTS: Group 1 included 35 participants and group 2 (the 
      waitlist control), 37. Data was analysed from 24 (group 1) and 33 (group 2) 
      participants. The intervention group, compared to the waitlist control, showed a 
      small improvement in function and wellbeing associated with PD immediately after 
      the program (t-score = -0.59) and at 6-month post intervention (t-score = -1.42) 
      as reported by the PDQ-39 SI. However this finding was not significant (p = 0.56 
      and 0.16 respectively). A small yet significant effect size (β = 0.23) in PDQ-39 
      ADL was reported in group 1 after 6-months post-intervention. This showed a 
      positive improvement in the ADL as reported by group 1 after 6-months (t-score 
      -1.8, p = 0.04). Four secondary measures are reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      suggest mindfulness-based lifestyle programs have potential to assist 
      participants in managing the ongoing difficulties associated with a neurological 
      condition such as Parkinson's disease. Importantly, our study shows promise for 
      the long term benefits of such programs. Improvements to participant activities 
      in daily living and mindfulness were retained at 6-months post intervention. A 
      more definitive study should be conducted in a larger sample of PD patients to 
      further explore these findings and their impact on reducing stress and anxiety in 
      PD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

TI  - Brief mindfulness-based training and mindfulness trait attenuate psychological 
      stress in university students: a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress in University settings has grown and became a 
      public health concern. In this context, contemplative practices such as 
      mindfulness have been proposed as a strategy to help students on stress 
      management. METHODS: Forty university students (20 female), aged between 18 to 
      30 years (mean = 24.15; SD = 3.56), with no previous experience with meditation 
      or yoga were recruited at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte and 
      randomized to a mindfulness training (MT) or active control (AC) groups. We 
      analyzed measures of anxiety, affect, stress, as well as state and trait 
      mindfulness in order to evaluate the effects of trait mindfulness and a brief 
      mindfulness intervention in forty healthy young students. Participants were 
      classified as Low (n = 27, females = 13) or High (n = 13, females = 7) Trait 
      Mindfulness by k-means clustering and compared between them using Wilcoxon sum 
      rank test. Furthermore, the sample was randomly allocated to an AC (n = 20, 
      females = 10) or a MT (n = 20, females = 10) group, and mixed analysis of 
      variance was performed to analyze the effect of interventions. The mechanisms and 
      role of trait mindfulness in the intervention was assessed by a moderated 
      mediation analysis. RESULTS: We found that High Trait individuals have lower 
      anxiety trait, anxiety state and perceived stress levels. Only the MT group 
      reduced their anxiety state and perceived stress after the intervention and 
      increased their state mindfulness. Both groups reduced negative affect and 
      cortisol, and no change was found in positive affect. Moderated mediation 
      analysis showed that the training-induced change in state mindfulness mediated 
      the increase in positive affect and the decrease in perceived stress and 
      cortisol, regardless of trait mindfulness. For anxiety state the decrease only 
      occurred in individuals with High Trait Mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these 
      results suggest that higher trait mindfulness is associated with low levels of 
      psychological distress and that a brief mindfulness-based intervention seems to 
      be useful to reduce distress measures in university students. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
