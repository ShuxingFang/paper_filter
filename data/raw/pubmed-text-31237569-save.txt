TI  - Efficacy of the Mindfulness Meditation Mobile App "Calm" to Reduce Stress Among 
      College Students: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e14273

AB  - BACKGROUND: College students experience high levels of stress. Mindfulness 
      meditation delivered via a mobile app may be an appealing, efficacious way to 
      reduce stress in college students. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the initial 
      efficacy and sustained effects of an 8-week mindfulness meditation mobile 
      app-Calm-compared to a wait-list control on stress, mindfulness, and 
      self-compassion in college students with elevated stress. We also explored the 
      intervention's effect on health behaviors (ie, sleep disturbance, alcohol 
      consumption [binge drinking], physical activity, and healthy eating [fruit and 
      vegetable consumption]) and the feasibility and acceptability of the app. 
      METHODS: This study was a randomized, wait-list, control trial with assessments 
      at baseline, postintervention (8 weeks), and at follow-up (12 weeks). 
      Participants were eligible if they were current full-time undergraduate students 
      and (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) scored ≥14 points on the Perceived Stress 
      Scale, (3) owned a smartphone, (4) were willing to download the Calm app, (5) 
      were willing to be randomized, and (7) were able to read and understand English. 
      Participants were asked to meditate using Calm at least 10 minutes per day. A P 
      value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 88 
      participants were included in the analysis. The mean age (SD) was 20.41 (2.31) 
      years for the intervention group and 21.85 (6.3) years for the control group. 
      There were significant differences in all outcomes (stress, mindfulness, and 
      self-compassion) between the intervention and control groups after adjustment for 
      covariates postintervention (all P<.04). These effects persisted at follow-up 
      (all P<.03), except for the nonreacting subscale of mindfulness (P=.08). There 
      was a significant interaction between group and time factors in perceived stress 
      (P=.002), mindfulness (P<.001), and self-compassion (P<.001). Bonferroni posthoc 
      tests showed significant within-group mean differences for perceived stress in 
      the intervention group (P<.001), while there were no significant within-group 
      mean differences in the control group (all P>.19). Similar results were found for 
      mindfulness and self-compassion. Effect sizes ranged from moderate (0.59) to 
      large (1.24) across all outcomes. A significant group×time interaction in models 
      of sleep disturbance was found, but no significant effects were found for other 
      health behaviors. The majority of students in the intervention group reported 
      that Calm was helpful to reduce stress and stated they would use Calm in the 
      future. The majority were satisfied using Calm and likely to recommend it to 
      other college students. The intervention group participated in meditation for an 
      average of 38 minutes/week during the intervention and 20 minutes/week during 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Calm is an effective modality to deliver mindfulness 
      meditation in order to reduce stress and improve mindfulness and self-compassion 
      in stressed college students. Our findings provide important information that can 
      be applied to the design of future studies or mental health resources in 
      university programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03891810;

TI  - Mindfulness meditation and the immune system: a systematic review of randomized 
      controlled trials.
PG  - 13-24
LID - 10.1111/nyas.12998 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness meditation represents a mental training framework for cultivating the 
      state of mindful awareness in daily life. Recently, there has been a surge of 
      interest in how mindfulness meditation improves human health and well-being. 
      Although studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can improve self-reported 
      measures of disease symptomatology, the effect that mindfulness meditation has on 
      biological mechanisms underlying human aging and disease is less clear. To 
      address this issue, we conducted the first comprehensive review of randomized 
      controlled trials examining the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune 
      system parameters, with a specific focus on five outcomes: (1) circulating and 
      stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular transcription factors and gene 
      expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and (5) antibody 
      response. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across studies with 
      respect to patient population, study design, and assay procedures. The findings 
      suggest possible effects of mindfulness meditation on specific markers of 
      inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and biological aging, but these results are 
      tentative and require further replication. On the basis of this analysis, we 
      describe the limitations of existing work and suggest possible avenues for future 
      research. Mindfulness meditation may be salutogenic for immune system dynamics, 
      but additional work is needed to examine these effects.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with chronic, 
      treatment-resistant depression: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 914-924
LID - 10.1002/da.22788 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic and treatment-resistant depressions pose serious problems in 
      mental health care. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an effective 
      treatment for remitted and currently depressed patients. It is, however, unknown 
      whether MBCT is effective for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients. 
      METHOD: A pragmatic, multicenter, randomized-controlled trial was conducted 
      comparing treatment-as-usual (TAU) with MBCT + TAU in 106 chronically depressed 
      outpatients who previously received pharmacotherapy (≥4 weeks) and psychological 
      treatment (≥10 sessions). RESULTS: Based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
      analysis, participants in the MBCT + TAU condition did not have significantly 
      fewer depressive symptoms than those in the TAU condition (-3.23 [-6.99 to 0.54], 
      d = 0.35, P = 0.09) at posttreatment. However, compared to TAU, the MBCT + TAU 
      group reported significantly higher remission rates (χ(2) (2) = 4.25, φ = 0.22, 
      P = 0.04), lower levels of rumination (-3.85 [-7.55 to -0.15], d = 0.39, 
      P = 0.04), a higher quality of life (4.42 [0.03-8.81], d = 0.42, P = 0.048), more 
      mindfulness skills (11.25 [6.09-16.40], d = 0.73, P < 0.001), and more 
      self-compassion (2.91 [1.17-4.65], d = 0.64, P = 0.001). The percentage of 
      non-completers in the MBCT + TAU condition was relatively high (n = 12, 24.5%). 
      Per-protocol analyses revealed that those who completed MBCT + TAU had 
      significantly fewer depressive symptoms at posttreatment compared to participants 
      receiving TAU (-4.24 [-8.38 to -0.11], d = 0.45, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Although 
      the ITT analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in depressive symptoms of 
      MBCT + TAU over TAU, MBCT + TAU seems to have beneficial effects for chronic, 
      treatment-resistant depressed patients in terms of remission rates, rumination, 
      quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Additionally, patients 
      who completed MBCT showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Reasons 
      for non-completion should be further investigated.

TI  - Research Review: The effects of mindfulness-based interventions on cognition and 
      mental health in children and adolescents - a meta-analysis of randomized 
      controlled trials.
PG  - 244-258
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12980 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are an increasingly popular 
      way of attempting to improve the behavioural, cognitive and mental health 
      outcomes of children and adolescents, though there is a suggestion that 
      enthusiasm has moved ahead of the evidence base. Most evaluations of MBIs are 
      either uncontrolled or nonrandomized trials. This meta-analysis aims to establish 
      the efficacy of MBIs for children and adolescents in studies that have adopted a 
      randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design. METHODS: A systematic literature 
      search of RCTs of MBIs was conducted up to October 2017. Thirty-three independent 
      studies including 3,666 children and adolescents were included in random effects 
      meta-analyses with outcome measures categorized into cognitive, behavioural and 
      emotional factors. Separate random effects meta-analyses were completed for the 
      seventeen studies (n = 1,762) that used an RCT design with an active control 
      condition. RESULTS: Across all RCTs we found significant positive effects of 
      MBIs, relative to controls, for the outcome categories of Mindfulness, Executive 
      Functioning, Attention, Depression, Anxiety/Stress and Negative Behaviours, with 
      small effect sizes (Cohen's d), ranging from .16 to .30. However, when 
      considering only those RCTs with active control groups, significant benefits of 
      an MBI were restricted to the outcomes of Mindfulness (d = .42), Depression 
      (d = .47) and Anxiety/Stress (d = .18) only. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis 
      reinforces the efficacy of using MBIs for improving the mental health and 
      wellbeing of youth as assessed using the gold standard RCT methodology. Future 
      RCT evaluations should incorporate scaled-up definitive trial designs to further 
      evaluate the robustness of MBIs in youth, with an embedded focus on mechanisms of 
      action.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness meditation has met increasing interest as a therapeutic 
      strategy for anxiety disorders, but prior studies have been limited by 
      methodological concerns, including a lack of an active comparison group. This is 
      the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the manualized Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) program with an active control for generalized anxiety 
      disorder (GAD), a disorder characterized by chronic worry and physiologic 
      hyperarousal symptoms. METHOD: Ninety-three individuals with DSM-IV-diagnosed GAD 
      were randomly assigned to an 8-week group intervention with MBSR or to an 
      attention control, Stress Management Education (SME), between 2009 and 2011. 
      Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA; 
      primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and 
      -Improvement scales (CGI-S and CGI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). 
      Stress reactivity was assessed by comparing anxiety and distress during 
      pretreatment and posttreatment administration of the Trier Social Stress Test 
      (TSST). RESULTS: A modified intent-to-treat analysis including participants who 
      completed at least 1 session of MBSR (n = 48) or SME (n = 41) showed that both 
      interventions led to significant (P < .0001) reductions in HAMA scores at 
      endpoint, but did not significantly differ. MBSR, however, was associated with a 
      significantly greater reduction in anxiety as measured by the CGI-S, the CGI-I, 
      and the BAI (all P values < .05). MBSR was also associated with greater 
      reductions than SME in anxiety and distress ratings in response to the TSST 
      stress challenge (P < .05) and a greater increase in positive self-statements (P 
      = .004). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MBSR may have a beneficial 
      effect on anxiety symptoms in GAD and may also improve stress reactivity and 
      coping as measured in a laboratory stress challenge. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delivered in person, yoga is effective in managing irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The evidence for efficacy, feasibility, and safety of 
      virtually delivered yoga for patients with IBS is unknown. METHODS: Adults 
      diagnosed with IBS were randomized to either Hatha yoga intervention of 8 weekly 
      online classes delivered virtually or an advice-only control group and assessed 
      at baseline and postintervention. We used an unadjusted ANOVA to determine 
      differences between and within groups on the primary outcome (decrease of ≥50 
      points in IBS Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS]) and secondary outcomes (quality 
      of life, anxiety and depression, fatigue, somatic symptoms, perceived stress, 
      COVID-19 stress, and self-compassion). We assessed feasibility through 
      recruitment and attrition rates, adherence, participant satisfaction, and safety 
      (i.e., adverse events). RESULTS: Seventy-nine people participated (mean age 45.4 
      years [SD = 14.0], 92% women, 20% attrition rate). IBS-SSS decreased 
      significantly in the treatment group (Δ change = 54.7, P = 0.028), but not in the 
      control group (Δ change = 22.6, P = 0.277). Fourteen patients (37%) in the yoga 
      group reached a clinically relevant decrease of ≥50 points on the IBS-SSS 
      postintervention compared with 8 patients (20%) in the control group ( P = 
      0.242). No significant difference was found between groups in IBS-SSS score 
      postintervention ( P = 0.149), but significant differences in favor of the 
      treatment group for quality of life ( P = 0.030), fatigue ( P = 0.035), and 
      perceived stress ( P = 0.040) were identified. The yoga program demonstrated 
      feasibility. Intention to practice yoga decreased significantly in both groups 
      from baseline to postintervention ( P < 0.001). However, the decline in intention 
      did not correlate with practice minutes. DISCUSSION: Virtually delivered yoga is 
      safe and feasible, and effective in reducing IBS symptoms. Based on the primary 
      end point, the intervention was not superior to an advice-only control group.

TI  - Preventing Postpartum Depression With Mindful Self-Compassion Intervention: A 
      Randomized Control Study.
PG  - 101-107
LID - 10.1097/NMD.0000000000001096 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness and self-compassion are reported to have a preventive effects on 
      depression and anxiety disorders. In the present study, we aimed to assess the 
      effect of mindful self-compassion intervention on preventing postpartum 
      depression in a group of symptomatic pregnant women. Participants were screened 
      and assigned to the intervention and control groups randomly. A 6-week 
      Internet-based Mindful Self-Compassion Program was used to train the 
      participants. Multiple scales were used to assess depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms, mindfulness, self-compassion, and mother and infant well-being. All 
      assessments were performed at three time points: baseline, 3 months, and 1 year 
      postpartum. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed 
      significant improvement in depressive and anxiety behaviors. In addition, the 
      intervention group became more mindful and self-compassionate at 3 months and 1 
      year postpartum. More importantly, both mothers and infants experienced 
      substantial improvement in well-being. Our findings indicate that mindful 
      self-compassion intervention is effective in preventing postpartum depression and 
      promoting mother and infant well-being.

TI  - 'Mindful eating' for reducing emotional eating in patients with overweight or 
      obesity in primary care settings: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 303-319
LID - 10.1002/erv.2958 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of a 
      'mindful eating' programme for reducing emotional eating in patients with 
      overweight or obesity. METHOD: A cluster randomized controlled trial (reg. 
      NCT03927534) was conducted with 76 participants with overweight/obesity who were 
      assigned to 'mindful eating' (7 weeks) + treatment as usual (TAU), or to TAU 
      alone. They were assessed at baseline, posttreatment and 12-month follow-up. The 
      main outcome was 'emotional eating' (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, DEBQ); 
      other eating behaviours were also assessed along with psychological and 
      physiological variables. RESULTS: 'Mindful eating' + TAU reduced emotional eating 
      both at posttreatment (B = -0.27; p = 0.006; d = 0.35) and follow-up (B = -0.53; 
      p < 0.001; d = 0.69) compared to the control group (TAU alone). 'External eating' 
      (DEBQ) was also significantly improved by the intervention at both timepoints. 
      Significant effects at follow-up were observed for some secondary outcomes 
      related to bulimic behaviours, mindful eating, mindfulness, and self-compassion. 
      Weight and other physiological parameters were not significantly affected by 
      'mindful eating' + TAU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the efficacy of the 
      'mindful eating' + TAU programme for reducing emotional and external eating, 
      along with some other secondary measures, but no significant changes in weight 
      reduction were observed.

TI  - Health Care Workers' Need for Headspace: Findings From a Multisite Definitive 
      Randomized Controlled Trial of an Unguided Digital Mindfulness-Based Self-help 
      App to Reduce Healthcare Worker Stress.
PG  - e31744

LID - e31744
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care workers experience high stress. Accessible, affordable, 
      and effective approaches to reducing stress are lacking. In-person 
      mindfulness-based interventions can reduce health care worker stress but are not 
      widely available or accessible to busy health care workers. Unguided, digital, 
      mindfulness-based self-help (MBSH) interventions show promise and can be flexibly 
      engaged with. However, their effectiveness in reducing health care worker stress 
      has not yet been explored in a definitive trial. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      investigate the effectiveness of an unguided digital MBSH app (Headspace) in 
      reducing health care worker stress. METHODS: This was a definitive superiority 
      randomized controlled trial with 2182 National Health Service staff in England 
      recruited on the web and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to fully automated Headspace 
      (n=1095, 50.18%) or active control (Moodzone; n=1087, 49.82%) for 4.5 months. 
      Outcomes were subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (primary outcome) 
      Scale short form; Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; Maslach 
      Burnout Inventory; 15-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire minus Observe 
      items; Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form; Compassionate Love Scale; Penn State 
      Worry Questionnaire; Brooding subscale of the Ruminative Response Scale; and 
      sickness absence. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses found that Headspace led 
      to greater reductions in stress over time than Moodzone (b=-0.31, 95% CI -0.47 to 
      -0.14; P<.001), with small effects. Small effects of Headspace versus Moodzone 
      were found for depression (b=-0.24, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.08; P=.003), anxiety 
      (b=-0.19, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.06; P=.004), well-being (b=0.14, 95% CI 0.05-0.23; 
      P=.002), mindfulness (b=0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.34; P=.001), self-compassion (b=0.48, 
      95% CI 0.33-0.64; P<.001), compassion for others (b=0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.04; 
      P=.04), and worry (b=-0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.09; P=.005) but not for burnout 
      (b=-0.19, -0.04, and 0.13, all 95% CIs >0; P=.65, .67, and .35), ruminative 
      brooding (b=-0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.00; P=.06), or sickness absence (γ=0.09, 95% 
      CI -0.18 to 0.34). Per-protocol effects of Headspace (454/1095, 41.46%) versus 
      Moodzone (283/1087, 26.03%) over time were found for stress, self-compassion, and 
      compassion for others but not for the other outcomes. Engagement (practice days 
      per week) and improvements in self-compassion during the initial 1.5-month 
      intervention period mediated pre- to postintervention improvements in stress. 
      Improvements in mindfulness, rumination, and worry did not mediate pre- to 
      postintervention improvements in stress. No serious adverse events were reported. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An unguided digital MBSH intervention (Headspace) can reduce health 
      care workers' stress. Effect sizes were small but could have population-level 
      benefits. Unguided digital MBSH interventions can be part of the solution to 
      reducing health care worker stress alongside potentially costlier but potentially 
      more effective in-person mindfulness-based interventions, nonmindfulness courses, 
      and organizational-level interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of these two studies was to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
      Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program, an 8-week workshop designed to train 
      people to be more self-compassionate. METHODS: Study 1 was a pilot study that 
      examined change scores in self-compassion, mindfulness, and various wellbeing 
      outcomes among community adults (N = 21; mean [M] age = 51.26, 95% female). Study 
      2 was a randomized controlled trial that compared a treatment group (N = 25; M 
      age = 51.21; 78% female) with a waitlist control group (N = 27; M age = 49.11; 
      82% female). RESULTS: Study 1 found significant pre/post gains in 
      self-compassion, mindfulness, and various wellbeing outcomes. Study 2 found that 
      compared with the control group, intervention participants reported significantly 
      larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, and wellbeing. Gains were 
      maintained at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The MSC program appears 
      to be effective at enhancing self-compassion, mindfulness, and wellbeing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distress and burnout among medical and psychology professionals are 
      commonly reported and have implications for the quality of patient care 
      delivered. Already in the course of university studies, medicine and psychology 
      students report mental distress and low life satisfaction. There is a need for 
      interventions that promote better coping skills in students in order to prevent 
      distress and future burnout. This study examines the effect of a seven-week 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme on mental distress, study 
      stress, burnout, subjective well-being, and mindfulness of medical and psychology 
      students. METHODS: A total of 288 students (mean age = 23 years, 76% female) from 
      the University of Oslo and the University of Tromsø were randomly allocated to an 
      intervention or control group. The control group continued with their standard 
      university courses and received no intervention. Participants were evaluated 
      using self-reported measures both before and after the intervention. These were: 
      the 'General Health Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory Student version, 
      Perceived Medical School Stress, Subjective Well-being, and Five Facet 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire' and additional indices of compliance. RESULTS: 
      Following the intervention, a moderate effect on mental distress (Hedges'g 0.65, 
      CI = .41, .88), and a small effect on both subjective well-being (Hedges'g 0.40, 
      CI = .27, .63) and the mindfulness facet 'non-reacting' (Hedges'g 0.33, CI = .10, 
      .56) were found in the intervention group compared with the control group. A 
      higher level of programme attendance and reported mindfulness exercises predicted 
      these changes. Significant effects were only found for female students who 
      additionally reported reduced study stress and an increase in the mindfulness 
      facet 'non-judging'. Gender specific effects of participation in the MBSR 
      programme have not previously been reported, and gender differences in the 
      present study are discussed. CONCLUSION: Female medical and psychology students 
      experienced significant positive improvements in mental distress, study stress, 
      subjective well-being and mindfulness after participating in the MBSR programme.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness Versus Yoga: Effects on Depression 
      and/or Anxiety in College Students.
PG  - 483-497
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders are two of the most common mental 
      disorders in the United States. These disorders are prevalent among college 
      students. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to compare the 
      effectiveness of two different types of intervention practices (mindfulness vs. 
      yoga) and a noninterventional control group in mitigating the effects of 
      depression and/or anxiety in college students. METHOD: A sample of 90 students 
      (both genders) over age 18 who had a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression was 
      recruited from 11,500 undergraduate college students in a mid-size university. 
      The study's design included stratified-randomized controlled repeated measures 
      with three groups: a mindfulness intervention group, a yoga-only intervention 
      group, and a noninterventional group. Participants were randomly assigned to the 
      aforementioned three groups. Participants in the intervention groups received an 
      8-week training either in mindfulness or yoga. Depressive, anxiety, stress 
      symptoms, self-compassion, and mindfulness were measured at baseline, Week 4, 
      Week 8, and Week 12. RESULTS: Depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms decreased 
      significantly (p < .01) from baseline to follow-up conditions in both the 
      mindfulness and yoga intervention groups. The changes in mindfulness scores were 
      also significant in both groups. However, the changes in self-compassion scores 
      were significant only in the mindfulness intervention group. No significant 
      changes in the control group were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from 
      this study can provide useful information to nurses and other health care 
      providers. This study may have implications for a cost-effective treatment for 
      depression and anxiety.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial (MindChamp) of a mindfulness-based intervention for 
      children with ADHD and their parents.
PG  - 165-177
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.13430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for child 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) targets child self-control, 
      parenting and parental mental health, but its effectiveness is still unclear. 
      METHODS: MindChamp is a pre-registered randomised controlled trial comparing an 
      8-week family MBI (called 'MYmind') in addition to care-as-usual (CAU) (n = 55) 
      with CAU-only (n = 48). Children aged 8-16 years with remaining ADHD symptoms 
      after CAU were enrolled together with a parent. Primary outcome was 
      post-treatment parent-rated child self-control deficits (BRIEF); post hoc, 
      Reliable Change Indexes were explored. Secondary child outcomes included ADHD 
      symptoms (parent/teacher-rated Conners' and SWAN; teacher-rated BRIEF), other 
      psychological symptoms (parent/teacher-rated), well-being (parent-rated) and 
      mindfulness (self-rated). Secondary parent outcomes included self-ratings of ADHD 
      symptoms, other psychological symptoms, well-being, self-compassion and mindful 
      parenting. Assessments were conducted at post-treatment, 2- and 6-month 
      follow-up. RESULTS: Relative to CAU-only, MBI+CAU resulted in a small, 
      statistically non-significant post-treatment improvement on the BRIEF 
      (intention-to-treat: d = 0.27, p = .18; per protocol: d = 0.33, p = .11). 
      Significantly more children showed reliable post-treatment improvement following 
      MBI+CAU versus CAU-only (32% versus 11%, p < .05, Number-Needed-to-Treat = 4.7). 
      ADHD symptoms significantly reduced post-treatment according to parent (Conners' 
      and SWAN) and teacher ratings (BRIEF) per protocol. Only parent-rated 
      hyperactivity impulsivity (SWAN) remained significantly reduced at 6-month 
      follow-up. Post-treatment group differences on other secondary child outcomes 
      were consistently favour of MBI+CAU, but mostly non-significant; no significant 
      differences were found at follow-ups. Regarding parent outcomes, significant 
      post-treatment improvements were found for their own ADHD symptoms, well-being 
      and mindful parenting. At follow-ups, some significant effects remained (ADHD 
      symptoms, mindful parenting), some additional significant effects appeared (other 
      psychological symptoms, self-compassion) and others disappeared/remained 
      non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Family MBI+CAU did not outperform CAU-only in 
      reducing child self-control deficits on a group level but more children reliably 
      improved. Effects on parents were larger and more durable. When CAU for ADHD is 
      insufficient, family MBI could be a valuable addition.

TI  - Efficacy of Integrated Online Mindfulness and Self-compassion Training for Adults 
      With Atopic Dermatitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 628-636
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2023.0975 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Quality of life (QOL) of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is 
      reported to be the lowest among skin diseases. To our knowledge, mindfulness and 
      self-compassion training has not been evaluated for adults with AD. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness and self-compassion training in improving 
      the QOL for adults with AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized 
      clinical trial conducted from March 2019 through October 2022 included adults 
      with AD whose Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score, a skin 
      disease-specific QOL measure, was greater than 6 (corresponding to moderate or 
      greater impairment). Participants were recruited from multiple outpatient 
      institutes in Japan and through the study's social media outlets and website. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive eight 90-minute weekly 
      group sessions of online mindfulness and self-compassion training or to a waiting 
      list. Both groups were allowed to receive any dermatologic treatment except 
      dupilumab. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in the 
      DLQI score from baseline to week 13. Secondary outcomes included eczema severity, 
      itch- and scratching-related visual analog scales, self-compassion and all of its 
      subscales, mindfulness, psychological symptoms, and participants' adherence to 
      dermatologist-advised treatments. RESULTS: The study randomized 107 adults to the 
      intervention group (n = 56) or the waiting list (n = 51). The overall participant 
      mean (SD) age was 36.3 (10.5) years, 85 (79.4%) were women, and the mean (SD) AD 
      duration was 26.6 (11.7) years. Among participants from the intervention group, 
      55 (98.2%) attended 6 or more of the 8 sessions, and 105 of all participants 
      (98.1%) completed the assessment at 13 weeks. The intervention group demonstrated 
      greater improvement in the DLQI score at 13 weeks (between-group difference 
      estimate, -6.34; 95% CI, -8.27 to -4.41; P < .001). The standardized effect size 
      (Cohen d) at 13 weeks was -1.06 (95% CI, -1.39 to -0.74). All secondary outcomes 
      showed greater improvements in the intervention group than in the waiting list 
      group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of adults 
      with AD, integrated online mindfulness and self-compassion training in addition 
      to usual care resulted in greater improvement in skin disease-specific QOL and 
      other patient-reported outcomes, including eczema severity. These findings 
      suggest that mindfulness and self-compassion training is an effective treatment 
      option for adults with AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to study the effect of mindfulness-based program on 
      the psychological, biomechanical and inflammatory domains of patients with 
      chronic low back pain. METHODS: A multicentre randomized and controlled clinical 
      trial of parallel groups in patients with chronic low back pain between March 
      2019 to March 2020. Participants with no experience in mindfulness based 
      intervention, were randomized to receive (36 patients) or not (34 patients) 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction program for chronic back pain (MBSR-CBP). The 
      program was performed in 9 sessions. Patients with chronic low back pain due to 
      symptomatic discopathy (degenerative disc disease or herniated disc) were 
      included. The principal outcome was changes in the blood level of cortisol and 
      cytokines (tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)). Secondary outcomes 
      (psychological factors, pain, and quality of life) were measured by validated 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 96 randomized patients, 70 who completed the 
      study were included in the analysis (mean [range] age: 53 [33-73] years; 66% 
      females). MBSR-CBP stopped the increase in cortisol, and reduced pro-inflammatory 
      cytokine IL-1β (p = 0.05). It reduced depression (p = 0.046) and stress (p = 
      0.0438), perceived pain (p &lt; 0.0001), and limitations related to health (p 
      &lt; 0.0001). It also increased the physical function (p = 0.002) and sleep 
      quality (p = 0.05). Furthermore, it significantly increased life satisfaction 
      (0.006), well-being (p = 0.001) and vitality (p &lt; 0.0001). It also increased 
      self-compassion (p &lt; 0.0001) and significantly reduced the overidentification 
      (p&lt;0.0001) and catastrophization (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: MBSR-CBP could be 
      part of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of patients suffering from 
      chronic low back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health personnel are susceptible to high levels of work stress and 
      burnout due to the psychological and emotional demands of their work, as well as 
      to other aspects related to the organisation of that work. This paper describes 
      the rationale and design of the MINDUUDD study, the aim of which is to evaluate 
      the effectiveness of a mindfulness and self-compassion 4-session programme versus 
      the standard 8-session programme to reduce work stress and burnout in Family and 
      Community Medicine and Nursing tutors and residents. METHODS: The MINDUDD study 
      is a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms. 
      Six Teaching Units will be randomised to one of the three study groups: 1) 
      Experimental Group-8 (EG8); 2) Experimental Group-4 (EG4) Control group (CG). At 
      least 132 subjects will participate (66 tutors/66 residents), 44 in the EG8, 44 
      in the EG4, and 44 in the CG. Interventions will be based on the 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, including some self-compassion 
      practices of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) programme. The EG8 intervention 
      will be implemented during 8 weekly face-to-face sessions of 2.5 h each, while 
      the EG4 intervention will consist of 4 sessions of 2.5 h each. The participants 
      will have to practice at home for 30 min/day in the EG8 and 15 min/day in the 
      EG4. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale 
      (SCS), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), 
      Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), and Goldberg Anxiety-Depression 
      Scale (GADS) will be administered. Measurements will be taken at baseline, at the 
      end of the programs, and at three months after completion. The effect of the 
      interventions will be evaluated by bivariate and multivariate analyses (Multiple 
      Linear Regression). DISCUSSION: If the abbreviated mindfulness programme is at 
      least as effective as the standard program, its incorporation into the curriculum 
      and training plans will be easier and more appropriate. It will also be more 
      easily applied and accepted by primary care professionals because of the reduced 
      resources and means required for its implementation, and it may also extend 
      beyond care settings to academic and teaching environments as well. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: The study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03629457 ; 
      date of registration: 13.08.2018).

      NCT03025139). METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before 50 years 
      of age who had completed treatment and had elevated depressive symptoms were 
      randomly assigned to 6 weeks of MAPs, SE, or wait-list control (WLC). Assessments 
      were conducted preintervention and postintervention and at 3-month and 6-month 
      postintervention follow-ups. Analyses compared each intervention to WLC using 
      linear mixed models. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms from 
      preintervention to postintervention on the Center for Epidemiologic 
      Studies-Depression Scale; secondary outcomes included change in fatigue, 
      insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven women (median 
      age = 46 years) were randomly assigned to MAPs (n = 85), SE (n = 81), or WLC (n = 
      81). MAPs and SE led to significant decreases in depressive symptoms from 
      preintervention to postintervention relative to WLC (mean change relative to WLC 
      [95% CI]: MAPs, -4.7 [-7.5 to -1.9]; SE, -4.0 [-6.9 to -1.1]), which persisted at 
      6-month follow-up for MAPs (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, -3.7 
      [-6.6 to -0.8]; SE, -2.8 [-5.9 to 0.2]). MAPs, but not SE, also had beneficial 
      effects on fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms that persisted at 6-month 
      follow-up (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness meditation and SE reduced depressive 
      symptoms in younger breast cancer survivors. These interventions can be widely 
      disseminated over virtual platforms and have significant potential benefit for 
      quality of life and overall survivorship in this vulnerable group.

TI  - Caring for the caregivers: Evaluation of the effect of an eight-week pilot

      resilience.
PG  - e0207261

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses vicariously exposed to the suffering of those in their care 
      are at risk of compassion fatigue. Emerging research suggests that 
      self-compassion interventions may provide protective factors and enhance 
      resilience. This pilot study examined the effect of an eight-week Mindful 
      Self-Compassion (MSC) training intervention on nurses' compassion fatigue and 
      resilience and participants' lived experience of the effect of the training. 
      METHODS: This observational mixed research pilot study adopted an evaluation 
      design framework. It comprised of a single group and evaluated the effects of a 
      pilot MSC intervention by analyzing the pre- and post-change scores in 
      self-compassion, mindfulness, secondary trauma, burnout, compassion satisfaction, 
      and resilience. The sample of the nurses' (N = 13) written responses to the 
      question, "How did you experience the effect of this pilot MSC training?" were 
      also analyzed. RESULTS: The Pre- to Post- scores of secondary trauma and burnout 
      declined significantly and were negatively associated with self-compassion (r = 
      -.62, p = .02) (r = -.55, p = .05) and mindfulness (r = -.54, p = .05). (r = 
      -.60, p = .03), respectively. Resilience and compassion satisfaction scores 
      increased. All variables demonstrated a large effect size: Mean (M) Cohen's d = 
      1.23. The qualitative emergent themes corroborated the quantitative findings and 
      expanded the understanding about how MSC on the job practices enhanced nurses' 
      coping. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the effect of a pilot 
      (MSC) training program on nurses' compassion fatigue and resilience in this new 
      area of research. It provides some preliminary empirical evidence in support of 
      the theorized benefits of self-compassion training for nurses. However, further 
      research, such as a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with a larger sample size and 
      a longitudinal study, is required to see if the benefits of self-compassion 
      training are sustainable.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the applicability of mindfulness-based 
      interventions in Spanish adults with overweight/obesity. The objective of the 
      present study protocol is to describe the methods that will be used in a cluster 
      randomised trial (CRT) that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness 
      eating (ME) programme to reduce emotional eating (EE) in adults with 
      overweight/obesity in primary care (PC) settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A CRT 
      will be conducted with approximately 76 adults with overweight/obesity from four 
      PC health centres (clusters) in the city of Zaragoza, Spain. Health centres 
      matched to the average per capita income of the assigned population will be 
      randomly allocated into two groups: 'ME +treatment as usual (TAU)' and 'TAU 
      alone'. The ME programme will be composed of seven sessions delivered by a 
      clinical psychologist, and TAU will be offered by general practitioners. The 
      primary outcome will be EE measured by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire 
      (DEBQ) at post test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be external and 
      restrained eating (DEBQ), binge eating (Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh), 
      eating disorder (Eating Attitude Test), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), 
      depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), mindful eating (Mindful Eating 
      Scale), dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and 
      self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale). Anthropometric measures, vital signs and 
      blood tests will be taken. A primary intention-to-treat analysis on EE will be 
      conducted using linear mixed models. Supplementary analyses will include 
      secondary outcomes and 1-year follow-up measures; adjusted models controlling for 
      sex, weight status and levels of anxiety and depression; the complier average 
      causal effect of treatment; and the clinical significance of improvements. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: Positive results of this study may have a significant impact 
      on one of the most important current health-related problems. Approval was 
      obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Regional Authority. The results will be 
      submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and reports will be sent to participants.

TI  - Acceptance and commitment therapy versus mindfulness-based stress reduction for 
      newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients: A randomized controlled trial 
      assessing efficacy for positive psychology, depression, anxiety, and quality of 
      life.
PG  - e0267887
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0267887 [doi]
LID - e0267887
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Head and neck cancer patients are vulnerable to various 
      psychological complications due to the effects of both cancer itself and cancer 
      treatment on patients' appearance and physical well-being. Nevertheless, few data 
      have been obtained on effective psychosocial interventions that could protect 
      this group of cancer patients' psychological well-being. Therefore, this 
      three-armed, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) aims to 
      evaluate and compare the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive psychology (such as 
      posttraumatic growth [PTG], hope, and optimism), quality of life (QoL), and 
      psychological complications (depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance) 
      among newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 
      RCT will target newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been 
      treated only with surgery or who have not yet received any treatment. In total, 
      120 patients who meet all of the study's inclusion criteria and none of its 
      exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into three groups-an ACT group, an 
      MBSR group, and a treatment-as-usual control group-at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. 
      Participants in the two intervention groups (the ACT and MBSR groups) will 
      undergo an eight-week group intervention program. During this program, each 
      intervention will comprise eight modules based on ACT and MBSR, respectively. 
      Outcome assessments will be performed across a three-point timeline, including 
      before the intervention (t0), immediately after the psychosocial intervention at 
      eight weeks (t1), and six months after the intervention (t2). The primary outcome 
      that will be assessed during this RCT is PTG. Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes 
      that will be evaluated in this study are such as QoL, hope, optimism, depression, 
      anxiety, and experiential avoidance. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04800419

AB  - An experiment involving 115 undergraduate students (74.8% females; mean 
      age = 20.5 years, SD = 4.3) was conducted to explore effects of meditation on 
      social connectedness, nature connectedness, and affect. Participants listened to 
      one of three brief guided meditation Mp3 recordings via the internet, which 
      involved mindfulness meditation (MM), loving-kindness meditation (LKM), or 
      progressive muscle relaxation (active control group). Participants in the MM and 
      LKM groups reported greater social and nature connectedness at post-test than 
      those in the control group. There were no significant differences in 
      connectedness between the MM and LKM groups, suggesting they are both effective 
      for enhancing connectedness. There were no significant changes in negative or 
      positive affect at post-test due to the interventions. Recommendations for future 
      research are provided.

AB  - While it has been suggested that loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is an effective 
      practice for promoting positive emotions, the empirical evidence in the 
      literature remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic review of 24 empirical 
      studies (N = 1759) on LKM with self-reported positive emotions. The effect of LKM 
      on positive emotions was estimated with meta-analysis, and the influence of 
      variations across LKM interventions was further explored with subgroup analysis 
      and meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed that (1) medium effect sizes for 
      LKM interventions on daily positive emotions in both wait-list controlled RCTs 
      and non-RCT studies; and (2) small to large effect sizes for the on-going 
      practice of LKM on immediate positive emotions across different comparisons. 
      Further analysis showed that (1) interventions focused on loving-kindness had 
      medium effect size, but interventions focused on compassion showed small effect 
      sizes; (2) the length of interventions and the time spent on meditation did not 
      influence the effect sizes, but the studies without didactic components in 
      interventions had small effect sizes. A few individual studies reported that the 
      nature of positive emotions and individual differences also influenced the 
      results. In sum, LKM practice and interventions are effective in enhancing 
      positive emotions, but more studies are needed to identify the active components 
      of the interventions, to compare different psychological operations, and to 
      explore the applicability in clinical populations.

AB  - There is currently limited research examining self-structure in clinical groups 
      and no current data on the extent to which self-structure is amendable to change 
      following psychological therapy. We address this important gap by examining 
      self-structure in individuals with persecutory delusions using the card sort 
      task, an established paradigm measuring key self-structure indices, including the 
      degree to which self-structure is compartmentalized (characterized by primarily 
      positive or negative attributes, as opposed to a mix of both), and the proportion 
      and importance of negative attributes. In Study 1, individuals with a 
      schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis with current persecutory delusions (clinical 
      group, n = 27) and a healthy control group (n = 47) were compared on 
      self-structure indices. In Study 2 (n = 27), the clinical group also completed 
      the card sort task before and after randomization to either a 12-week 
      mindfulness-based psychological therapy or treatment-as-usual control. In Study 
      1, self-structure differed significantly between the clinical and control groups. 
      The clinical group had a greater proportion of negative attributes, assigned more 
      importance to negative self-aspects, and had more compartmentalized 
      self-structures compared with controls. In Study 2 there were no associations 
      between delusion severity and self-structure. Large effect sizes for reductions 
      in compartmentalization and proportion of negative attributes across self-aspects 
      were found following mindfulness therapy. The findings highlight key differences 
      in self-structure between individuals with persecutory delusions and healthy 
      controls, and suggest that it might be possible to change self-structure 
      following psychological therapy. These data support the central role of the self 
      in theoretical models of paranoid thinking.

      research and practice.
PG  - 432-455
LID - 10.1111/papt.12104 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Over the last 10-15 years, there has been a substantive increase in 
      compassion-based interventions aiming to improve psychological functioning and 
      well-being. METHODS: This study provides an overview and synthesis of the 
      currently available compassion-based interventions. What do these programmes 
      looks like, what are their aims, and what is the state of evidence underpinning 
      each of them? RESULTS: This overview has found at least eight different 
      compassion-based interventions (e.g., Compassion-Focused Therapy, Mindful 
      Self-Compassion, Cultivating Compassion Training, Cognitively Based Compassion 
      Training), with six having been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, and 
      with a recent meta-analysis finding that compassion-based interventions produce 
      moderate effect sizes for suffering and improved life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although further research is warranted, the current state of evidence highlights 
      the potential benefits of compassion-based interventions on a range of outcomes 
      that clinicians can use in clinical practice with clients. PRACTITIONER POINTS: 
      There are eight established compassion intervention programmes with six having 
      RCT evidence. The most evaluated intervention to date is compassion-focused 
      therapy. Further RCTs are needed in clinical populations for all compassion 
      interventions. Ten recommendations are provided to improve the evidence-base of 
      compassion interventions.

PG  - 261-272
LID - 10.1177/0193945920924608 [doi]
AB  - Positive airway pressure (PAP) associated claustrophobia is common among 
      obstructive sleep apnea patients and plays a prominent role in low adherence and 
      treatment failure. As there are no evidence-based interventions for 
      PAP-associated claustrophobia, the objective of the present research is to pilot 
      test Mindfulness-based Exposure for PAP-associated Claustrophobia, in sleep apnea 
      adults that present with treatment non-adherence and claustrophobia. This 
      approach combines Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction with exposure-based 
      treatment components to target this treatment-associated claustrophobia. The 
      present article outlines the mindfulness exposure intervention design and methods 
      and reports the pilot trial study protocol. Trial findings are intended to: (a) 
      develop a preliminary effect size of the intervention on PAP-associated 
      claustrophobia; (b) explore differences in treatment adherence by group 
      (intervention vs control); and (c) establish feasibility for expanded protocol 
      implementation, delivery, and participant acceptability of the intervention to 
      support subsequent design of a fully powered randomized controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Physicians and medical students are subject to higher levels of 
      psychological distress than the general population. These challenges have a 
      negative impact in medical practice, leading to uncompassionate care. This pilot 
      study aims to examine the feasibility of Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) to 
      reduce psychological distress and improve the well-being of medical students. We 
      hypothesize that the CCT program, as compared to a waitlist control group, will 
      reduce psychological distress (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depression) and burnout 
      symptoms, while improving compassion, empathy, mindfulness, resilience, 
      psychological well-being, and emotion-regulation strategies after the 
      intervention. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these improvements will be 
      maintained at a two-month follow-up. METHODS: Medical students were randomly 
      assigned to an 8-week CCT or a Waitlist control group (WL). They completed 
      self-report assessments at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and a 2-month 
      follow-up. The outcomes measured were compassion, empathy, mindfulness, 
      well-being, resilience, emotional regulation, psychological distress, burnout, 
      and COVID-19 concern. Mixed-effects models and Reliable Change Index were 
      computed. RESULTS: Compared with WL, CCT showed significant improvements in 
      self-compassion, mindfulness, and emotion regulation, as well as a significant 
      decrease in stress, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion component of burnout. 
      Furthermore, some of these effects persisted at follow-up. No adverse effects of 
      meditation practices were found. CONCLUSIONS: CCT enhanced compassion skills 
      while reducing psychological distress in medical students, this being critical to 
      preserving the mental health of physicians while promoting compassionate care for 
      patients. The need for institutions to include this type of training is also 
      discussed.

TI  - School-based mindfulness intervention for depressive symptoms in adolescence: For 
      whom is it most effective?
PG  - 118-132
LID - 10.1002/jad.12011 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of 
      mindfulness-based interventions in alleviating depressive symptoms. A crucial 
      question is, however, whether mindfulness interventions are more effective for 
      some individuals than others, depending on individual characteristics before a 
      mindfulness intervention. We exploratorily investigated whether the effectiveness 
      of school-based mindfulness intervention against depressive symptoms is modified 
      by executive functions, rumination, and emotion regulation among adolescents. 
      METHODS: The longitudinal data included adolescents with at least mild depressive 
      symptoms at the baseline (n = 369, at the 6th-8th grade, 68.4% female) who were 
      randomized into a 9-week school-based mindfulness intervention group, into an 
      active control group receiving relaxation program, or into an inactive control 
      group. Adolescents' executive functions, rumination, and emotion regulation 
      (i.e., acceptance, catastrophizing, and positive reappraisal) were assessed at 
      the baseline; and depressive symptoms at three time points (at the baseline and 
      at 9-week and 6-month follow-ups). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with 
      at least mild depressive symptoms at the baseline, high catastrophizing, high 
      acceptance, and low executive functions were found to increase the effectiveness 
      of mindfulness-based intervention against depressive symptoms. There seemed to be 
      some sex differences. Thus, when aiming to alleviate depressive symptoms, 
      mindfulness-based intervention may possibly be more effective for adolescents 
      with high catastrophizing, high acceptance, and low executive functioning (than 
      for adolescents with the opposite dispositions). However, as this study was 
      exploratory by nature and corrections for multiple testing were not used, the 
      findings must be regarded as preliminary and need confirmation in further 
      studies.

TI  - A randomized controlled feasibility trial of online compassion-focused self-help 
      for psoriasis.
PG  - 955-962
LID - 10.1111/bjd.21020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with psoriasis can experience psychological distress that 
      might be amenable to psychosocial self-help. OBJECTIVES: This study tested the 
      feasibility and acceptability of two theoretically developed self-help 
      interventions designed to reduce feelings of shame and improve quality of life. 
      METHODS: A randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted comprising 130 
      participants with psoriasis who were randomly allocated to receive either 
      compassion-based self-help (n = 65) or mindfulness-based self-help (n = 65), over 
      a 4-week period. Both interventions were provided online. RESULTS: The 
      interventions were found to be acceptable, with over 70% of study completers 
      reporting that they found the materials helpful. Of the 130 participants, 92 
      completed the study, with attrition at 29%. Both interventions showed modest yet 
      statistically significant reductions in shame (Cohen's d = 0.20) and improvements 
      in quality of life (Cohen's d = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Self-help based on compassion 
      and mindfulness is acceptable to users, and can reduce feelings of shame and 
      improve quality of life for people living with psoriasis. What is already known 
      about this topic? Psoriasis can be associated with psychological distress. 
      Various forms of psychological intervention have been tested; however, few 
      compassion based interventions have been developed or trialled. What does this 
      study add? This study demonstrates that compassion-based self-help is acceptable 
      to people with psoriasis. This study provides provisional evidence of 
      effectiveness of compassion based self-help in reducing feelings of shame and 
      improving quality of life for people living with psoriasis.

TI  - Web-Based Self-Compassion Training to Improve the Well-Being of Youth With 
      Chronic Medical Conditions: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e44016
LID - 10.2196/44016 [doi]
LID - e44016
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of young people live with chronic physical conditions 
      (eg, diabetes, asthma, and autoimmune disease) that frequently involve recurrent 
      pain, fatigue, activity limitations, stigma, and isolation. These issues may be 
      exacerbated as young people transition through adolescence. Accordingly, young 
      people with chronic illness are at a high risk of psychological distress. 
      Accessible, evidence-based interventions for young people with chronic illnesses 
      are urgently needed to improve well-being, support adaptation, and enhance daily 
      functioning. Self-compassion, which is an adaptive means of relating to oneself 
      during times of difficulty, is a promising intervention target for this 
      population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the efficacy of a 4-week, 
      self-guided, web-based self-compassion training program for improving well-being 
      among young Australians (aged 16-25 years) living with a chronic medical 
      condition. The primary outcomes were self-compassion, emotion regulation 
      difficulties, and coping; the secondary outcomes were well-being, distress, and 
      quality of life. We also sought to test whether changes in primary outcomes 
      mediated changes in secondary outcomes and gather feedback about the strengths 
      and limitations of the program. METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, 
      parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week, fully automated, 
      web-based self-compassion training program with a waitlist control. Participants 
      were recruited via the internet, and outcomes were self-assessed at 4 (T1) and 12 
      weeks (T2) after the baseline time point via a web-based survey. A mixed methods 
      approach was used to evaluate the program feedback. RESULTS: Overall, 151 
      patients (age: mean 21.15, SD 2.77 years; female patients: n=132, 87.4%) were 
      randomized to the intervention (n=76, 50.3%) and control (n=75, 49.7%) groups. 
      The loss-to-follow-up rate was 47.4%, and program use statistics indicated that 
      only 29% (22/76) of young people in the experimental group completed 100% of the 
      program. The main reported barrier to completion was a lack of time. As 
      anticipated, treatment effects were observed for self-compassion (P=.01; partial 
      η(2)=0.05; small effect); well-being (P≤.001; partial η(2)=0.07; medium effect); 
      and distress (P=.003; partial η(2)=0.054; small-medium effect) at the posttest 
      time point and maintained at follow-up. Contrary to our hypotheses, no 
      intervention effects were observed for emotion regulation difficulties or 
      maladaptive coping strategies. Improvements in adaptive coping were observed at 
      the posttest time point but were not maintained at follow-up. Self-compassion, 
      but not emotion regulation difficulties or coping, mediated the improvements in 
      well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal-contact, web-based self-compassion training can 
      confer mental health benefits on young people with chronic conditions. This group 
      experiences substantial challenges to participation in mental health supports, 
      and program engagement and retention in this trial were suboptimal. Future work 
      should focus on refining the program content, engagement, and delivery to 
      optimize engagement and treatment outcomes for the target group. TRIAL

PG  - 444-460
LID - 10.1080/08870446.2020.1778696 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This project investigated same-day and lagged (i.e., from one day to 
      the next) associations between daily positive affect and three distinct positive 
      health behaviours: physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and meditation. 
      Cross-day analyses also examined the role of positive affect felt during the 
      targeted health behaviours. DESIGN: Secondary data analyses used a 9-week daily 
      diary study in which midlife adults (N = 217) were randomized to learn one of two 
      contemplative practices (i.e., mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness 
      meditation) while reporting nightly on their emotions and health behaviours. 
      RESULTS: Results of same-day analyses revealed positive associations, both 
      between-person and within-person, for the three positive health behaviours with 
      daily positive affect. Results of lagged analyses revealed that positive affect 
      experienced during fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day 
      fruit and vegetable intake, and that fruit and vegetable intake on a given day 
      predicted next-day positive affect. CONCLUSION: The observed same-day relations 
      between daily positive affect and engagement in positive health behaviours 
      illuminate one path through which positive affect may contribute to health. The 
      observed cross-day relations reveal a need for interdisciplinary research on 
      mechanisms through which fruit and vegetable intake may shape next-day positive 
      affect.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Scientific research into compassion has burgeoned over the past 20 
      years and interventions aiming to cultivate compassion towards self and others 
      have been developed. This meta-analysis examined the effects of compassion-based 
      interventions on a range of outcome measures. METHOD: Twenty-one randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) from the last 12 years were included in the 
      meta-analysis, with data from 1,285 participants analyzed. Effect sizes were 
      standardized mean differences calculated using the difference in pre-post change 
      in the treatment group and control group means, divided by the pooled 
      pre-intervention standard deviation. RESULTS: Significant between-group 
      differences in change scores were found on self-report measures of compassion (d 
      = 0.55, k = 4, 95% CI [0.33-0.78]), self-compassion (d = 0.70, k = 13, 95% CI 
      [0.59-0.87]), mindfulness (d = 0.54, k = 6, 95% CI [0.38-0.71]), depression (d = 
      0.64, k = 9, 95% CI [0.45-0.82]), anxiety (d = 0.49, k = 9, 95% CI [0.30-0.68]), 
      psychological distress (d = 0.47, k = 14, 95% CI [0.19-0.56]), and well-being (d 
      = 0.51, k = 8, 95% CI [0.30-0.63]). These results remained when including active 
      control comparisons. Evaluations of risk of bias across studies pointed towards a 
      relative lack of publication bias and robustness of findings. However, the 
      evidence base underpinning compassion interventions relies predominantly on small 
      sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Future directions are provided for compassion 
      research, including the need for improved methodological rigor, larger scale 
      RCTs, increased specificity on the targets of compassion, and examination of 
      compassion across the lifespan. Although further research is warranted, the 
      current state of evidence highlights the potential benefits of compassion-based 
      interventions on a range of outcomes.

TI  - Effects of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Doctors' Mindfulness, Empathy, and 
      Communication Skills.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18084033 [doi]
LID - 4033
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of increasing doctor-patient tensions in China, the 
      objective of this study was to explore and examine the effects of loving-kindness 
      meditation (LKM) on doctors' mindfulness, empathy, and communication skills. 
      METHODS: A total of 106 doctors were recruited from a hospital in China, and 
      randomly divided into an LKM training group (n = 53) and waiting control group (n 
      = 53). The LKM training group received 8 weeks of LKM training intervention, 
      whereas the control group received no intervention. Three major variables 
      (mindfulness, empathy, and communication skills) were measured before (pre-test) 
      and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. RESULTS: The empathy and 
      communication skills of the LKM group were significantly improved compared with 
      those of the control group, but the level of mindfulness did not significantly 
      change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that LKM may contribute to improving 
      physicians' empathy and communication skills. However, the mechanisms that 
      underlie the effects of the LKM on mindfulness, empathy, and communication skills 
      and other psychological constructs needs further elucidation.

AB  - The majority of women veterans experience chronic pain and many have comorbid 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To enhance resilience in these veterans in 
      terms of both physical functioning and psychosocial well-being, a 
      mindfulness-based, trauma-informed, eight-session group pilot program was 
      designed to target emotion regulation and social belonging. Women who engaged in 
      treatment were asked to complete questionnaires assessing pain, functioning, and 
      affective and social well-being before and after the program. The present 
      retrospective research study evaluated (a) whether women who engaged in treatment 
      showed pre-to-post treatment improvement in psychosocial and physical functioning 
      and (b) whether women referred to the program who engaged versus did not engage 
      in treatment differed in demographic and clinical data (i.e., pain diagnoses, 
      mental health diagnoses, documented trauma history) obtained from medical record 
      review. The sample consisted of 36 women who began the program and filled out a 
      pregroup questionnaire (intent-to-treat sample; ITT) and 105 women who were 
      referred but did not engage in treatment. The majority had a documented history 
      of trauma, a mood disorder, and a PTSD diagnosis. ITT analyses indicated that 
      veterans showed moderate-to-large pre-post improvements in pain severity, pain 
      catastrophizing, physical functioning, depression, self-compassion, and positive 
      affect. Veterans who engaged in treatment were similar to those who did not in 
      demographics, number of pain diagnoses, and mental health diagnoses, but were 
      more likely to have a documented history of trauma. Despite the limitations of 
      this study, the findings are encouraging and point to the value of a future 
      randomized controlled trial. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

AB  - OBJECTIVES: the psychological state of parents, who are considered the primary 
      caregivers of a sick child, can affect the child's behavior and emotions. This 
      study analyzed the effectiveness of self-compassion training on hopelessness and 
      resilience in the parents of children with cancer. METHODS: this was an 
      experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design and a control group. The 
      statistical population included all parents of children with cancer hospitalized 
      in Amir Kabir Hospital of Arak in 2020. The research sample consisted of 30 
      parents of children with cancer selected through convenience sampling. The 
      participants were equally divided into experimental (n = 15) and control (n = 15) 
      groups at random. The research instruments were the Connor-Davidson Resilience 
      Scale (CD-RISC) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The experimental group 
      underwent eight 90 min sessions of self-compassion training on a weekly basis. 
      Finally, the multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was employed for data 
      analysis. RESULTS: the mean (±SD) of the post-test scores of hopelessness and 
      resilience were reported 10.20 (±4.95) and 43.33 (±4.27), respectively, in the 
      experimental group, whereas they were reported 13.78 (±4.94) and 38.73 (±4.07), 
      respectively, in the control group. According to the results, self-compassion 
      training had significant effects on the resilience and hopelessness of the 
      parents of children with cancer (p < 0.01). Self-compassion training had a 
      positive, significant effect on their resilience. It was also efficient in 
      decreasing their hopelessness. CONCLUSIONS: self-compassion training improved 
      resilience and mitigated hopelessness in the parents of children with cancer.

LID - 10.1136/bmjment-2023-300955 [doi]
LID - e300955
AB  - QUESTION: Mindfulness-based programmes (MBPs) and practices have demonstrated 
      effects in mental health and well-being, yet questions regarding the target 
      mechanisms that drive change across the population remain unresolved. STUDY 
      SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: Five databases were searched for randomised controlled 
      trials that evaluate the indirect effects (IEs) of an MBP or mindfulness practice 
      in relation to mental health and well-being outcomes through psychological 
      mechanisms. FINDINGS: 27 eligible studies were identified, with only four 
      exploring mechanisms in the context of specific mindfulness practices. 
      Significant IEs were reported for mindfulness skills, decentering and attitudes 
      of mindfulness (eg, self-compassion) across different outcomes, population 
      samples, mental health strategies and active comparators. Evidence gap maps and 
      requirements for testing and reporting IEs are provided to help guide future 
      work. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness skills, decentering and attitudes of mindfulness 
      may be key intervention targets for addressing the mental health of whole 
      populations. However, future work needs to address significant knowledge gaps 
      regarding the evidence for alternative mechanisms (eg, attention and awareness) 
      in relation to unique outcomes (eg, well-being), mental health strategies (ie, 
      promotion) and active comparators. High-quality trials, with powered multivariate 
      mediation analyses that meet key requirements, will be needed to advance this 
      area of work. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/NY2AH.

AB  - Higher education's expectations place demands on students' attainment, leading 
      them to experience stress and anxiety, which negatively affect their academic 
      improvement and life satisfaction. The aim of this systematic review was to 
      investigate (a) if mindfulness as an inner ability is related to academic 
      attainment, through dependent variables, including compassion, engagement, stress 
      or anxiety state, depression, self-efficacy, mindfulness's facets 
      (non-reactivity, acting with awareness) and (b) if mindfulness-based 
      interventions positively affect the academic performance of college and 
      university students. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the 
      PRISMA statement. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library Wiley were 
      screened to identify studies published relevant to the topic. In total, 568 
      papers were retrieved in the initial search. Five papers met the eligibility 
      criteria and were included in the systematic review: a randomized controlled 
      trial, a non-randomized controlled trial, a quasi-experimental study, a 
      quantitative exploratory pilot study, and a longitudinal randomized controlled 
      study. Most interventional studies revealed a non-significant direct effect of 
      practicing mindfulness technique on academic attainment. Further research, 
      especially randomized controlled trials are necessary to clarify the effect of 
      mindfulness on academic performance of college and university students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of the loving-kindness meditation 
      (LKM) on employees' mindfulness, affect, altruism and knowledge hiding. METHODS: 
      In total, 100 employees were recruited from a knowledge-based enterprise in China 
      and randomly divided into the LKM training group (n = 50) and the control group 
      (n = 50). The LKM training group underwent LKM training for 8 weeks, while the 
      control group did not. Seven main variables (mindfulness, altruism positive 
      affect, negative affect, playing dumb, rationalized hiding, and evasive hiding) 
      were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training 
      intervention. RESULTS: The LKM intervention significantly increased participants' 
      altruism, and significantly reduced negative affect, playing dumb and evasive 
      hiding, but did not significantly improve mindfulness, positive affect, and 
      rationalized hiding. CONCLUSIONS: LKM significantly improved employees' altruism, 
      and significantly reduce their negative affect, but did not significantly improve 
      their mindfulness and positive affect. For knowledge hiding, LKM significantly 
      reduced playing dumb and evasive hiding, but had no significant effect on 
      rationalized hiding. These results further elucidate the psychological effects of 
      LKM and suggest the possibility of reducing knowledge hiding in the workplace.

TI  - Efficacy of yoga for caregivers of persons with dementia: An integrative review.
PG  - 980-990
LID - 10.1111/scs.13172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The progressive nature of dementia leaves the person vulnerable and 
      dependent on others for care. While persons with dementia often have better 
      outcomes when cared for at home, it can lead to personal challenges and 
      self-neglect of the caregiver. Mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga can 
      lessen the potential negative effects encountered by caregivers of persons with 
      dementia. AIM: The aim of this review was to synthesise available empirical 
      research related to the role of yoga on the biopsychosocial health outcomes for 
      caregivers of persons with dementia population. METHOD: A systematic search of 
      the databases Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus, Medline and PsychINFO was 
      done using the terms "yoga" AND "caregivers or family members or informal 
      caregivers" AND "dementia or Alzheimer's." Using the selection process outlined 
      by the PRISMA framework, thirty-six studies met the initial criteria and were 
      potentially relevant to the topic. A methodological check was performed using the 
      critical appraisal tool of Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt and the GRADE system of 
      recommendation. This process led to the inclusion of four articles. FINDINGS: 
      Four studies were included for this review: two randomised controlled trials, a 
      non-randomised intervention study with a waitlist and a pilot cohort study. Three 
      studies focused on informal caregivers and one study involved professional 
      caregivers. In all studies, yoga practices included asanas, pranayama, relaxation 
      and meditation. This integrative review recommended that yoga may be useful in 
      reducing stress, depression and anxiety while increasing quality of life 
      indicators, vitality indicators, self-compassion scores, mindfulness attention, 
      sleep quality and diastolic blood pressure. Outcomes that were not significantly 
      changed were caregiver burden, systolic blood pressure and heart rate. However, 
      the level of evidence was moderate with small sample sizes suggesting additional 
      research is needed to include well-designed randomised controlled trials with 
      larger sample sizes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy distress among childbearing women is common and can 
      negatively affect both mother and infant. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) 
      may have a positive effect on pregnancy distress but randomized controlled trials 
      with sufficient power are lacking. The current study examined the effectiveness 
      of an online self-guided MBI in pregnant women with pregnancy distress. METHODS: 
      Pregnant women with elevated pregnancy distress levels at 12 weeks of pregnancy, 
      measured with the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and Tilburg Pregnancy Distress 
      Scale negative affect (TPDS-NA), were randomized into an intervention group 
      (online MBI, N = 109) or control group (care as usual, N = 110). The primary 
      outcome was the change in pregnancy distress post-intervention and at 
      eight-weeks-follow-up. Secondary outcomes were mindfulness skills (Three Facet 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form), rumination (Rumination-Reflection 
      Questionnaire), and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form) at 
      post-intervention and follow-up in the intervention group. RESULTS: Significant 
      improvements were found in pregnancy distress scores, but no significant 
      differences between intervention and control group appeared. The MBI group showed 
      improvements in mindfulness skills, rumination, and self-compassion. LIMITATIONS: 
      Low adherence to the intervention and assessment of secondary outcome measures in 
      the intervention group only. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention trial with one of the 
      largest samples (N = 219) provided no evidence of a significant effect of an 
      online self-guided MBI in distressed pregnant women. An online MBI may be 
      associated with an improvement in mindfulness skills, rumination, and 
      self-compassion. Future research should address the effectiveness of MBI's with 
      different formats (online and group-based combined) and examine a possible 
      delayed effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03917745, registered

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of web-based compassion interventions on 
      the mental well-being of family caregivers. DESIGN: Systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trials of 
      web-based compassion intervention for family caregivers. METHODS: MEDLINE, 
      Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Proquest were searched 
      from database inception until manuscript submission date. Eligible studies 
      included family caregivers participating in web-based compassionate interventions 
      with reported mental wellness indicators, such as self-compassion. Two 
      independent researchers conducted a literature review, extracted data, and 
      assessed the quality of each study using the risk of bias 2 tool. Random effects 
      meta-analysis was performed to pool the data, followed by subgroup analyses, 
      sensitivity analyses, and Egger's tests. RESULTS: Of 1095 studies evaluated, 8 
      randomized controlled trials (encompassing 1978 participants) were included, with 
      75% exhibiting low risk of bias and high-quality evidence. Meta-analysis results 
      indicated positive effects of web-based compassion interventions on family 
      caregivers' self-compassion [standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.33; 95% CI, 
      0.08-0.58; P = .009] and mindfulness (SMD, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.03-0.90; P = .04). 
      These interventions also demonstrated a positive impact on reducing stress 
      (SMD, -0.32; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.04; P = .02) and anxiety (SMD, -0.28; 95% 
      CI, -0.47 to -0.09; P = .003). Subgroup analyses highlighted superior 
      self-compassion outcomes for caregivers supporting individuals with mental 
      illness and cancer compared with those caring for individuals with Alzheimer's 
      disease. Interventions lasting ≥8 weeks were the most common and effective. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Web-based compassion interventions benefit family 
      caregivers by enhancing self-compassion, mindfulness, and reducing anxiety and 
      stress. More well-designed studies are suggested for future clinical 
      applications.

AB  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is frequently used to attenuate the severity 
      of positive schizophrenia symptoms; however, few studies have focused on 
      attenuating negative symptoms. Recently, researchers have become interested in 
      the effects of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on schizophrenia, but the 
      lack of evidence-based results from random clinical trials (RCTs) has limited 
      their effectiveness. Moreover, longitudinal data must be examined using 
      appropriate study designs. We recruited 60 schizophrenia patients and randomly 
      assigned them to an MBI or to a treatment-as-usual group. Negative symptoms, 
      positive symptoms, mindfulness, and depression were assessed at baseline, 
      post-course, and at a 3-month follow-up. Descriptive analysis and generalized 
      estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine the effects of MBI. We found 
      that MBI mitigated the severity of negative symptoms and of general schizophrenic 
      psychopathology except for the positive symptoms and for those of depression. 
      Unexpectedly, we did not find long-term effect of mindfulness on negative

TI  - Effects of a brief self-compassion intervention for college students with 
      impostor phenomenon.

LID - 10.1037/cou0000703 [doi]
AB  - The present study used a latent growth curve modeling approach to (a) examine the 
      effectiveness of a brief self-compassion intervention on reducing impostor 
      phenomenon, maladaptive perfectionism, and psychological distress and (b) explore 
      who would benefit more from this intervention. A total of 227 college students at 
      a large Midwest university were randomly assigned to participate in either a 
      4-week brief self-compassion intervention group or a nonintervention control 
      group. Analyses of the effectiveness of the intervention suggested the brief 
      self-compassion intervention had significant treatment effects for reducing 
      impostor phenomenon and maladaptive perfectionism. Moreover, this study also 
      examined whether participants with different levels of fear of self-compassion 
      and core self-evaluation would report different levels of treatment 
      effectiveness. Fear of self-compassion was found to be a significant moderator of 
      the intervention effects in reducing maladaptive perfectionism and psychological 
      distress. Specifically, participants in the intervention group with higher levels 
      of fear of self-compassion reported a greater decline in both maladaptive 
      perfectionism and psychological distress over time when compared to those with 
      lower levels of fear of self-compassion. Core self-evaluation significantly 
      moderated the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing participants' levels 
      of impostor phenomenon and maladaptive perfectionism. Specifically, participants 
      in the intervention group with lower core self-evaluation reported a greater 
      reduction in maladaptive perfectionism over time when compared to those with 
      higher core self-evaluation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights

TI  - Effect of kindness-based meditation on health and well-being: a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1101-14
LID - 10.1037/a0037249 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Kindness-based meditation (KBM) is a rubric covering meditation 
      techniques developed to elicit kindness in a conscious way. Some techniques, for 
      example, loving-kindness meditation and compassion meditation, have been included 
      in programs aimed at improving health and well-being. Our aim was to 
      systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence available from randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of KBM on health and well-being 
      against passive and active control groups in patients and the general population. 
      METHOD: Searches were completed in March 2013. Two reviewers applied 
      predetermined eligibility criteria (RCTs, peer-reviewed publications, theses or 
      conference proceedings, adult participants, KBM interventions) and extracted the 
      data. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were 
      included. KBM was moderately effective in decreasing self-reported depression 
      (standard mean difference [Hedges's g] = -0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      [-1.08, -0.14]) and increasing mindfulness (Hedges's g = 0.63, 95% CI [0.22, 
      1.05]), compassion (Hedges's g = 0.61, 95% CI [0.24, 0.99]) and self-compassion 
      (Hedges's g = 0.45, 95% CI [0.15, 0.75]) against passive controls. Positive 
      emotions were increased (Hedges's g = 0.42, 95% CI [0.10, 0.75]) against 
      progressive relaxation. Exposure to KBM may initially be challenging for some 
      people. RESULTS were inconclusive for some outcomes, in particular against active 
      controls. The methodological quality of the reports was low to moderate. RESULTS 
      suffered from imprecision due to wide CIs deriving from small studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: KBM showed evidence of benefits for the health of individuals and 
      communities through its effects on well-being and social interaction. Further 
      research including well-conducted large RCTs is warranted.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion program for chronic pain patients: A randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 930-944
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1734 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although evidence-based psychological treatments for chronic pain 
      (CP) have been demonstrated to be effective for a variety of outcomes, modest 
      effects observed in recent reviews indicate scope for improvement. 
      Self-compassion promotes a proactive attitude towards self-care and actively 
      seeking relief from suffering. Consequently, more compassionate people experience 
      better physical, psychological and interpersonal well-being. METHODS: We 
      conducted a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial to examine the effects of 
      a Mindful Self-Compassion program (MSC) on relevant clinical outcomes in patients 
      with CP. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention arms: MSC 
      or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). The protocols of both intervention arms 
      were standardized and consisted of a 150-min session once a week during 8 weeks 
      formatted to groups of no more than 20 participants. The primary outcome was 
      self-compassion, measured with the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). The secondary 
      outcomes were other pain-related scores, quality-of-life measures, and anxiety 
      and depression scores. RESULTS: In all, 62 and 61 patients were assigned to the 
      MSC and CBT groups, respectively. The MSC intervention was more effective than 
      CBT for self-compassion (average treatment effect [ATE] = 0.126, p < 0.05). The 
      secondary outcomes, pain acceptance (ATE = 5.214, p < 0.01), pain interference 
      (ATE = -0.393, p < 0.05), catastrophizing (ATE = -2.139, p < 0.10) and anxiety 
      (ATE = -0.902, p < 0.05), were also favoured in the experimental arm (MSC). No 
      serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful Self-Compassion is an 
      appropriate therapeutic approach for CP patients and may result in greater 
      benefits on self-compassion and emotional well-being than CBT. SIGNIFICANCE: This 
      randomized controlled trial compares the novel intervention (MSC program) with 
      the gold standard psychological intervention for CP (CBT). MSC improves the 
      levels of self-compassion, a therapeutic target that is receiving attention since 
      the last two decades, and it also improves anxiety symptoms, pain interference 
      and pain acceptance more than what CBT does. These results provide empirical 
      support to guide clinical work towards the promotion of self-compassion in 
      psychotherapeutic interventions for people with CP.

TI  - Mindfulness Intervention Improves Coping and Perceptions of Children's Behavior 
      among Families with Elevated Risk.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20237092 [doi]
LID - 7092
AB  - Mindfulness-informed interventions (MIIs) are increasingly common but have not 
      been extensively studied among families with elevated levels of risk (e.g., those 
      involved in child protective services and/or receiving financial assistance). 
      These families often experience high rates of stressors that can impact coping 
      strategies, interpersonal dynamics, and relationships. Given that mindfulness has 
      been shown to promote health and wellbeing, this study used a sample from two 
      pilot randomized controlled trials to test the extent to which a 
      mindfulness-informed intervention improved coping strategies and perceptions of 
      children's behavior among 53 families with elevated risk. A principal components 
      analysis with a direct oblimin rotation revealed that cognitive-emotion coping 
      strategies could be characterized by three factors: positive adaptation, negative 
      adaptation, and positive refocusing. Intention-to-treat analysis indicated 
      significant group by time differences, with intervention participants 
      demonstrating improvements in positive refocusing coping, positive adaptation 
      coping, and perceptions of children's behavior problems compared to participants 
      in the waitlist control group. No significant differences were found for negative 
      adaptation coping strategies. Findings provide preliminary support for the 
      benefits of mindfulness training in a sample generally underrepresented in the 
      mindfulness intervention literature.

TI  - Cultivating concern for others: Meditation training and motivated engagement with 
      human suffering.
PG  - 2897-2924
LID - 10.1037/xge0001431 [doi]
AB  - Contemplative traditions have long affirmed that compassion and kindness are 
      trainable skills. While research on meditation practice has recently flourished, 
      the mechanisms that might engender such changes are still poorly understood. 
      Here, we present a motivational framework to explain why meditation training 
      should increase concern for others and modulate empathic engagement with human 
      suffering over time. Meditation practices are conceived as tools for enacting 
      cognitive and emotion regulatory goals that are conditioned by the underlying 
      ethical motivation of the training-to reduce and alleviate suffering. In support 
      of this account, we present data from a randomized, wait-list-controlled study of 
      intensive meditation. In Study 1, we use a novel cardiovascular index to show 
      that 3 months of meditation training can increase the motivational salience of 
      others' suffering, as compared to the salience of threats to oneself. In Study 2, 
      we demonstrate that training-related changes in the ability to orient attention 
      to suffering are mediated by the dynamic regulation of distress-related 
      physiological arousal. Finally, in Study 3, we provide exploratory evidence 
      suggesting that meditation training may influence how human suffering is encoded 
      in memory, leaving lasting imprints on the recollection of emotional experience. 
      Together, our findings suggest that meditation training can strengthen the 
      motivational relevance of others' suffering, prompting a shift from self-focused 
      to other-focused evaluative processing. Considering meditation training from a 
      motivational standpoint offers an important perspective for understanding how 
      compassion can be cultivated through intentional practice. (PsycInfo Database

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Residents: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 429-436
LID - 10.1007/s11606-017-4249-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burnout is highly prevalent in residents. No randomized controlled 
      trials have been conducted measuring the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress 
      Reduction (MBSR) on burnout in residents. OBJECTIVE: To determine the 
      effectiveness of MBSR in reducing burnout in residents. DESIGN: A randomized 
      controlled trial comparing MBSR with a waitlist control group. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Residents from all medical, surgical and primary care disciplines were eligible 
      to participate. Participants were self-referred. INTERVENTION: The MBSR consisted 
      of eight weekly 2.5-h sessions and one 6-h silent day. MAIN MEASURES: The primary 
      outcome was the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Dutch version of the Maslach 
      Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey. Secondary outcomes included the 
      depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment subscales of burnout, 
      worry, work-home interference, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, positive 
      mental health, empathy and medical errors. Assessment took place at baseline and 
      post-intervention approximately 3 months later. KEY RESULTS: Of the 148 residents 
      participating, 138 (93%) completed the post-intervention assessment. No 
      significant difference in emotional exhaustion was found between the two groups. 
      However, the MBSR group reported significantly greater improvements than the 
      control group in personal accomplishment (p = 0.028, d = 0.24), worry (p = 0.036, 
      d = 0.23), mindfulness skills (p = 0.010, d = 0.33), self-compassion (p = 0.010, 
      d = 0.35) and perspective-taking (empathy) (p = 0.025, d = 0.33). No effects were 
      found for the other measures. Exploratory moderation analysis showed that the 
      intervention outcome was moderated by baseline severity of emotional exhaustion; 
      those with greater emotional exhaustion did seem to benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results of our primary outcome analysis did not support the effectiveness of MBSR 
      for reducing emotional exhaustion in residents. However, residents with high 
      baseline levels of emotional exhaustion did appear to benefit from MBSR. 
      Furthermore, they demonstrated modest improvements in personal accomplishment, 
      worry, mindfulness skills, self-compassion and perspective-taking. More research 
      is needed to confirm these results.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) delivered via the Internet 
      become increasingly popular for improving maternal mental health, but the 
      effectiveness of internet-delivered MBIs (iMBIs) is still unclear. METHODS: 
      PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials were searched. We included studies that were randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental study design, and pre-post test 
      design and contained information on the population of interest (women during 
      pregnancy or within one year after delivery), intervention contents (mindfulness 
      components), and intervention delivery formats (internet-based). ROBINS-I and RoB 
      2 were used to rate the risk of bias in non-RCTs and RCTs, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Eleven studies composed of six RCTs and five non-RCTs were included. The overall 
      risk of bias was high. IMBIs are effective in improving maternal depression and 
      mindfulness and self-compassion. However, limited by the small number of studies 
      included in the review, effect sizes of iMBIs cannot be estimated. 
      Characteristics of iMBIs (delivery formats, duration, et al.) and studies (study 
      design, measures et al.) were described. CONCLUSION: iMBIs are still in the 
      initial stage. Studies with rigorous study design and larger sample size, and 
      determining the optimal delivery formats and duration and intensity of 
      interventions are necessary.

TI  - Mindfulness-based therapy for smoking cessation and mental health: a randomised 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 336-343
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Effective smoking cessation programmes are essential for assisting 
      smokers in quitting, indirectly lowering mortality and morbidity associated with 
      smoking. Numerous studies have indicated positive outcomes when using mindfulness 
      treatment (MT) to treat psychological or behavioural health issues. Although to 
      date, no study has looked at the effectiveness of online MT for quitting smoking 
      while addressing mental health, particularly among the Asian population. 
      Therefore, this study compares the efficiency of online MT to traditional 
      counselling therapy (CT) in aiding smoking cessation programmes while also 
      addressing mental health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomised control study with 
      a two-group, single-blind design and baseline evaluation was selected. Social 
      media sites were used to advertise for participants, who were then admitted after 
      meeting the requirements. Participants who met the eligibility requirements were 
      randomly split into two groups. Each group received a total of three sessions of 
      online therapy (MT or CT), once every two weeks, as well as one phone call per 
      week as reinforcement. At the beginning and end of the intervention, participants 
      completed questionnaires (1st week and 5th week). Generalized Estimating Equation 
      (GEE) statistical analysis was used to analyse all the variables. RESULTS: The MT 
      group experienced a statistically significant decrease in cigarette consumption 
      (β: -3.50, 95% Wald CI: - 4.62, -2.39) compared to the CT group over time. 
      Furthermore, the MT group demonstrated significant improvements in their scores 
      for the AAQ-2, anxiety, stress, depression and mindfulness compared to the CT 
      group. CONCLUSION: Online MT is more successful at assisting smokers in lowering 
      their daily cigarette intake and supporting their mental health during the 
      smoking cessation process. Further longitudinal comparisons of the effectiveness 
      of online MT should be undertaken using online platforms in future studies.

TI  - Effects of Web-Based Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Anxiety, Depression, and 
      Stress Among Frontline Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e44000

LID - e44000
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has spread around the world, and 
      health care workers, as frontline workers, have faced tremendous psychological 
      stress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore whether web-based 
      mindfulness-based interventions continue to have a positive impact on anxiety, 
      depression, and stress among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      METHODS: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) participants were frontline 
      health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the experimental group was 
      a web-based mindfulness-based intervention; (3) the control group used either 
      general psychological intervention or no intervention; (4) outcome indicators 
      included scales to assess anxiety, depression, and stress; and (5) the study type 
      was a randomized controlled study. Studies that did not meet the above 
      requirements were excluded. We searched 9 databases, including Web of Science, 
      Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SinoMed, China National 
      Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, for randomized controlled 
      studies on the effects of web-based mindfulness-based interventions on common 
      mental disorder symptoms among health care workers from January 1, 2020, to 
      October 20, 2022. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed 
      using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The Cochrane risk of bias tool 
      was used to assess the risk of bias. Subgroup analysis was used to look for 
      sources of heterogeneity and to explore whether the results were the same for 
      subgroups under different conditions. Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the 
      stability of the pooled results. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomized controlled 
      studies with 1311 participants were included. The results showed that web-based 
      mindfulness-based interventions were effective in reducing the symptoms of 
      anxiety (standard mean difference [SMD]=-0.63, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.31, P<.001, 
      I(2)=87%), depression (SMD=-0.52, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.26, P<.001, I(2)=75%), and 
      stress (SMD=-0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05, P=.01, I(2)=58%) among health care 
      workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with wide CIs and high heterogeneity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in 
      reducing the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress among frontline health 
      care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this effect is relatively 
      mild and needs to be further explored by better studies in the future. TRIAL

      in a non-judgmental manner. Extensive mindfulness-based interventions have been 
      shown to have positive effects in patients with psoriasis. However, it is unclear 
      whether brief (2-week) interventions are also beneficial. Therefore, the aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of a 2-week mindfulness-based 
      intervention in patients with psoriasis. Patients were randomly assigned to an 
      experimental (treatment-as-usual + mindfulness-based intervention) or control 
      group (treatment-as-usual) during their clinic stay. All variables were measured 
      by self-report using validated questionnaires: primary outcomes were mindfulness 
      and self-compassion, secondary outcomes were itch catastrophizing, social 
      anxiety, stress and skin status. Variables were assessed prior to, immediately 
      and 3 months after the intervention. Effects were tested by repeated-measures 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses of pre-post-measurements (n = 39) revealed 
      a significant interaction effect on self-reported mindfulness [F(1,35) = 7.46, 
      p = 0.010, η2p = 0.18] and a tendency to a significant effect on self-reported 
      self-compassion [F(1,36) = 3.03, p = 0.090, η2p = 0.08]. There were no other 
      significant effects, but most descriptive data were in favour of the experimental 
      group. However, the control group showed a greater improvement in skin status. 
      Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and investigate which 
      subgroups especially profit from such an intervention.

TI  - Prenatal stress self-help mindfulness intervention via social media: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 206-215
LID - 10.1080/09638237.2021.1952947 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal stress is a pressing issue. However, there is a lack of 
      robust evidence for psychosocial interventions to manage this problem. AIMS: This 
      study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention on 
      reducing prenatal stress compared to participation in health education groups. 
      METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a prenatal clinic of 
      comprehensive tertiary care from April to October 2017. A total of 108 pregnant 
      women were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Participants 
      completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, fatigue, 
      positive and negative affect, and mindfulness before, immediately after, and 
      15 weeks after the 4-week intervention period. Generalized estimating equations 
      were used to analyze the intervention outcomes. RESULTS: The results supported 
      greater improvement in terms of perceived stress (Wald χ(2)=26.94, p<0.001), 
      fatigue (Wald χ(2)=17.61, p<0.001), positive affect (Wald χ(2)=9.03, p = 0.011), 
      negative affect (Wald χ(2)=11.37, p = 0.003), and mindfulness (Wald χ(2)=24.97, 
      p<0.001) in the intervention group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      self-help mindfulness intervention decreased prenatal stress and negative affect 
      and improved positive affect and mindfulness.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Survivors of Lung Cancer and Their Partners: 
      A Systematic Review.
PG  - 616-627
LID - 10.1007/s12529-022-10132-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of lung cancer and their partners often have complex 
      unresolved physical, psychosocial, and behavioral needs that can negatively 
      affect the survivors' and partners' well-being. This systematic review aimed to 
      (1) examine the content and delivery of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) 
      and (2) summarize and synthesize the current evidence for effectiveness of MBIs 
      targeting survivors of lung cancer and/or one selected partner (dyads). METHOD: 
      Six databases were searched for interventional studies published in English 
      between 1980 and June 2020 using three terms (lung neoplasms, mindfulness, 
      caregivers). For outcome measures, the interventions focused on behavioral change 
      (meditation, yoga, stretching, breathing), symptom management (dyspnea, fatigue, 
      sleep disruption, anxiety, depression, stress reduction), and knowledge. Two 
      reviewers independently assessed article eligibility. One reviewer performed and 
      another independently verified data extraction. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 
      for randomized trials was used to critically appraise RCTs. RESULTS: Searching 
      yielded 307 records, of which 64 were assessed for eligibility. Six studies 
      investigated the impact of an MBI on survivors and partners. Four studies were 
      single-arm feasibility studies; two were RCTs. Two feasibility studies and one 
      RCT recruited romantic couples whereas the others recruited asymmetrical dyads. 
      The single-arm studies reported strong feasibility and acceptability. RCTs 
      reported significant outcomes for reduced cancer-related distress and depression, 
      and improved QOL, self-compassion, mindfulness skills, and rumination. 
      CONCLUSION: Dyadic intervention research is a growing field. Few interventions 
      target individuals with lung cancer and their partners. No interventions target 
      partners alone. Future research should evaluate rigorous methodologies that 
      enhance the understanding of independent and interdependent health-related 
      effects within dyads and across relationships and settings.

TI  - Self-compassion training for individuals with social anxiety disorder: a 
      preliminary randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 18-37

AB  - Self-compassion is the ability to offer oneself kindness and compassion in 
      response to failure, suffering, or insecurity. Learning how to be 
      self-compassionate through self-compassion training appears effective for 
      improving psychological well-being in community samples and promising for 
      clinical populations. The current randomized controlled trial was designed to (a) 
      examine the effectiveness of a self-guided self-compassion training program; and 
      (b) determine whether self-compassion training can help mitigate social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD) symptoms. Adults with SAD (n = 63; Mage = 34.3, SD = 11.4; 67.8% 
      female; 84.7% Caucasian) were randomized to a waitlist control condition, a 
      self-guided self-compassion training condition, or a self-guided applied 
      relaxation training condition for six weeks. Outcome measures of SAD symptoms and 
      self-compassion were completed pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, as well as at 
      3-months follow-up. Multilevel linear modelling results suggested the 
      self-compassion training program was statistically superior at improving outcome 
      measures relative to the waitlist control condition (ps < .05; 
      η(2)(p)s = .12-.33), but not relative to the applied relaxation training 
      condition (ps > .05; η(2)(p)s = .01-.05). Self-compassion training produced 
      greater clinically significant gains in self-compassion and reductions in fear of 
      self-compassion compared to both the waitlist condition and applied relaxation 
      training. The current trial provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness 
      of a self-help self-compassion training program and provides evidence that 
      self-compassion training may be beneficial for managing clinically significant 
      SAD symptoms.

LID - 10.1002/imhj.21831 [doi]
AB  - This study tests a group-based secular contemplative practice intervention, 
      Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT), with parents of young children. We 
      report on a randomized controlled preliminary efficacy study. Certified teachers 
      administered CBCT for 20 hr across 8 to 10 weeks in two cohorts of parents with 
      infants and young children. The intervention group was compared to a waitlist 
      control group. Thirty-nine parents and their children, who ranged in age from 4 
      months to 5 years, were evaluated at pre- and postintervention (n = 25 
      intervention, n = 14 waitlist control) on hair cortisol concentration. Parents 
      also completed self-administered questionnaires at both time points regarding 
      demographics, physical symptoms of stress, parenting stress, self-compassion, and 
      mindfulness. Children of parents in the CBCT group experienced significant 
      decreases in cortisol at the postintervention assessment, as compared with the 
      control group. However, parent cortisol and self-report measures did not 
      significantly change other than a small effect on clinical levels of parenting 
      stress. CBCT may be a positive new way to intervene with parents to lower 
      infants' and young children's cumulative physiological stress.

      mixed method study.
PG  - 826

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, more than half of the teachers working in primary 
      education experience high levels of work stress. Compared to other professions, 
      teachers are more likely to drop out from work and develop mental illnesses. 
      Almost one in five even choose a new profession within 5 years after starting as 
      a teacher. This indicates an urgent need for interventions to reduce stress 
      levels in teachers. However, few evidence-based effective interventions targeting 
      stress and work-related problems in the primary educational system are available. 
      AIM: In the current paper, we describe the protocol for a randomized controlled 
      study (RCT) comparing an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) 
      intervention with a wait list control condition in primary school teachers. We 
      hypothesize that teachers who participate in the MBSR programme will report less 
      stress (primary outcome) than those in the control group at post-test and at 
      3-month follow-up. We also expect a decrease in teachers' absenteeism and 
      improvements of mental health, teacher skills, classroom climate quality and the 
      pupil-teacher relationship (secondary outcomes). Finally, we hypothesize that 
      self-compassion, mindfulness skills and emotion regulation skills could mediate 
      effects. METHODS/DESIGN: A mixed-method study will be conducted among N=155 Dutch 
      primary school teachers (grade 1 to 6). The quantitative study will be an RCT, in 
      which teachers will be randomly allocated to the MBSR or waiting list control 
      condition. Trial participants will not be made actively aware of their condition. 
      The data analysts will be blinded. Online questionnaires will be sent to teachers 
      before and after the MBSR programme, and at 3-month follow-up. Information about 
      absenteeism will be collected. In the qualitative part of the study, we will 
      interview teachers to examine their perceived effects of MBSR on their teaching 
      skills, the classroom climate quality and the pupil-teacher relationship. 
      DISCUSSION: This protocol paper describes a mixed-method study design with an RCT 
      and a qualitative evaluation to evaluate an MBSR programme on perceived stress 
      among primary school teachers. If the MBSR programme proves to be effective, it 
      could be implemented as a programme to reduce stress and improve mental health 
      and teaching outcomes in primary school teachers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederland

AB  - Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) is a common sexual dysfunction in women. 
      Both mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus psychoeducation and sex 
      therapy, education, and support (STEP; which contains the same educational 
      information as in the MBCT arm but also integrates supportive-expressive 
      therapy), are effective. We tested mediators and moderators of improvements. Each 
      treatment arm consisted of eight sessions delivered weekly, and participants 
      completed measures online pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6- 
      and 12-month post-treatment. Depression, self-reported interoceptive awareness, 
      self-compassion, self-criticism, and mindfulness were examined as mediators, and 
      expectations for improvement as a moderator. Of 148 cisgender women who 
      consented, 70 were randomized to the MBCT plus psychoeducation group (mean age 
      39.3 ± 13.2 yrs) and 78 to the STEP group (mean age 37.9 ± 12.2 yrs). Decreases 
      in depression mediated decreases in sexual distress in the MBCT plus 
      psychoeducation group only. Improvements in interoceptive awareness mediated 
      changes in both sexual desire and arousal, and sexual distress, and to a greater 
      degree after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in self-compassion mediated 
      changes in sexual desire and arousal only for the MBCT plus psychoeducation group 
      and mediated changes in sexual distress in both groups. Reductions in 
      self-criticism mediated improvements in sexual distress to a greater extent after 
      MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in mindfulness predicted changes in desire and 
      arousal, and distress only in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group. Expectations 
      for improvement did not moderate any outcomes. The findings have implications for 
      understanding common and potentially distinct pathways by which MBCT plus 
      psychoeducation and supportive sex education improve symptoms of SIAD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine the effects of a mindfulness group 
      intervention on self-compassion, psychological resilience, and mental health of 
      children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas. METHODS: A total of 64 
      children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas were randomly allocated to 
      a control group (n = 32) and an intervention group (n = 32). Participants in the 
      control group received conventional education, while participants in the 
      intervention group received 6-week mindfulness intervention in addition to the 
      conventional education. Both groups completed the Five Facet Mindfulness 
      Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-compassion Scale (SCS), Resilience Scale for Chinese 
      Adolescent (RSCA), and the Mental Health Test (MHT) before and after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, the levels of mindfulness and 
      self-compassion in the intervention group were significantly improved in relative 
      to the control group. The positive cognition in the RSCA was significantly 
      increased in the intervention group, whereas no significant change was observed 
      in the control group. There was a trend towards lower self-blame in the MHT, but 
      no significant impact of the intervention on the overall level of mental health 
      was found. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a 6-week mindfulness training 
      effectively improve self-compassion and resilience of single-parent children. 
      Thus, mindfulness training as a cost-effective approach can be arranged in the 
      curriculum, which helps students develop high level of self-compassion and 
      resilience. In addition, there may be a need to improve emotional control in 
      order to improve mental health.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation Effects on Well-Being and Altruism: A Mixed-Methods 
      Online RCT.
PG  - 322-350
LID - 10.1111/aphw.12074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that facilitating empathy could improve 
      individuals' well-being. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) could be a facilitator, 
      and online delivery a cost-effective format. METHODS: We conducted an 
      internet-based randomised controlled trial recruiting 809 adults to test whether 
      an LKM course improves well-being through evoking pleasant emotions, 
      psychological resources, and altruism compared to a light physical exercise 
      course (LE). Participants in both arms followed video-based instructions, 
      completed post-intervention questionnaires, and used online diaries and forums. 
      To measure altruism £10/$10 were offered to participants with a choice of 
      donating all/half to charity. Thematic analysis was applied to diary/forum 
      entries. RESULTS: Both courses increased well-being without significant 
      differences. LKM participants were less anxious than LE participants (ß = -0.22, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.43, -0.02], p = .03), and more likely to donate 
      £5/$5 (Relative Risk = 3.57, 95%CI [0.82, 15.50], p = .09). Attrition was high 
      (82%). Participants engaged in diary/forum usage. LKM was an emotionally intense 
      experience, generating deep reflections and increased connectedness but difficult 
      for some to process. LE led to gentle increases in relaxation, generating a sense 
      of achievement. CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs to confirm findings and devise 
      ways of delivering online LKM effectively to diverse populations.

LID - e0283169
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The main objective of the study will be to evaluate the effects of 
      two widely used standardized mindfulness-based programs [Mindfulness-Based Stress 
      Reduction (MBSR) and Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT)], on epigenetic, 
      neurobiological, psychological, and physiological variables. METHODS: The 
      programs will be offered in an intensive retreat format in a general population 
      sample of healthy volunteer adults. During a 7-day retreat, participants will 
      receive MBSR and CCT in a crossover design where participants complete both 
      programs in random order. After finishing their first 3-day training with one of 
      the two programs, participants will be assigned to the second 3-day training with 
      the second program. The effects of the MBSR and CCT programs, and their 
      combination, will be measured by epigenetic changes (i.e., DNA methylation 
      biomarkers), neurobiological and psychophysiological measures (i.e., EEG resting 
      state, EKG, respiration patterns, and diurnal cortisol slopes), self-report 
      questionnaires belonging to different psychological domains (i.e., mindfulness, 
      compassion, well-being, distress, and general functioning), and stress tasks 
      (i.e., an Arithmetic Stress Test and the retrieval of negative autobiographical 
      memories). These measures will be collected from both groups on the mornings of 
      day 1 (pre-program), day 4 (after finishing the first program and before 
      beginning the second program), and day 7 (post-second program). We will conduct a 
      3-month and a 12-month follow-up using only the set of self-report measures. 
      DISCUSSION: This study aims to shed light on the neurobiological and 
      psychological mechanisms linked to meditation and compassion in the general 
      population. The protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: 
      NCT05516355; August 23, 2022).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been used effectively to treat a 
      variety of physical and psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, 
      and chronic pain. Recently, several lines of research have explored the potential 
      for mindfulness-therapy in treating somatization disorders, including 
      fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: 
      Thirteen studies were identified as fulfilling the present criteria of employing 
      randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy of any form of MBT in 
      treating somatization disorders. A meta-analysis of the effects of 
      mindfulness-based therapy on pain, symptom severity, quality of life, depression, 
      and anxiety was performed to determine the potential of this form of treatment. 
      FINDINGS: While limited in power, the meta-analysis indicated a small to moderate 
      positive effect of MBT (compared to wait-list or support group controls) in 
      reducing pain (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.37, -0.03; p<0.05), symptom severity (SMD 
      = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.54, -0.26; p<0.001), depression (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.40, 
      -0.07, p<0.01), and anxiety (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.42, 0.02, p = 0.07) 
      associated with somatization disorders, and improving quality of life (SMD = 
      0.39, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.59; p<0.001) in patients with this disorder. Subgroup 
      analyses indicated that the efficacy of MBT was most consistent for irritable 
      bowel syndrome (p<0.001 for pain, symptom severity, and quality of life), and 
      that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (MCBT) were more effective than eclectic/unspecified MBT. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Preliminary evidence suggests that MBT may be effective in treating at least some 
      aspects of somatization disorders. Further research is warranted.

TI  - Effect of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention on Self-Compassionate Behaviors: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2757-2788
LID - 10.1177/00332941221080410 [doi]
AB  - Self-compassion is regarded as a mediating or moderating variable in 
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBI). However, few studies have investigated the 
      role of self-compassion on MBI. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled 
      trial to examine whether (1) MBI decreases depression and trait anxiety, while 
      increasing trait mindfulness, trait self-compassion, self-compassionate behaviors 
      (SC behaviors), mindful behaviors, and mood after behaviors; and (2) SC behaviors 
      moderate the effect of mindful behaviors on mood in daily life. Participants were 
      patients with depression and/or anxiety (N=19) in Japan. Of the 27 participants 
      recruited, 19 participated in the study. Using stratified randomization, we 
      allocated 10 participants to the intervention group, with an 8-week standard MBI, 
      and nine to the waitlist control group. Depression, trait anxiety, trait 
      mindfulness, and trait self-compassion were assessed using questionnaires, while 
      SC behaviors, mindful behaviors, and mood were measured using an ecological 
      momentary assessment-a method used to repeatedly record events and behaviors in 
      daily life. The results revealed that depression, trait anxiety, trait 
      mindfulness, and trait self-compassion did not significantly change. However, SC 
      behaviors, mindful behaviors, and mood significantly improved with MBI. Moreover, 
      the interaction between SC behaviors and mindful behaviors was significantly 
      shown in the pre-intervention, suggesting that SC behaviors moderate the effect 
      of mindful behaviors on mood in daily life.

TI  - Effects of Mindful Practices on Terror of Mortality: A Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - 3043-3057
LID - 10.1007/s12671-022-01967-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Early Buddhist thought clearly recognizes the need for learning how 
      to face one's own mortality, for which purpose mindfulness practice has a central 
      role to play. Fear of death has also been studied in cognitive psychology, 
      leading to what is known as the terror management theory. Actual research 
      evidence in psychology has already shown that mindfulness practice may reduce 
      fear and anxiety in general. However, there is a lack of research examining the 
      specific effects of brief mindfulness practices on the fear of death and dying. 
      In this study we tested the hypothesis that brief mindfulness practices used 
      daily over a period of 6 weeks will result in a reduction of the fear of death 
      and dying when compared to brief contemplative practices used as an active 
      control condition. METHODS: Participants (n = 89) were randomly assigned to the 
      mindfulness (n = 44) and the contemplation (n = 45) conditions and completed 
      validated scales measuring four distinct fears related to either the process of 
      dying or the final event of death (dying of oneself, death of oneself, dying of 
      others, and death of others), mindfulness, and self-compassion at baseline, 
      post-intervention (at 6 weeks) and follow up (1‒3 weeks after the end of the 
      6-week intervention). ANOVA was used to investigate the effects of both 
      interventions on outcome variables over time and between groups. RESULTS: Both 
      mindfulness and contemplative practices were equally effective in reducing fear 
      related to dying of oneself and death of others while increasing fear of dying of 
      others, mindfulness, and self-compassion. No significant intervention effects 
      were found for fear related to death of oneself only. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that fears related to dying of oneself and death of others can be reduced 
      using both mindfulness and contemplative practices that may simultaneously 
      increase mindfulness and self-compassion. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online

TI  - Impact of warm mindfulness on emotion regulation: A randomized controlled 
      effectiveness trial.
PG  - 699-711
LID - 10.1037/hea0001303 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of mindfulness training for primary care 
      (MTPC), an integrated warm mindfulness training program, on emotion regulation 
      and its relationship with health behavior change. Interventions that improve 
      self-regulation, particularly emotion regulation, are needed for the 
      self-management of comorbid chronic physical and mental illnesses. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may impact self-regulation and facilitate 
      health behavior change. METHOD: A randomized controlled comparative effectiveness 
      trial was conducted in a population of adult primary care patients to evaluate 
      the impact of MTPC versus a low-dose mindfulness comparator (LDC) on 
      self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) total score and other 
      assays of self-regulation at baseline, Weeks 8 and 24. Self-reported action plan 
      initiation was reported between Weeks 8 and 10. Participants had diagnoses of 
      anxiety, depression, or stress-related disorders. MTPC is an 8-week 
      insurance-reimbursable warm MBI designed to cultivate mindfulness and 
      self-compassion and to catalyze chronic illness self-management related health 
      behavior change. RESULTS: Compared to LDC, MTPC participants had statistically 
      significant reductions in DERS total score at 8 weeks (d = -0.59, β = -12.98, 95% 
      CI [-23.3 to -2.6]; p = .01) and 24 weeks (d = -0.61, β = -13.35, [-24.3, -2.4]; 
      p = .02). Compared to 38% for LDC, 63% of MTPC participants successfully 
      initiated their action plan within 3 weeks (OR = 2.87, [1.1, 7.9]; p = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial demonstrated MTPC enhanced emotion 
      regulation and facilitated initiation of chronic illness self-management and 
      health behavior change among primary care patients with anxiety, depression, and 
      stress-related disorders, replicating previous reports. (PsycInfo Database Record

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness is an established approach to reduce distress and stress 
      reactivity by improving awareness and tolerability of thoughts and emotions. This 
      study compares mindfulness training to sleep hygiene in persons with multiple 
      sclerosis (PWMS) who report chronic insomnia, examining sleep efficiency (SE), 
      self-reported sleep quality and quality of life. METHODS: Fifty-three PWMS were 
      randomized (1:1) in a single-blinded, parallel group design to ten, two-hour 
      weekly sessions of Mindfulness Based Stress Intervention for Insomnia (MBSI-I) 
      over a span of ten weeks or a single, one hour sleep hygiene (SH) session over 
      one day. The primary outcome measure was SE, measured by the Fitbit™ Charge 2 
      wrist device, at 10 and 16 weeks from the start of study interventions. 
      Self-report outcomes included the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Rating Scale (PSQI), 
      Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 
      Inventory (MSQLI). Nineteen participants in the MBSI-I group and 24 in the SH 
      group completed the primary study. Subsequently, ten participants in the original 
      SH group participated in the 10-week MSBI-I course and their data was added to 
      the MBSI-I cohort (eMSBI-I). RESULTS: While neither SE nor the PSQI showed 
      significant differences between MBSI-I, eMBSI-I and SH groups, ISI improved in 
      both the MSBI-I and eMBSI-I vs SH at 10 weeks (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0275) but not 
      16 weeks. However, pre and post assessments within the MBSI-I and eMBSI-I cohorts 
      did show significant improvement in the PSQI and ISI at 10 and 16 weeks, while SH 
      was significant in the ISI only at 16 weeks. Several quality of life 
      measurements, including fatigue, mental health and cognitive function favored the 
      mindfulness cohorts. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates beneficial effects 
      of MBSR on insomnia, sleep quality and quality of life in PWMS. TRIAL

TI  - Efficacy of mHealth aided 12-week meditation and breath intervention on change in 
      burnout and professional quality of life among health care providers of a 
      tertiary care hospital in north India: a randomized waitlist-controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Burnout is "Chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully 
      managed." Professional quality of life (PQL) includes work related experiences of 
      compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue. Healthcare providers (HCPs) are 
      highly susceptible to burnout and compassion fatigue due to their demanding work, 
      which lowers PQL. Burnout leads to poor care, medical errors, and patient safety 
      across healthcare disciplines. Yoga has been shown to improve resilience, reduce 
      stress, and increase self-compassion and psycho-physiological coherence. This 
      study compared HCPs in a mHealth-aided 12-week yoga-based meditation and breath 
      intervention to waitlist controls for HCP burnout and PQL at a north Indian 
      tertiary care hospital. METHODS: This was randomized waitlist-controlled trial. 
      Total 98 HCPs (62 males and 36 females) with an average age of 
      28.26 ± 3.547 years were enrolled consecutively from March 2021 to November 2022. 
      Randomization was done with opaque sealed envelopes numbered in a 
      computer-generated sequence. The experimental group (n = 49) received 12 online 
      weekly yoga sessions and performed daily home practice (6 days a week). The 
      waitlisted control group (n = 49) continued their daily routine. Maslach's 
      burnout inventory (MBI), professional quality of life (PQL) and anthropometric 
      measurements were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: After 
      12 weeks, the MBI outcomes of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and 
      personal accomplishment showed a highly significant difference between the two 
      groups (p < 0.001). PQL outcomes of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and 
      secondary trauma also differed significantly (p < 0.001). Within group analysis 
      showed that MBI and PQL outcomes improved significantly (p < 0.001) for the 
      experimental group after 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: The current study contributes to 
      the existing evidence on the effectiveness of Yoga in managing stress and 
      developing resilience among doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. 
      Integrating yoga into healthcare settings is crucial for addressing the 
      detrimental impact of burnout on decision-making and promoting positive patient 
      outcomes. mHealth technologies have the potential to enhance the 
      user-friendliness of yoga-based interventions by personalizing the practice space 
      and time. Yoga-based interventions and mHealth technologies can effectively 
      address physician burnout, in a simple and implementable manner.

AB  - This study examined the effect of self-compassion induction on cortisol stress 
      recovery following an acute stressor. A total of 67 male university students 
      completed the Maastricht Acute Stress Test and were then randomized to either a 
      self-compassion (a guided self-compassion writing task) or control condition (a 
      writing task just to review the stress test), followed by a 50-minute resting 
      period. Subjective stress and cortisol levels were assessed at - 15, - 10, 0, 10, 
      20, 30, 40, and 50 min relative to the stress offset. Heart rate and respiratory 
      sinus arrhythmia were monitored throughout the study. Multilevel modeling 
      indicated that self-compassion induction had no significant effect on cortisol 
      recovery. An exploratory analysis examining the moderating effect of trait 
      self-compassion indicated that the effect of self-compassion induction was 
      prominent when trait self-compassion was low but not when it was high. These 
      findings suggest that self-compassion induction may help recovery from stressful 
      experiences, particularly for those who are less self-compassionate.

TI  - The effectiveness of three mobile-based psychological interventions in reducing 
      psychological distress and preventing stress-related changes in the 
      psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune network in breast cancer survivors: Study protocol 
      for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 100628
LID - 10.1016/j.invent.2023.100628 [doi]
LID - 100628
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of literature shows that psychological distress is not 
      only a major threat to psychological well-being but can also have a significant 
      impact on physical health. In cancer patients, it can negatively affect prognosis 
      and posttreatment recovery processes. Since face-to-face psychological 
      interventions are often inaccessible to cancer patients, researchers have 
      recently been focusing on the effectiveness of eHealth adaptations of 
      well-established approaches. In this context, there has been a call for 
      high-quality randomised controlled trials that would allow for a direct 
      comparison of different approaches, potentially addressing different needs and 
      preferences of patients, and also for more systematic research focusing on how 
      psychological interventions affect not only psychological but also biological 
      markers of stress. Both of these questions are addressed in the present study. 
      METHODS: A randomised controlled trial will be carried out to test and compare 
      the effectiveness of three eight-week eHealth programmes for the mental health 
      support of cancer patients. All programmes will be delivered through the same 
      application for mobile devices MOU MindCare. N = 440 of breast cancer survivors 
      will be recruited at the end of their adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, 
      radiotherapy, or both) and randomly assigned to one of the three interventions - 
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Cancer (MBCT-Ca), Positive Psychology 
      (PP), or Autogenic Training (AT) - or the treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. 
      Psychological and biological markers of stress and adaptive functioning will be 
      assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), three-month follow-up (T2), and 
      nine-month follow-up (T3). Primary outcomes will include heart-rate variability 
      and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, general 
      quality of life, and positive mental health. Secondary outcomes will include the 
      levels of serum cortisol and immunomarkers, sleep quality, fatigue, common health 
      symptoms, and several transdiagnostic psychological variables that are expected 
      to be specifically affected by the MBCT-Ca and PP interventions, including 
      dispositional mindfulness, emotion regulation, self-compassion, perceived hope, 
      and gratitude. The data will be analysed using the mixed model repeated measures 
      (MMRM) approach. DISCUSSION: This trial is unique in comparing three different 
      eHealth interventions for cancer patients based on three well-established 
      approaches to mental health support delivered on the same platform. The study 
      will allow us to examine whether different types of interventions affect 
      different indicators of mental health. In addition, it will provide valuable data 
      regarding the effects of stress-reducing psychological interventions on the 
      biomarkers of stress playing an essential role in cancer recovery processes and 
      general health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress and mental disorders in pregnancy can adversely affect the 
      developing fetus. Women with a preconception history of mental disorders or of 
      psychosocial vulnerabilities are at increased risk of experiencing perinatal 
      stress or mental health problems. Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) is an 
      acceptable intervention for pregnant women and has a growing evidence-base with 
      meta-analyses consistently pointing to reductions in symptoms of stress, anxiety 
      and depression. This study protocol aim to address the need for a wider array of 
      evidence-based and non-pharmacological options during pregnancy to reduce stress 
      and improve mental health in a psychosocially highly vulnerable group of women. 
      METHODS: Pregnant women with a preconception history of mental disorders or 
      psychosocial vulnerabilities (n = 240) will be recruited from an obstetric 
      ambulatory clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark. 
      Recruitment for the study began in March 2022 and will continue until the desired 
      number of participants is reached. Consenting pregnant women will be randomized 
      to one of two study arms, an adapted MBSR program as add on to usual care or 
      usual care alone. The primary outcome is mental wellbeing at nine months 
      post-randomization. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include stress, anxiety, 
      depression, and maternal antenatal attachment, experience of childbirth, delivery 
      and mode of delivery. Mindfulness and self-compassion are examined as possible 
      mediators of the effect on outcomes. DISCUSSION: Teaching the skills of 
      mindfulness meditation to a psychosocially vulnerable group of pregnant women 
      could prove a viable and non-pharmacological approach to improve mental health 
      and wellbeing during pregnancy, reduce stress and support the transition to 
      parenthood. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction does not target a particular 
      group, and results from the study is thus of potential relevance for pregnant 
      women in general as a means of reducing stress and improving perinatal mental 
      health and wellbeing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05300646 .

AB  - A randomized-controlled-trial study (N = 219) tested two pre-registered 
      hypotheses that mobile-phone app-based mindfulness training improves wellbeing 
      and increases self-transcendent emotions: gratitude, self-compassion, and awe. 
      Latent change score modeling with a robust maximum likelihood estimator was used 
      to test how those changes are associated in the training versus the waiting-list 
      group. The training increased wellbeing and all self-transcendent emotions 
      regardless of interindividual variance in the changes across time. Changes in all 
      self-transcendent emotions were positively associated with changes in wellbeing. 
      The strength of those associations was comparable in the waiting-list group and 
      the training group. More studies are needed to test whether the effects of 
      mindfulness practice on wellbeing are driven by increases in self-transcendent 
      emotions. The study was conducted over 6 weeks during the COVID19 pandemic. The 
      results indicate that the mindfulness training can be an easily accessible 
      effective intervention supporting eudaimonic wellbeing in face of adversity.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to 
      improve psychosocial functioning in medical populations but have not been studied 
      in narcolepsy. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an MBI 
      that was adapted for narcolepsy, including three variations in program length. 
      METHODS: Adults with narcolepsy (N = 60) were randomized to MBI groups of varying 
      durations: brief (4 weeks), standard (8 weeks), or extended (12 weeks). 
      Participants completed assessments at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. To assess 
      feasibility and acceptability, primary outcomes included attendance, meditation 
      practice, and data completeness. Additionally, participants completed measures of 
      mindfulness, self-compassion, mood, sleep, psychosocial functioning, and 
      cognition. An effect size of Cohen's d ≥ 0.5 was used as the prespecified 
      benchmark for a minimal clinically important difference (MCID). RESULTS: The 
      attendance, meditation, and data completeness benchmarks were met by 71.7%, 
      61.7%, and 78.3% of participants, respectively. Higher proportions of the brief 
      and extended groups met these benchmarks compared to the standard group. All 
      groups met the MCID for mindfulness, self-compassion, self-efficacy for managing 
      emotions, positive psychosocial impact, global mental health, and fatigue. 
      Standard and extended groups met the MCID for anxiety and depression, and 
      extended groups met the MCID for additional measures including social and 
      cognitive functioning, daytime sleepiness, hypersomnia symptoms, and 
      hypersomnia-related functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the remote 
      delivery and data collection methods are feasible to employ in future clinical 
      trials, and it appears that the extended MBI provides the most favorable clinical 
      impact while maintaining attendance and engagement in meditation practice.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness interventions on prenatal well-being: A systematic 
      review.
PG  - 1415-1434
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low well-being during pregnancy can have significant adverse outcomes 
      for mother and child. The effects of mindfulness interventions on prenatal 
      maternal well-being are increasingly examined but outcomes have yet to be 
      systematically evaluated. The aims of the current paper are to systematically 
      evaluate intervention effects and current research approaches with pregnant 
      groups. DESIGN: A systematic review of eight studies examining mindfulness 
      intervention effects on prenatal well-being. RESULTS: Findings indicate potential 
      benefits of mindfulness interventions for reducing levels of depression, anxiety 
      and negative affect during pregnancy. There is also evidence for improved 
      self-compassion and perceived childbirth self-efficacy. Further, these effects 
      may be more pronounced for vulnerable groups, such as women currently 
      experiencing low prenatal well-being. Less consistent findings were observed for 
      stress, and positive affect. Variations in research design, gestational 
      characteristics, timing of assessments and outcome measurement may explain some 
      inconsistencies in the extant literature. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness interventions 
      present a potentially useful means to improve prenatal well-being but improved 
      methodological quality is essential to rigorously examine intervention effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) seek 
      pleasurable foods to avoid their negative emotional experiences. Ineffective 
      regulation of negative emotions may be a risk factor for emotional eating (EE), 
      leading to suffering, dysfunctional behaviors, and weight gain. OBJECTIVES: The 
      aim of this study is to understand the relationship between emotional 
      dysregulation and EE, investigating potential mediators such as the intensity of 
      the worry, avoidance of internal experiences, mindfulness, and self-compassion in 
      female patients with anxiety. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 
      participants from a randomized clinical trial diagnosed with GAD answered the 
      following instruments at baseline: the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale 
      (DERS), the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21), the Penn State Worry 
      Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Action and Acceptance Questionnaire (AAQ), the Five 
      Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). We 
      estimated Pearson correlation coefficients and performed mediation analyses. 
      RESULTS: We evaluated 51 female individuals, 34 of whom completed all the 
      questionnaires. Our data showed that EE was positively correlated with emotional 
      dysregulation (r = 0.593; p < 0.001), worry trait (r = 0.402; p = 0.018), and 
      avoidance of internal experiences (r = 0.565; p < 0.001), whereas it was 
      negatively correlated with self-compassion (r = -0.590; p < 0.001) and mindful 
      state (r = -0.383; p = 0.026). Moreover, we demonstrated that self-compassion 
      mediates the relationship between emotional dysregulation and EE (ab product 
      estimate = 0.043, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.003-0.084). CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings contribute to the literature by identifying psychological factors that 
      could mediate the association between emotional dysregulation and EE, enabling 
      identification of more effective eating behavior intervention targets for 
      patients with GAD.

TI  - Tele-Mindfulness for Dementia's Family Caregivers: A Randomized Trial with a 
      Usual Care Control Group.
PG  - 364-372

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caring for a family member with dementia is stressful and 
      challenging. Family caregivers, as a vulnerable marginalized population and 
      invisible backbone of the health care system, need accessible and effective 
      interventions that are tailored to their particular needs. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a 
      live online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (tele-MBCT) intervention for 
      family caregivers of individuals with dementia. METHODS: Family caregivers were 
      assigned to a tele-MBCT intervention or a usual care control group. Tele-MBCT 
      participants attended eight weekly live online training and practiced mindfulness 
      practices at home. All participants completed surveys at baseline, 
      post-intervention, and 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: 26 participants (age 60±13 
      years) were enrolled and randomized (14 in the intervention and 12 in the control 
      group), and 92.3% completed the study. 88% of the participants were female, and 
      70% were caring for a parent for a mean of 5.12±2.88 years. 84% of the 
      participants in the intervention group attended at least seven sessions and the 
      average of daily practice was 23.58±45.71 minutes. All participants were 
      satisfied with the intervention, and 88.8% were satisfied with the online 
      delivery method. Participants in the intervention group showed Pre-Post 
      improvement in self-compassion (t (11) = -2.49, p=0.03) and coping strategies (t 
      (11) = 3.62, p=0.004) compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Tele-MBCT is a 
      feasible intervention and may improve psychological outcomes and adaptive coping 
      in family caregivers of individuals with dementia. A larger controlled trial is 
      warranted.

TI  - Mindfulness-based interventions for patients with schizophrenia spectrum 
      disorders: A systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 191-203
LID - S0920-9964(23)00449-8 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged as secular 
      practices, including elements of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and 
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). While MBIs have been widely adopted 
      for physical and mental illness, only a few available programs are explicitly 
      adapted for psychosis. However, previous reviews have reported the vital 
      heterogeneity regarding treatment program structure. Therefore, this review aims 
      to compare the structure of different mindfulness protocols applied to patients 
      with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). METHODS: A systematic search was 
      conducted up to March 2023 in PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo. Following our protocol 
      (CRD 42023253356), we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. RESULTS: We included 22 randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1500 patients SSD. All programs varied in 
      structure, session components, duration, and instructor experience. While 
      MBSR-like programs focused on stress reactivity, MBCT-like programs addressed 
      primary symptoms of psychosis and relapse prevention. Despite the heterogeneity 
      of programs, some common mechanisms emerged, including attention training, 
      emotion and stress regulation, decentering, self-compassion, and cognitive 
      restructuring. CONCLUSIONS: The critical heterogeneity found limits the 
      interpretation of results. However, most recent trials present fewer risks of 
      bias and more homogenous programs. Findings suggested potential benefits, such as 
      reduced negative symptoms, increased well-being, and decreased hospitalization 
      rates. For future studies, authors should align on more congruent MBIs programs 
      for patients with SSD. Further research is needed to identify optimal mindfulness 
      teaching approaches for patients with psychosis and investigate specific 
      mechanisms of action, relevant processes, and optimal doses in varying settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research reveals a high prevalence of stressors in adolescence. 
      Mental health in adolescence is highly related to life-stressors exposure and 
      difficulties in adjusting to stressors. Therefore, interventions for recovery 
      from stress are in high demand. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the 
      Internet-based stress recovery intervention for adolescents. METHODS: A two-arm 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of the FOREST-A-an 
      Internet-based stress recovery intervention for adolescents-will be conducted. 
      The FOREST-A is an adapted version of stress recovery intervention initially 
      developed for healthcare workers. FOREST-A is a third-wave cognitive behavioral 
      therapy and mindfulness-based Internet-delivered 4-week psychosocial 
      intervention, which comprises six modules: Introduction, Relaxation, 
      Psychological detachment, Mastery, Control, and Summary. The intervention will be 
      evaluated using the two-arm RCT with intervention and care as usual (CAU) 
      condition at pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up. The measured outcomes 
      will be stress recovery, adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety and depression 
      symptoms, psychological well-being, and perceived positive social support. 
      DISCUSSION: The study will contribute to the development of Internet 
      interventions-easily and broadly accessible tools-for the enhancement of 
      adolescents' stress recovery skills. Based on the study's findings, further 
      development of the FOREST-A, including upscaling and implementation, is foreseen.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy with 
      Older Adults: A Qualitative Review of Randomized Controlled Outcome Research.
PG  - 347-358
LID - 10.1080/07317115.2018.1518282 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Many older adults cope with various chronic physical health 
      conditions, and in some cases, with mental health and/or cognitive difficulties. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions offer an evidence-based, mind-body complementary 
      treatment approach for a wide range of comorbidities, yet most investigations 
      were conducted with young or middle-aged adults. The purpose of this review was 
      to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two leading mindfulness-based 
      interventions conducted with older adults. Methods: Our search of five databases 
      identified seven RCT investigations of either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
      (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) conducted exclusively with 
      older adults. Results: Results generally supported the use of MBSR for chronic 
      low back pain, chronic insomnia, improved sleep quality, enhanced positive 
      affect, reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improved memory and 
      executive functioning. In a sample of older adults exhibiting elevated anxiety in 
      the absence of elevated depression, MBCT effectively reduced symptoms of anxiety. 
      Conclusions: This review highlights the feasibility and possible benefits of MBSR 
      and MBCT for older adults. Additional large scale RCTs conducted with older 
      adults coping with the range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive challenges 
      older adults commonly face still are needed. Clinical Implications: MBSR may be a 
      promising intervention for older adults experiencing a variety of health concerns 
      and possibly even cognitive decline. MBCT may reduce geriatric anxiety, although 
      its effects on geriatric depression were not measured.

PG  - 608-620
LID - 10.1177/0145721717738019 [doi]
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility, satisfaction, and 
      preliminary effects of Mindful Stress Reduction in Diabetes Education 
      (Mind-STRIDE), a mindfulness-based intervention for veterans. Methods The study 
      used a single-group pretest-posttest repeated-measures design. The 90-minute 
      Mind-STRIDE training, adapted from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), was 
      provided as the final component of a half-day diabetes self-management education 
      class at a Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient diabetes clinic. Following initial 
      training, participants were asked to practice mindfulness at home for 10 minutes 
      each day during the 3-month study. Study recruitment and retention were 
      calculated as rates. Veteran and diabetes educator satisfaction were assessed by 
      rating scales and open-ended comments. Psychosocial-behavioral and metabolic 
      outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months after initial training. Bivariate 
      correlations were performed to describe relationships between mindfulness and 
      other outcome variables. Gain scores and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank tests 
      were used to assess pre to post changes; Cohen's d was applied to estimate the 
      magnitude of effects. Results Twenty-eight of 49 eligible veterans (57%) enrolled 
      in the study. Of those, 11 veterans (39%) demonstrated participation in home 
      practice, and 20 veterans (71%) completed the study. Overall, participants and 
      diabetes educators were highly satisfied with the Mind-STRIDE intervention. 
      Significant improvements were found in diabetes distress, diabetes self-efficacy, 
      diabetes self-management behaviors, mindful-describing, and A1C. Conclusion 
      Results suggest feasibility, satisfaction, and positive preliminary effects. 
      Efficacy testing by randomized controlled trial with analysis of covariance 
      structures is warranted.

TI  - Reports of self-compassion and affect regulation in psilocybin-assisted therapy 
      for alcohol use disorder: An interpretive phenomenological analysis.
PG  - 101-113
LID - 10.1037/adb0000935 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this qualitative study was to delineate 
      psychological mechanisms of change in the first randomized controlled trial of 
      psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD). Theories 
      regarding psychological processes involved in psychedelic therapy remain 
      underdeveloped. METHOD: Participants (N = 13) mostly identified as non-Hispanic 
      and White, with approximately equal proportions of cisgender men and women. 
      Participants engaged in semistructured interviews about their subjective 
      experiences in the study. Questions probed the nature of participants' drinking 
      before and after the study as well as coping patterns in response to strong 
      emotions, stress, and cravings for alcohol. Verbatim transcripts were coded using 
      Dedoose software, and content was analyzed with interpretive phenomenological 
      analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported that the psilocybin treatment helped 
      them process emotions related to painful past events and helped promote states of 
      self-compassion, self-awareness, and feelings of interconnectedness. The acute 
      states during the psilocybin sessions were described as laying the foundation for 
      developing more self-compassionate regulation of negative affect. Participants 
      also described newfound feelings of belonging and an improved quality of 
      relationships following the treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results support the 
      assertion that psilocybin increases the malleability of self-related processing, 
      and diminishes shame-based and self-critical thought patterns while improving 
      affect regulation and reducing alcohol cravings. These findings suggest that 
      psychosocial treatments that integrate self-compassion training with psychedelic 
      therapy may serve as a useful tool for enhancing psychological outcomes in the 
      treatment of AUD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Mobile Apps and Their Impact on Well-Being in Nonclinical 
      Populations: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - e44638
LID - 10.2196/44638 [doi]
LID - e44638
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based mobile apps have become popular tools for enhancing 
      well-being in today's fast-paced world. Their ability to reduce geographical, 
      financial, and social barriers makes them a promising alternative to traditional 
      interventions. OBJECTIVE: As most available apps lack a theoretical framework, 
      this review aimed to evaluate their effectiveness and assess their quality. We 
      expected to find small sample sizes, high dropout rates, and small effect sizes 
      in the included studies. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted 
      using PsycInfo, PsycNet, PubMed, an institutional search engine (u:search), and 
      Google Scholar. Randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of mobile 
      mindfulness apps on well-being in nonclinical samples were included. Study 
      selection, risk of bias (using the version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 
      for randomized trials), and reporting quality (using selected CONSORT 
      [Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials] statement criteria) assessments were 
      performed by 2 authors independently and discussed until a consensus was reached. 
      RESULTS: The 28 included randomized controlled trials differed in well-being 
      measures, apps, and intervention duration (7 to 56 days; median duration 28 
      days). A wide range of sample sizes (12 to 2282; median 161) and attrition rates 
      (0% to 84.7%; median rate 23.4%) were observed. Most studies (19/28, 68%) 
      reported positive effects on at least one aspect of well-being. The effects were 
      presented using different metrics but were primarily small or small to medium in 
      size. Overall risk of bias was mostly high. CONCLUSIONS: The wide range of sample 
      sizes, attrition rates, and intervention periods and the variation in well-being 
      measures and mobile apps contributed to the limited comparability of the studies. 
      Although most studies (16/28, 57%) reported small or small to medium effects for 
      at least one well-being outcome, this review demonstrates that the 
      generalizability of the results is limited. Further research is needed to obtain 
      more consistent conclusions regarding the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps 
      on well-being in nonclinical populations.

LID - e0270683
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is a common occurrence among women during the 
      perinatal period. Maternal psychological distress (MPS) can also have a negative 
      influence on neonatal outcomes such as infant health, child development or 
      mother-child interaction. Hence, interventions to improve mental wellbeing during 
      this period are vital. Mindfulness based intervention (MBI) has been found to be 
      effective in reducing psychological distress. Delivery of MBI via the internet, 
      making it accessible and inexpensive, is showing a promising positive effect in 
      reducing psychological distress. A randomized control trial with sufficient power 
      is required to confirm its positive effect among pregnant women. The positive 
      effects of MBI have been found to be associated with heart rate variability (HRV) 
      biofeedback; however, the efficacy of MBI on HRV has been rarely studied among 
      pregnant women. Also, the potential association of HRV with MBI and psychological 
      wellbeing needs further examination. This research aims to test the effectiveness 
      of guided mobile-based perinatal mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI) among pregnant 
      women experiencing psychological distress during the pre- and post-natal period, 
      as well as examining the efficacy of GMBPMI on HRV. METHOD: This study is a 
      randomized controlled trial that follows a parallel design. Consenting pregnant 
      women in their second trimester (between 12th and 20th week gestation) will be 
      randomly assigned to an intervention group (GMBPMI) or a control group 
      (psychoeducation). The intended sample size is 198, with 99 participants in each 
      group. Three levels of outcomes will be measured at baseline, post intervention 
      in both the intervention and control groups, and at 36-week gestation and 
      five-week postpartum. The primary outcomes include maternal psychological stress, 
      mindfulness and positive appraisal HRV. Secondary outcomes are psychological and 
      physical wellbeing. Tertiary outcomes include obstetric and neonatal outcomes, 
      and social support. Analyses will follow an intention-to-treat method and 
      repeated measures MANOVA will be conducted to compare changes in primary and 
      secondary outcomes. A series of mixed-effects models will be fitted to assess the 
      mediation effects. DISCUSSION: This trial expects to increase understanding of 
      GMBPMI on HRV and psychological wellbeing for pregnant women, with extended 
      support in both pre-and post-natal periods. The study could also potentially 
      provide evidence for delivery of cost-effective and accessible services to 
      pregnant women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04876014, registered

AB  - Self-compassion interventions may be uniquely suited to address body image 
      distress (BID), as change-based strategies may have limited utility in a cultural 
      context that so highly values appearance. The current study evaluated a version 
      of an Internet-based self-compassion training, which had previously shown 
      promising results, but was limited by high attrition. The intervention period was 
      reduced from three weeks to one week in the present study to improve retention. 
      Eighty undergraduate women endorsing body image concerns were randomized to 
      either self-compassion meditation training or a waitlist control group. Results 
      suggest that brief exposure to the basic tenets of self-compassion holds promise 
      for improving aspects of self-compassion and BID. Attrition was minimal, but 
      compliance with meditation practice instructions during the week was low. Efforts 
      are needed to improve engagement, but this approach has the potential to be an 
      acceptable and cost effective method to reduce BID.

TI  - Efficacy of Meditation-Based Interventions on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
      (PTSD) Among Veterans: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decades of research have documented post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) symptoms in war veterans. Current treatment options for PTSD are 
      unappealing as they either require re-exposure to the traumatic event or 
      medications that are greatly impacted by comorbidities. Meditation-based 
      interventions are a promising alternative. However, there is a dearth of research 
      examining their impact. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      examine meditation-based interventions tested for efficacy in treating PTSD among 
      veterans and provide collective evidence. METHODS: Authors searched the MEDLINE 
      and CINAHL databases for relevant studies using the following inclusion criteria: 
      (1) published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) conducted between January 2014 and 
      July 2020; (3) described the evaluation of interventions; and (4) incorporated 
      quantitative or mixed methods. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: U.S. 
      Veterans. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (ten articles) met the inclusion 
      criteria. Four tested Transcendental Meditation (n = 4), three tested Mantra 
      Meditation (n = 3), two tested Mindful Meditation (n = 2), one tested 
      Breathing-based Meditation (n = 1), one tested Mindfulness-based Exposure Therapy 
      (n = 1), one tested Cognitively-based Compassion Training Meditation (n = 1), one 
      tested Mantra Meditation and Mindfulness-based Treatment (n = 1), one tested 
      Mindfulness-based PTSD Treatment (n = 1), and one tested Primary Care Brief 
      Mindfulness Program (n = 1). The most common duration was 8 weeks (n = 8) and the 
      most common evaluation design was the randomized controlled trial (n = 10). The 
      most common outcome measure was the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (n = 
      12). CONCLUSION: All interventions reported improvements in PTSD symptoms. Based 
      on this review, meditation-based therapy is a promising approach for managing 
      PTSD, particularly among veterans resistant to trauma-focused therapies. 
      Randomized control trials with large sample sizes that apply CAPS as their 
      primary outcome measure, and take into account effect size, attrition rates, and 
      blinding are recommended for further research.

TI  - Mindfulness-based schema therapy and forgiveness therapy among women affected by 
      infidelity: A randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 104-116
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2021.1913294 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Infidelity causes mental health problems, family disruptions, 
      rumination about events and changes in women's beliefs about the disloyal person. 
      This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based schema (MBS) 
      therapy and forgiveness therapy in emotional responses, cognitive distortions and 
      self-compassion of women affected by infidelity. Method: It was an experimental 
      research with a pretest-posttest and follow-up design. Eighty-one women affected 
      by infidelity were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control 
      group. The experimental groups received interventions for ten 90-minute weekly 
      sessions. Participants completed the questionnaires in the pretest, post-test and 
      follow-up. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for statistical 
      analysis. Results: Both experimental groups were significantly different from the 
      control group (p<.01). Forgiveness therapy was more effective in emotional 
      responses and self-compassion in the post-test (p<.01) and follow-up (p<.001) 
      stages. MBS therapy was more effective in cognitive distortions in the post-test 
      and follow-up stages (p<.001). Participants of experimental groups were 
      responders and satisfied with treatment and had a good therapeutic relationship. 
      Conclusion: Given the type of problems faced by women affected by infidelity, 
      forgiveness therapy and MBS therapy can be used to reduce mental sufferings and 
      communication problems.

AB  - To examine the dose-response effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) 
      for college students with major depressive disorder (MDD), a randomized control 
      trial with MBCT and a wait-list (WL) group was performed. All participants were 
      invited to self-administer a set of questionnaires at baseline, mid-intervention 
      (4th week), and post-intervention (8th week) by the 9-item Patient Health 
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire 
      (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). The serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, 
      TNF-α, BDNF were detected at baseline and post-intervention. After intervention, 
      the scores of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSQI, and the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α 
      in the MBCT were significantly lower than those in WL group, and total scores of 
      FFMQ, SCS, and the level of BDNF were significantly higher than those in WL 
      group. In MBCT group, daily practice time and session numbers positively related 
      to reduction rates of PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PSQI at post-intervention. The reduction 
      rate of PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PSQI at post-intervention in the completers were higher 
      significantly than those in the partial attendees. These findings suggested MBCT 
      is effective for MDD, and the intervention has a dose-response effect. TRIAL

AB  - Weight stigma is highly prevalent. However, existing weight stigma interventions 
      are only modestly effective at reducing anti-fat attitudes. The current research 
      proposes a novel approach using a loving kindness meditation (LKM). Experiment 1 
      tests whether random assignment to the LKM intervention reduces explicit and 
      implicit anti-fat bias and increases empathy based on the LKM recipient with 
      higher weight (close other vs. stranger). Experiment 2 tests whether LKM 
      outperforms an empathy intervention or control to increase empathy or reduce 
      stigmatizing behavior. Results revealed that the LKM increased empathic care but 
      did not reduce anti-fat bias compared to control; the LKM intervention, but not 
      the empathy intervention, reported greater empathy compared to control in 
      unadjusted analyses; and participants in the LKM and empathy interventions (vs. 
      control) were more likely to engage in stigmatizing behavior. These findings 
      suggest that the LKM may not be effective at reducing weight stigma despite 
      increasing empathy.

TI  - An online mindfulness intervention for medical students in South Africa: A 
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1840

LID - 1840
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an association was observed between 
      medical students' stress, possibly because of an intensive academic workload and 
      clinical responsibilities, and mental ill health. The literature has shown the 
      benefit of online mindfulness interventions for different mental health 
      challenges. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on their benefit to 
      medical students in South Africa. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore 
      whether medical students attending an online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) 
      would show improved resilience and stress management compared with attendance at 
      an online supportive counselling (SC) programme. Secondary to this was the 
      viability of the intervention, for which an in-depth understanding of 
      participants' experiences was sought. SETTING: The study setting was online 
      through https://zoom.us/. METHODS: Forty-five participants were randomly 
      allocated between two 6-week, teacher-facilitated groups. A repeated measures 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) of outcome, well-being, perceived stress and 
      self-compassion scores conducted at three time points, as well as thematic 
      analysis of participant feedback, contributed to quantitative and qualitative 
      data. RESULTS: Participants in both the groups showed significant improvement 
      over time in measures of well-being, perceived stress and subjective stress 
      management. Participants in the mindfulness group showed a statistically 
      significant treatment effect in mindfulness at programme completion. A decrease 
      in self-compassion over time was observed in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The 
      results of this study indicate that in this South African medical student cohort, 
      an online MBI and a SC programme are both feasible and show potential for 
      reducing stress, increasing stress management and increasing resilience. Further 
      study in this area is recommended.

AB  - The current study was designed to extend previous research by testing whether 
      self-compassion acts as a protective factor that facilitates faster affective and 
      physiological recovery from stress in people with elevated depressive symptoms. 
      Specifically, we examined the effect of experimentally induced self-compassion on 
      positive affect, negative affect, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) recovery 
      from stress. Participants (N = 59) experiencing elevated depressive symptoms 
      completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized psychosocial 
      stressor, and then were randomly assigned to either a self-compassion induction 
      or a no-strategy control induction before resting quietly during the 30-min 
      recovery period. During the induction period, participants in the self-compassion 
      condition exhibited a greater increase in positive affect and a trend towards a 
      greater decrease in negative affect than did participants in the no-strategy 
      control condition. However, the psychological benefits of self-compassion did not 
      continue during the post-induction recovery period. Moreover, changes in RSA 
      levels did not differ between participants in the self-compassion and no-strategy 
      control condition. These results suggest that, among individuals with elevated 
      depressive symptoms, brief self-compassion inductions have short-term beneficial 
      psychological, but not physiological, effects. As such, our findings delineate 
      the benefits and boundaries of single-session self-compassion inductions in 
      depression, and in doing so, inform future experimental and applied research.

TI  - Effects of a Neuroscience-Based Mindfulness Meditation Program on Psychological 
      Health: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness and meditation have a rich historical tradition, and a 
      growing scientific base of evidence supports their use in creating positive 
      psychological and neuroplastic changes for practitioners. Although meditation can 
      be taught in various ways, the scientific community has yet to systematically 
      study the impact of different types of meditation on neuropsychological outcomes, 
      especially as it pertains to digital implementation. Therefore, it is critical 
      that the instruction of mindfulness be evidence based because meditation is being 
      used in both scientific and clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated 
      the use of teacher cueing and the integration of neuroscience education into a 
      meditation program. Compassion cueing was chosen as the element of experimental 
      manipulation because traditional lineages of Buddhist meditation teach compassion 
      for self and others as one of the primary outcomes of meditation. We hypothesized 
      that participants receiving compassion cueing would have enhanced 
      neuropsychological outcomes compared with those receiving functional cueing and 
      that gains in neuroscience knowledge would relate to positive neuropsychological 
      outcomes. METHODS: Participants (n=89) were randomized to receive either 
      functional cueing (control group) or compassion cueing (experimental group) and 
      engaged with five 10-minute meditation sessions a week for 4 weeks. All 
      intervention sessions were administered through digital presentation. All 
      participants completed ecological momentary assessments before and after the 
      daily intervention, as well as pre- and postintervention questionnaires. RESULTS: 
      Participants demonstrated significant benefits over time, including increased 
      mindfulness and self-compassion, decreased depression, and gains in neuroscience 
      content (all P<.001); however, no significant between-group differences were 
      found. Daily scores from each day of the intervention showed a statistically 
      significant shift from active toward settled. Importantly, long-term increases in 
      mindfulness were positively correlated to changes in compassion (r=0.326; P=.009) 
      and self-compassion (r=0.424; P<.001) and negatively correlated to changes in 
      anxiety (r=-0.266; P=.03) and depression (r=-0.271; P=.03). Finally, the acute 
      effects of meditation were significantly correlated to the longitudinal outcomes 
      (with a small-to-medium effect size), especially those relevant to mindfulness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel neuroscience-based education-meditation program 
      that enhanced self-regulation as evidenced by improved mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and mood state. Our findings demonstrate the behavioral 
      importance of engaging with mindfulness meditation and reinforce the idea that 
      the benefits of meditation are independent of teacher cueing behavior. Future 
      studies will need to investigate the brain-based changes underlying these 
      meditation-induced outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a rising demand for methods to support well-being at work. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to enhance nurses' 
      psychological well-being. PURPOSE: To identify mindfulness-based interventions 
      and outcome measures and to evaluate the effect on the psychological well-being 
      of nurses. METHODS: A systematic review following Prisma protocol with search of 
      four electronic databases was undertaken covering English language publications 
      between January 2011 and July 2021. FINDINGS: A total of 11 randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies with a total of 1009 participants were 
      included. The outcome measures were stress, depression, anxiety, burnout, 
      resilience, quality of life, self-compassion, happiness, and the level of 
      mindfulness. Ten studies demonstrated positive impact of mindfulness-based 
      intervention on nurses' psychological well-being. DISCUSSION: Mindfulness-based 
      interventions have the potential to enhance the well-being of nurses. RCTs using 
      rigorous designs, consistent outcome measures and bigger sample sizes are 
      required to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence shows small positive effects associated with psychological 
      treatments for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). In a recent meta-analysis, 
      the treatment with the largest effect size was a mindfulness-based intervention 
      (MBI). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether an Internet-delivered MBI was 
      beneficial for PwMS. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate history of recurrent 
      depression as a moderator of treatment outcome. METHODS: Participants (N = 132) 
      were assessed based on whether they had a history of recurrent depression, then 
      stratified and randomized to MBI or waitlist. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 
      post-intervention, and 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The MBI group reported 
      significantly improved depressive symptoms (primary outcome) compared with the 
      waitlist (p = 0.046, Cohen's d = 0.39). Those with a history of recurrent 
      depression benefitted significantly more than those without (p = 0.034, 
      d = 0.66). There were benefits for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the 
      MBI, irrespective of depression history (p = 0.009, d = 0.5). Pain interference 
      was less overall in the MBI group (p < 0.001, d = 0.2), but change over time did 
      not differ from waitlist. There were no treatment effects for anxiety, pain 
      severity or fatigue. CONCLUSION: The Internet-delivered MBI significantly 
      improved depressive symptoms and HRQoL in PwMS. For depression, the benefits were 
      greater for those with a history of recurrent depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      in cancer survivors: Predictors of treatment response.
PG  - 100365
LID - 10.1016/j.invent.2021.100365 [doi]
LID - 100365
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study investigates possible predictors of treatment 
      response in an Internet-delivered Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (iMBCT) 
      intervention with therapist support. This iMBCT program, a fully online delivered 
      intervention with asynchronous therapist support, has previously been shown to be 
      efficacious in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in women treated for 
      breast cancer and men treated for prostate cancer. METHODS: Eighty-two breast- 
      and prostate cancer survivors experiencing psychological distress received 
      8 weeks of therapist-guided iMBCT. Primary outcomes were improvement in anxiety 
      and depression scores from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to 
      six-months follow-up. Clinical predictors included levels of depression and 
      anxiety at the time of screening and at baseline, as well as time since 
      diagnosis. Demographic predictors included age and educational level. 
      Therapy-related predictors included working alliance, self-compassion, and five 
      facets of mindfulness. Mixed Linear Models were employed to test the prediction 
      effects over time. RESULTS: Higher levels of baseline depression were associated 
      with increased treatment response in anxiety at post-treatment, and lower levels 
      of self-compassion were associated with increased treatment response in 
      depression at post-treatment. None of the proposed predictors significantly 
      predicted treatment response at six-months follow-up. CONCLUSION: The findings 
      suggest that iMBCT can be provided for cancer survivors regardless of their age, 
      educational level, and time since diagnosis (up to five years) and that 
      therapeutic alliance is not crucial for treatment response. We did not identify 
      characteristics predicting treatment response, although many factors were tested. 
      Still, other characteristics may be predictors, and given the relatively small 
      sample size and a large number of statistical tests, the results should be 
      interpreted with caution.

TI  - The effect of mindfulness therapy in acromegaly, a pilot study.
PG  - 363-374
LID - 10.1111/cen.14844 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with acromegaly have often several comorbidities, including 
      decreased quality of life, mood alterations and chronic pain. Mindfulness is 
      effective at improving mood, quality of life and pain management; however, there 
      is no data available on its effect in patients with acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: We 
      aimed at evaluating changes in quality of life, mood, pain, sleep, 
      self-compassion, life satisfaction, blood pressure and heart rate after a 
      mindfulness program. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This was a randomized, multicentre, 
      international clinical trial (Barcelona-BCN and Bergamo-BG) of 60 patients, 30 
      per centre. MEASUREMENTS: The intervention group participated in an 8-week 
      face-to-face group program; the control group followed normal clinical routine. 
      In BG, patients performed a classic Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program; 
      in BCN they performed an adapted program including elements of mindfulness and 
      compassion with a greater focus on daily life. RESULTS: In the BCN intervention 
      group there was an increase in night-time hours in bed (p = 0.05) after the 
      program. In both centres there was a trend to a reduction of the time to start 
      sleeping (p = 0.06 BCN, p = 0.07 BG). In BCN, the intervention group reduced the 
      pain score compared to the control group (p = .02), and an improvement in 
      self-compassion was found (p = .04). In both centres, heart rate decreased 
      significantly in the intervention group during a single 2-hour session. This was 
      evidenced at the first and the last program session (BCN p = .013 and p = .009; 
      BG < 0.001 and p = .04). A training effect was found in BG, where heart rate fell 
      more in the last session than in the first (p = 002). CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      demonstrated for the first time the value of a mindfulness program in patients 
      with acromegaly, analysing possible effects and advantages, and clarifying the 
      usefulness of a specific protocol for the disease.

AB  - Major depression is one of the most common mental health problems worldwide. More 
      than one-third of patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In 
      this study, we explored the feasibility of group compassion-focused therapy (CFT) 
      for TRD using a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. Eighteen 
      participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group (CFT and usual 
      care) and control group (usual care alone) and a participant in each group 
      withdrew. Participants in the intervention group received a 1.5-h session every 
      week for 12 weeks. The effects of the intervention on the participants' scores 
      were calculated using a linear mixed model. There was a larger reduction in their 
      depressive symptoms and fears of compassion for self and a greater increase in 
      their compassion for self compared to the control group participants. The 
      reliable clinical indices showed that in the CFT (intervention) group, three of 
      nine participants recovered (33%), two improved (22%), two recovered but 
      non-reliably (22%), and the condition of two remained unchanged (22%). These 
      findings indicate adequate feasibility of group CFT for TRD in Japanese clinical 
      settings. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier

TI  - Mindfulness and bodily distress.
PG  - B4547
AB  - We have created a mindfulness approach to treat patients who experience multiple, 
      persistent, and disabling physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a 
      well-defined medical or surgical condition. Randomized controlled trials in this 
      area are few, and research is hampered by the lack of clear definitions. Bodily 
      distress syndrome (BDS) or bodily stress is an empirically defined definition 
      unifying various conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and 
      somatization disorder. In the present PhD, we explored whether patients suffering 
      from BDS may be committed to mental training in the form of mindfulness therapy, 
      which is a mindfulness program specifically targeted patients suffering from BDS. 
      The theoretical model for including mindfulness training in the treatment of BDS 
      is based on identified neurobiological impairments in these patients and the 
      neurobiological improvements that mindfulness training may offer. BDS is a major 
      public health issue possibly associated with the pathology of the 
      immuno-endocrine and autonomic nervous system. BDS patients are often 
      stigmatized, and effective treatment is rarely delivered, which leaves these 
      patients isolated, left by themselves, vulnerable to potentially harming medical 
      and/or alternative treatments. Accordingly, there is a need for non-harming 
      practical tools that patients can learn to master so that they can improve the 
      ability to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing. 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a group program that employs 
      mindfulness practice to alleviate suffering associated with physical, 
      psychosomatic, and psychiatric disorders. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy 
      (MBCT) is designed to prevent depressive relapse. Paper I and II present 
      systematic literature reviews only of randomized controlled trials on MBSR and 
      MBCT. The effect of MBSR has been explored on fibromyalgia in three studies, none 
      of them showed convincing results, but gave some indications as to improvement. 
      The reviews recommended MBSR as a useful method for improving mental health; 
      however, lack of long-term follow-up and active control groups are limitations in 
      most studies. MBCT was recommended as a tool for preventing depressive relapse in 
      recovered, recurrently depressed patients, but the implication of MBSR and MBCT 
      is problematic, especially due to the lack of well educated mindfulness teachers. 
      We combined MBSR with cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, specifically targeted 
      BDS. Paper III provides original data from 119 patients enrolled in a randomized 
      clinical trial, mindfulness therapy for BDS. The randomized controlled trial 
      indicates that BDS patients are capable of and willing to engage in mindfulness 
      therapy. This thesis showed that mindfulness therapy can safely and successfully 
      engage BDS patients in mindfulness practice. Since individual CBT and psychiatric 
      consultation have previously been found to have positive outcomes for BDS 
      patients, we compared mindfulness therapy to an active control group entitled 
      specialized treatment in which an individual treatment was planned in 
      collaboration between the patient and an MD specialized in BDS, CBT, and 
      psychiatry. Mindfulness therapy was comparable to specialized treatment in 
      improving the quality of life and the symptoms of the patients with BDS at 
      15-month follow-up. For primary outcome physical health (PCS) at 15-month 
      follow-up, different developments over time for the two treatment groups could 
      not be established (F(3,2674) = 1.51, p = 0.21). However, in the mindfulness 
      therapy group, PCS significant changed at the end of treatment and this change 
      remained at 15-month follow-up, whereas no significantly change was seen in the 
      specialized treatment group until at the 15-month follow-up. In the mindfulness 
      therapy group, 26%; CI: 14-38 reported a marked improvement (> 1 SD) at the end 
      of treatment compared with 10%; CI: 2-18 in the specialized treatment group. This 
      amounts to a statistically significant difference between the groups (OR = 3.21; 
      CI 1.05-9.78, p = 0.04). The results are indicating that mindfulness therapy 
      produced greater and more rapid improvements than specialized treatment. 
      Mindfulness therapy appears to produce improvements within the range of those 
      reported in the STreSS-1 trial, where CBT was compared with enhanced usual care, 
      and no improvements on the SF-36 scale were observed in the enhanced usual care 
      group. This indicates that the changes accomplished with the two treatments 
      mindfulness therapy and specialized treatment reflect real changes attributable 
      to the interventions. The economic effects of mindfulness therapy are evaluated 
      in paper IV by the use of original register data from the 119 enrolled patients 
      and a matched control group of 5,950 individuals. Mindfulness therapy had 
      substantial socioeconomic benefits over specialized treatment. The costs incurred 
      to cover permanent health-related benefits, especially disability pension, were 
      significantly lower in the mindfulness therapy group than in the specialized 
      treatment group over a 15-month follow-up period; 25% from the mindfulness 
      therapy group received disability pension compared with 45% from the specialized 
      treatment group (p = 0.025). The total health care utilization was reduced over 
      time in both groups from the year before inclusion (mean $ 5,325, median $ 2,971) 
      to the year after inclusion (mean $ 3,644, median $ 1,593) (p = 0.0001). There 
      was no difference between the two groups. Five and ten years before their 
      inclusion, the BDS patients were less self-supporting than an age-, gender- and 
      ethnicity-matched population control group; the BDS patients accumulated more 
      weeks of sickness benefit and unemployment. Thus, the included BDS patients may 
      have been ill and in high risk for a social decline five and ten years before 
      they received a proper diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, the social and 
      economic consequences of BDS are significant and mindfulness therapy may have a 
      potential to significantly improve function, quality of life and symptoms, 
      prevent a social decline, and reduce societal costs.

TI  - Working on self-compassion online: A proof of concept and feasibility study.
PG  - 64-70
LID - 10.1016/j.invent.2016.10.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low self-compassion has repeatedly been associated with 
      psychopathology. There are many promising face-to-face group format interventions 
      focusing on self-compassion. We investigated the feasibility of an online 
      self-compassion program. DESIGN: A feasibility and proof-of-concept study of an 
      online adapted Mindfulness-based Compassionate Living (MBCL) program. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Self-referred participants suffering from harsh self-criticism (N = 
      39) were offered an online program and were asked to complete outcome measures at 
      baseline, after 8 weeks (post-intervention) and after 14 weeks (follow-up). 
      INTERVENTION: The online program consisted of seven sessions, including a first 
      session introducing mindfulness and mindfulness meditation followed by a 
      six-session adaptation of the MBCL program. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) was the primary outcome measure. 
      Secondary outcome measures were the Forms of Self-criticizing/Attacking and 
      Self-reassuring Scale (FSCRS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the 
      Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experience (CHIME), the Fear of 
      Self-compassion (FSC), and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). 
      Additionally, we assessed satisfaction with the program and negative effects 
      related to the program. Furthermore, we used several measures of program usage 
      (number of processed modules, number of logins, time spent in the program, number 
      of diary entries, number of entries in completed exercises). RESULTS: 
      Self-compassion, mindfulness, reassuring-self and satisfaction with life 
      significantly increased whereas inadequate self, hated self, perceived stress and 
      fear of self-compassion significantly decreased from pre- to the 8-week 
      assessment. Results remained stable from post- to the 6-week follow-up. 
      Pre-to-post within-effect sizes were medium to large (ds = 0.50-1.50) and 
      comparable to those found within a face-to-face group format in a similar sample. 
      Time spent in the program significantly predicted self-compassion at post. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study are promising. However, they must be 
      seen as preliminary since replication in a randomized controlled trial, with 
      clinical measures/diagnoses and a longer follow-up period, is necessary.

TI  - A pilot randomized trial of self-compassion writing for young adult women engaged 
      in emotional eating in the context of appearance-related cyberbullying.
PG  - 1520-1533
LID - 10.1002/eat.23967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a 10-min self-compassion writing 
      in alleviating body dissatisfaction, self-objectification, and emotional eating 
      in young adult women engaged in emotional eating in the context of 
      appearance-related cyberbullying. METHOD: A total of 175 Chinese young adult 
      women (M(age)  = 20.90, SD = 1.65) were randomly assigned to one of the three 
      groups: self-compassion, distraction, or control group. At baseline, participants 
      completed assessments of trait and state body dissatisfaction, trait 
      self-objectification, trait self-compassion, emotional eating, and positive and 
      negative affect. Then they needed to recall an appearance-related cyberbullying 
      victimization experience, after which state body dissatisfaction, state 
      self-objectification, and positive and negative affect were measured. After the 
      intervention, participants completed measures of state body dissatisfaction, 
      state self-objectification, positive and negative affect, state self-compassion, 
      and a food-choosing task. At 1-month follow-up, participants completed measures 
      of trait body dissatisfaction, trait self-objectification, trait self-compassion, 
      and emotional eating. RESULTS: At post-intervention, state body dissatisfaction 
      and negative affect were significantly lower, and positive affect was 
      significantly higher in both the self-compassion and distraction groups compared 
      to control. State self-objectification was significantly lower in the 
      self-compassion group than in the other two groups. At 1-month follow-up, the 
      self-compassion group showed significantly lower levels of body dissatisfaction 
      than the control group. DISCUSSION: The findings provide initial evidence for the 
      potential of self-compassion writing in reducing state self-objectification and 
      state body dissatisfaction in the context of appearance-related cyberbullying. 
      PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Appearance-related cyberbullying, a common phenomenon in 
      social networking sites, has been documented to associate with appearance-related 
      concerns and disordered eating in young adult women. However, effective 
      interventions that can reduce these negative associations are scarce. This study 
      preliminarily found that a brief self-compassion writing could be a potential 
      intervention for reducing state self-objectification and state body 
      dissatisfaction in young adult women who had suffered appearance-related 
      cyberbullying.

TI  - Common and Dissociable Neural Activity After Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
      and Relaxation Response Programs.
PG  - 439-451
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000590 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated common and dissociable neural and psychological 
      correlates of two widely used meditation-based stress reduction programs. 
      METHODS: Participants were randomized to the Relaxation Response (RR; n = 18; 56% 
      female) or the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; n = 16; 56% female) 
      programs. Both programs use a "bodyscan" meditation; however, the RR program 
      explicitly emphasizes physical relaxation during this practice, whereas the MBSR 
      program emphasizes mindful awareness with no explicit relaxation instructions. 
      After the programs, neural activity during the respective meditation was 
      investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Both programs 
      were associated with reduced stress (for RR, from 14.1 ± 6.6 to 11.3 ± 5.5 
      [Cohen's d = 0.50; for MBSR, from 17.7 ± 5.7 to 11.9 ± 5.0 [Cohen's d = 1.02]). 
      Conjunction analyses revealed functional coupling between ventromedial prefrontal 
      regions and supplementary motor areas (p < .001). The disjunction analysis 
      indicated that the RR bodyscan was associated with stronger functional 
      connectivity of the right inferior frontal gyrus-an important hub of intentional 
      inhibition and control-with supplementary motor areas (p < .001, family-wise 
      error [FWE] rate corrected). The MBSR program was uniquely associated with 
      improvements in self-compassion and rumination, and the within-group analysis of 
      MBSR bodyscan revealed significant functional connectivity of the right anterior 
      insula-an important hub of sensory awareness and salience-with pregenual anterior 
      cingulate during bodyscan meditation compared with rest (p = .03, FWE corrected). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The bodyscan exercises in each program were associated with both 
      overlapping and differential functional coupling patterns, which were consistent 
      with each program's theoretical foundation. These results may have implications 
      for the differential effects of these programs for the treatment of diverse 
      conditions.

TI  - Boosting Empathy and Compassion Through Mindfulness-Based and Socioemotional 
      Dyadic Practice: Randomized Controlled Trial With App-Delivered Trainings.
PG  - e45027
LID - 10.2196/45027 [doi]
LID - e45027
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemplative trainings have been found to effectively improve social 
      skills such as empathy and compassion. However, there is a lack of research on 
      the efficacy of app-delivered mindfulness-based and dyadic practices in boosting 
      socioaffective capacity. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to compare a 
      novel app-delivered, partner-based socioemotional intervention (Affect Dyad) with 
      mindfulness-based training to foster empathy and compassion for the self or 
      others. The second aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms 
      of these effects. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 
      socioemotional and mindfulness-based interventions and a waitlist control group, 
      which received socioemotional training after the postintervention assessment. We 
      used linear mixed-effects models to test intervention effects on self-report 
      measures and an ecologically valid computer task of empathy, compassion for the 
      self and others, and theory of mind. Moderated mediation models were used to 
      investigate whether changes in acceptance, empathic distress, empathic listening, 
      interoceptive awareness, and mindfulness served as underlying psychological 
      processes of intervention effects. RESULTS: In 218 participants (mean age 44.12, 
      SD 11.71 years; 160/218, 73.4% female), we found all interventions to have 
      positive effects on composite scores for compassion toward the self 
      (β(socioemotional)=.44, P<.001; β(waitlist socioemotional)=.30, P=.002; 
      β(mindfulness-based)=.35, P<.001) and others (β(socioemotional)=.24, P=.003; 
      β(waitlist socioemotional)=.35, P<.001; β(mindfulness-based)=.29, P<.001). 
      Compassion measured with the computer task did not change significantly but 
      showed a trend toward increase only in socioemotional dyadic practice 
      (β(socioemotional)=.08, P=.08; β(waitlist socioemotional)=.11, P=.06). Similarly, 
      on the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, a 
      nonsignificant trend toward increase was found in the socioemotional intervention 
      group (β(socioemotional)=.17; P=.08). Empathy significantly increased in both 
      socioemotional groups (β(socioemotional)=.16, P=.03; β(waitlist 
      socioemotional)=.35, P<.001) and the mindfulness-based group 
      (β(mindfulness-based)=.15; P=.04). The measures of theory of mind did not change 
      over time. In the mindfulness-based group, the increase in self-compassion was 
      mediated by a decrease in empathic distress (indirect effect 
      ab(mindfulness-based)=0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.14). In the socioemotional group, an 
      increase in self-compassion could be predicted by an increase in acceptance 
      (β(socioemotional)=6.63, 95% CI 0.52-12.38). CONCLUSIONS: Using a multimethod 
      approach, this study shows that app-delivered socioemotional and 
      mindfulness-based trainings are effective in fostering compassion for the self 
      and others in self-report. Both low-dose trainings could boost behavioral empathy 
      markers; however, the effects on behavioral and dispositional markers of 
      compassion only trended after dyadic practice, yet these effects did not reach 
      statistical significance. Training-related increases in self-compassion rely on 
      differential psychological processes, that is, on improved empathic distress 
      regulation through mindfulness-based training and the activation of a human care- 
      and acceptance-based system through socioemotional dyadic training. TRIAL

TI  - Abridged mindfulness intervention to support wellness in first-year medical 
      students.
PG  - 350-6
LID - 10.1080/10401334.2014.945025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical students experience a high burden of stress and suffer 
      elevated rates of depression, burnout, and suicide compared to the general 
      population, yet there is no consensus on how to address student wellness. 
      PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an abridged 
      mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention can improve measures of 
      wellness in a randomized sample of 1st-year medical students. METHODS: 
      Fifty-eight participants were randomized to control or 8-week MBSR intervention 
      and then invited to participate in the study. All participants were assessed 
      using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Resilience Scale (RS), and 
      Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) at 3 separate time points: baseline, at the 
      conclusion of the study intervention (8 weeks), and at 6 months after the 
      conclusion of the intervention. The intervention consisted of 75 minutes of 
      weekly class time, suggested meditation at home, and a half-day retreat in the 
      last week. RESULTS: The intervention group achieved significant increase on SCS 
      scores both at the conclusion of the study (0.58, p=.002), 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) [0.23, 0.92], and at 6 months (0.56, p=.001), 95% CI [0.25, 0.87]. 
      PSS scores achieved significant reduction at the conclusion of the study (3.63, 
      p=.03), 95% CI [0.37, 6.89], but not at 6 months poststudy (2.91, p=.08), 95% CI 
      [-0.37, 6.19]. The study did not demonstrate a difference in RS after the 
      intervention, though RS was significantly correlated with both SCS and PSS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An abridged MBSR intervention improves perceived stress and 
      self-compassion in 1st-year medical students and may be a valuable curricular 
      tool to enhance wellness and professional development.
