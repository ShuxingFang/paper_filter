AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an enduring pattern of instability across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal domains. Individuals with BPD are known to be particularly vulnerable to experiences of social rejection, but little work has examined strategies that may moderate their reactivity to social rejection. Using a laboratory experimental approach, this study investigated the effects of brief mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) inductions on emotional and behavioral responses to social rejection in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. One hundred and eighteen participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 min of mindful breathing practice, LKM, or a no-instruction control condition, prior to exposure to a social rejection manipulation. Participants rated their emotions and completed a competitive reaction time task, which provided a proxy measure of aggression. Compared to the control condition, the mindfulness group demonstrated significantly quicker recovery in negative affect and feelings of rejection after social rejection. The mindfulness group also reported significantly quicker recovery in negative affect compared to the LKM group. Whereas baseline trait mindfulness negatively predicted aggressive behaviors across all participants, groups did not differ in immediate emotional reactivity or aggressive behavior following social rejection. The findings suggest that mindfulness training may be a promising strategy in alleviating negative emotional effects of social rejection among individuals with high borderline personality traits, and highlight the limited utility of brief LKM practice in buffering the effects of social rejection.

AB  - Self-compassion is conceptualized as containing 3 core components: self-kindness versus self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus overidentification, when relating to painful experiences. Research evidence demonstrates that self-compassion is related to psychological flourishing and reduced psychopathology. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) is an 8-week training program, meeting 2.5 hours each week, designed to help participants cultivate self-compassion. MSC contains a variety of meditations (e.g., loving-kindness, affectionate breathing) as well as informal practices for use in daily life (e.g., soothing touch, self-compassionate letter writing). A detailed clinical case illustrates the journey of a client through the 8 weeks of MSC training, describing the key features of each session and the client's response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Paranoia may build on negative beliefs held both about the self and others. Compassionate imagery may be one way of reducing such negative beliefs, and hence paranoia. Two studies tested this idea, one targeting compassion for the self and one targeting compassion for others. Two-hundred individuals from the general population scoring highly for paranoia were recruited. The studies used a randomised controlled experimental design, with embedded tests for mediation. Study one targeted self-compassion via creation of a compassionate coach (CC) image. Study two targeted compassion for others via loving kindness meditation (LKM). Individuals repeatedly entered neutral virtual reality social environments. Changes in compassion and paranoia were assessed. Compared to controls, the CC group increased in self-compassion (group difference = 2.12, C.I. = 1.57;2.67, p = <0.0001, d = 1.4) and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.73, C.I. = −2.48; −0.98, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in self-compassion explained 57% of change in paranoia. Compared to controls, the LKM group increased their compassion for others (group difference = 3.26, C.I. = 2.72;3.80, p = <0.0001, d = 1.7), and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.70, C.I. = −2.50; −0.89, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in compassion for others explained 67% of change in paranoia. Targeting negative beliefs about the self and others using compassionate imagery causes reductions in paranoia. Tests in clinical populations are indicated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The authors, both anthropologists who study alternative states of consciousness (ASC), explore the psychodynamics of mystical experience (ME). An affect that is a key factor for and integral to the phenomenology of ME is what they term "mystical love." In many respects, ME refers to ASC that is diametrically opposite to everyday ego‐centered, materialist consciousness. In this article we examine several questions, including: (1) Why do humans experience ME, (2) why does there seems to be a need to alter consciousness away from ordinary waking states, (3) what is the relationship between mystical love and other affective states such as anger, greed, and anxiety, and (3) what are the necessary conditions for ME‐type, transpersonal experiences? We demonstrate that ritual practices are recurrently used across cultures to incubate and evoke intense feelings of non‐romantic love, empathy, and compassion. Some of these practices include ritual drivers such as ingesting psychotropic substances (entheogens and empathogens), daily activities that devalue ego centeredness and promote love, empathy and selfless service, meditation upon loving kindness, and compassion. All of these practices are preparations for entering ME, the results of which are interpreted within people's cycle of meaning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Depression is a widespread disorder with severe impacts for individuals and society, especially in its chronic form. Current treatment approaches for persistent depression have focused primarily on reducing negative affect and have paid little attention to promoting positive affect. Previous studies have shown that metta meditation increases positive affect in chronically depressed patients. Results from previous trials provide evidence for the efficacy of a stand-alone metta meditation group treatment in combination with mindfulness-based approaches. Further research is needed to better understand the implementation of meditation practice into everyday life. Therefore, mindfulness and metta meditation in a group setting are combined with individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into a new, low-intensity, cost-effective treatment ("MeCBT") for chronic depression.<bold>Methods/design: </bold>In this single-center, randomized, observer-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial we will test the efficacy of MeCBT in reducing depression compared to a wait-list control condition. Forty-eight participants in a balanced design will be allocated randomly to a treatment group or a wait-list control group. Metta-based group meditation will be offered in eight weekly sessions and one additional half-day retreat. Subsequent individual CBT will be conducted in eight fortnightly sessions. Outcome measures will be assessed at four time points: before intervention (T0); after group meditation (T1); after individual CBT (T2); and, in the treated group only, at 6-month follow-up (T3). Changes in depressive symptoms (clinician rating), assessed with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-C) are the primary outcome. We expect a significant decline of depressive symptoms at T2 compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary outcome measures include self-rated depression, mindfulness, benevolence, rumination, emotion regulation, social connectedness, social functioning, as well as behavioral and cognitive avoidance. We will explore changes at T1 and T2 in all these secondary outcome variables.<bold>Discussion: </bold>To our knowledge this is the first study to combine a group program focusing on Metta meditation with state-of-the art individual CBT specifically tailored to chronic depression. Implications for further refinement and examination of the treatment program are discussed.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>ISRCTN, ISRCTN97264476. Registered 29 March 2018 (applied on 14 December 2017)-retrospectively registered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the last decade a number of researchers have proposed that therapeutic presence can be fostered through training in mindfulness practices. Most counseling training programs focus on teaching students a set of skills, although the common or contextual factors movement contends that the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the personal characteristics of the therapist are the key determinants of positive therapy outcomes. For the past 10 years we have been teaching mindfulness practices to counseling students in a CACREP-accredited program. Our research suggests that training in practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga, qigong, and body-awareness can help counselors to realize and embody the personal characteristics that foster therapeutic presence. This article provides a detailed description of our mindfulness-based course, proposes recommendations for counseling coursework in mindfulness, and discusses the impact of the course on the ability to cultivate therapeutic presence.

AB  - Objectives: This pilot study explores the impact of Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) in veterans. Self-compassion, the capacity to hold one’s suffering with kindness and a wish to alleviate it, is associated with improvements in well-being. Veterans have more medical conditions than non-veterans and higher prevalence rates of severe pain. Acceptability of the intervention with veterans is assessed along with the impact of MSC on the physical, mental, and social health of the participants. Methods: A racially diverse, predominantly male group of veterans (n = 80) were assessed pre- and post-MSC group with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to evaluate physical, mental, and social health. Measures of self-compassion, happiness, self-report medication usage, and a global assessment of improvement measure were also included. Qualitative responses to the MSC program were also solicited and reviewed. Results: Engagement with MSC was high (74% completion rate) and 96% of treatment completers rated their participation in the intervention as positive. Completers demonstrated small to medium effect size increases in self-compassion, happiness, and social role satisfaction, 95% CIs (− 6.13, −2.65), (−2.62, −1.06), and (−4.28, −1.05), and decreases in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain interference, 95% CIs (0.44, 4.13), (0.57, 4.84), (0.43, 3.71), and (0.13, 2.70). In exploratory analyses related to pain, veterans taking pain medication reported a significant decrease in use (χ²(2, N = 47) = 24.30, p < .001). Conclusions: These results are suggestive of the positive effects of the MSC intervention to veterans, but await a randomized controlled trial to establish its effectiveness in this population.

AB  - We explore the role of meditative practice in cultivating experiences of compassion, empathy, and altruism and address an apparent paradox: Meditation often is associated with solitary retreat, if not preoccupation with one's own concerns. How, then, does such a practice promote compassion for others? We propose a two-stage model. The first stage involves disengagement from usual preoccupation with self-reinforcing, self-defeating, or self-indulgent behaviors and reactions; the second involves a focused engagement with a universal human capacity for altruistic experience, love, and compassion. Reference is made to the limited research literature and to clinical applications of loving kindness (metta) meditation in cultivating these processes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Attention Training Technique (ATT) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) are two promising psychological interventions. ATT is a 12-min auditory exercise designed to strengthen attentional control and promote external focus of attention, while MSC uses guided meditation and exercises designed to promote self-compassion. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), a three-session intervention trial was conducted in which university students were randomly assigned to either an ATT-group (n = 40) or a MSC-group (n = 41). The students were not assessed with diagnostic interviews but had self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress. Participants listened to audiotapes of ATT or MSC before discussing in groups how to apply these principles for their everyday struggles. Participants also listened to audiotapes of ATT and MSC as homework between sessions. Participants in both groups showed significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression accompanied by significant increases in mindfulness, self-compassion, and attention flexibility post-intervention. These results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Improvement in attention flexibility was the only significant unique predictor of treatment response. The study supports the use of both ATT and MSC for students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, it suggests that symptom improvement is related to changes in attention flexibility across both theoretical frameworks. Future studies should focus on how to strengthen the ability for attention flexibility to optimize treatment for emotional disorder. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Accumulating evidence from the last two decades suggests self-compassion is central to psychological well-being and reduced psychopathology symptoms. Loving-kindness meditations (LKMs), a mindfulness practice that involves sending feelings of kindness to oneself, loved ones, and all beings, may increase feelings of self-compassion. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of LKMs on self-compassion in adults. Methods: Peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertations written in English with adult samples, quantitative analysis of a LKM, and measured self-compassion using the Self-Compassion Scale were included in the meta-analysis. Seven articles met inclusion criteria following a systematic search. Results: We found a moderate overall effect of LKMs on self-compassion (g = 0.44, p < 0.0001), indicating LKMs are effective at increasing self-compassion in adults. Conclusions: Self-compassion can be increased in adults using LKMs. Given the role of self-compassion in well-being, future research should test increasing self-compassion as a mechanism of the effect of LKMs on psychological health.

AB  - Background: Although evidence‐based psychological treatments for chronic pain (CP) have been demonstrated to be effective for a variety of outcomes, modest effects observed in recent reviews indicate scope for improvement. Self‐compassion promotes a proactive attitude towards self‐care and actively seeking relief from suffering. Consequently, more compassionate people experience better physical, psychological and interpersonal well‐being. Methods: We conducted a single‐blind, randomized, controlled trial to examine the effects of a Mindful Self‐Compassion program (MSC) on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with CP. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention arms: MSC or cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT). The protocols of both intervention arms were standardized and consisted of a 150‐min session once a week during 8 weeks formatted to groups of no more than 20 participants. The primary outcome was self‐compassion, measured with the Self‐Compassion Scale (SCS). The secondary outcomes were other pain‐related scores, quality‐of‐life measures, and anxiety and depression scores. Results: In all, 62 and 61 patients were assigned to the MSC and CBT groups, respectively. The MSC intervention was more effective than CBT for self‐compassion (average treatment effect [ATE] = 0.126, p < 0.05). The secondary outcomes, pain acceptance (ATE = 5.214, p < 0.01), pain interference (ATE = −0.393, p < 0.05), catastrophizing (ATE = −2.139, p < 0.10) and anxiety (ATE = −0.902, p < 0.05), were also favoured in the experimental arm (MSC). No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions: Mindful Self‐Compassion is an appropriate therapeutic approach for CP patients and may result in greater benefits on self‐compassion and emotional well‐being than CBT. Significance: This randomized controlled trial compares the novel intervention (MSC program) with the gold standard psychological intervention for CP (CBT). MSC improves the levels of self‐compassion, a therapeutic target that is receiving attention since the last two decades, and it also improves anxiety symptoms, pain interference and pain acceptance more than what CBT does. These results provide empirical support to guide clinical work towards the promotion of self‐compassion in psychotherapeutic interventions for people with CP.

AB  - The effect of meditation on brain activity has been the topic of many studies in healthy subjects and in patients suffering from chronic diseases. These effects are either explored during meditation practice (state effects) or as a longer-term result of meditation training during the resting-state (trait). The topic of this article is to first review these findings by focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) changes in healthy subjects with or without experience in meditation. Modifications in EEG baseline rhythms, functional connectivity and advanced nonlinear parameters are discussed in regard to feasibility in clinical applications. Secondly, we provide a state-of-the-art of studies that proposed meditative practices as a complementary therapy in patients with epilepsy, in whom anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent. In these studies, the effects of standardized meditation programs including elements of traditional meditation practices such as mindfulness, loving-kindness and compassion are explored both at the level of psychological functioning and on the occurrence of seizures. Lastly, preliminary results are given regarding our ongoing study, the aim of which is to quantify the effects of a mindfulness self-compassion (MSC) practice on interictal and ictal epileptic activity. Feasibility, difficulties, and prospects of this study are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: According to the core Buddhist psychology models of the 'two arrows of pain' and 'co-dependent origination,' pain is the resultant of bodily and mental factors, which can be regulated by meditation states and traits. Here we investigated how pain and the related aversion and identification (self-involvement) experiences are modulated by focused attention meditation (FAM), open monitoring meditation (OMM), and loving kindness meditation (LKM), as well as by meditation expertise. Methods: Theravada Buddhist long-term meditators were matched with a group of short-term meditators. Nociceptive electrical stimulation was administered during FAM, OMM, and LKM, and in a non-meditative rest condition. Experience reports of pain, aversion, and identification were collected in each trial. Results: Pain thresholds were higher in long-term meditators than in short-term meditators. In the short-term meditators, as compared to rest, pain was reduced in FAM and OMM, and aversion and identification in all meditation conditions. In the long-term meditators, pain was reduced only in LKM. Identification was reduced in the three forms of meditation, while aversion was not affected by meditation. Further analyses with a particular focus on long-term meditators showed that pain was predicted to increase with meditation expertise, aversion, and identification. Granger causality analysis revealed that aversion and pain, as well as aversion and identification, causally influenced each other; identification causally influenced pain. This pattern of results about the relationships between pain, aversion, and identification was largely overlapping in the group of short-term meditators. Conclusions: The findings reveal mechanisms of pain in interaction with aversive and identification mental states, as well as their modulation by meditation states and traits. They also suggest that pain feeling is the resultant of coupling of sensory and mental factors, thus highlighting the relevance of the second arrow of pain and providing a clarification of the epistemological gap between sensory causation and mental state causation of pain, in terms of a co-production mechanism with multiple stages. In particular, the evidence about the causal influences of identification on pain highlights a self-related factor of relevance in pain experiences that can be modulated by mindfulness. The study also inspires new testable neuroscientific hypotheses, and sheds new light on core Buddhist psychology models, based on evidence from a controlled experimental setting and experience dimension reports by long-term meditators with enhanced mindfulness skills.

AB  - Objectives Reducing and eliminating the use of Restrictive Practices (RPs) is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). This systematic review examines the effectiveness of organisation-wide interventions in reducing behaviours of concern (BoC) and the use of RPs in people with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Methods 19 electronic databases were searched up to February 2021 for literature, with no language restrictions applied. This systematic review of interventions included any publication aimed at reducing the use of RPs and/or BoC in organisations providing services to people with any NDD. Results A total of 15 studies were included in the review. Seven were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-RCTs. Most studies focussed on workplace education and training. There was evidence that staff training in Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) and mindfulness-based PBS (MBPBS) reduced aggression, the use of chemical and physical restraints, and peer and staff injuries (MBPBS) in the medium term. A multi-component intervention also showed evidence of a reduction in behaviours of concern in the medium and long term. Conclusions A number of studies showed that organisation-wide PBS training, particularly MBPBS training, can reduce BoC and the use of RPs. One multi-component study also substantially reduced BoC. Organisational strategies such as these can improve the rights of people with disability by reducing the use of RPs. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited as all comparisons were single studies which had potential biases. We are also not able to say whether these findings can be generalised to children, and adults with other neurodevelopmental disabilities, as all but one study focused on adults with intellectual disabilities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many disruptions to the otherwise routine dimensions of our lives, and consequently has raised our individual and collective awareness of our mortality, and of the contingency, fragility, and uncertainty of life, among many other considerations the pandemic has foisted upon us. Anyone doing philosophical counseling work at this time is likely to be addressing these concerns. In this article, I explore some of the ways these issues have impacted me, and, more importantly, how they may figure in philosophical counseling work. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background Evidence suggests that facilitating empathy could improve individuals' well-being. Loving-kindness meditation ( LKM) could be a facilitator, and online delivery a cost-effective format. Methods We conducted an internet-based randomised controlled trial recruiting 809 adults to test whether an LKM course improves well-being through evoking pleasant emotions, psychological resources, and altruism compared to a light physical exercise course ( LE). Participants in both arms followed video-based instructions, completed post-intervention questionnaires, and used online diaries and forums. To measure altruism £10/$10 were offered to participants with a choice of donating all/half to charity. Thematic analysis was applied to diary/forum entries. Results Both courses increased well-being without significant differences. LKM participants were less anxious than LE participants (ß = −0.22, 95% confidence interval ( CI) [−0.43, −0.02], p = .03), and more likely to donate £5/$5 (Relative Risk = 3.57, 95% CI [0.82, 15.50], p = .09). Attrition was high (82%). Participants engaged in diary/forum usage. LKM was an emotionally intense experience, generating deep reflections and increased connectedness but difficult for some to process. LE led to gentle increases in relaxation, generating a sense of achievement. Conclusions Future research needs to confirm findings and devise ways of delivering online LKM effectively to diverse populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental condition characterized by a range of cognitive and behavioral vulnerabilities, including chronic shame and deficits in social problem solving (SPS) abilities. Little research however, has examined strategies that may alleviate shame and SPS deficits among individuals with BPD traits. Using a laboratory experimental approach, the present study compared the effects of a brief mindfulness versus loving-kindness meditation (LKM) induction on shame and SPS abilities in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. Eighty-eight participants underwent a shame induction procedure involving recall of a negative autobiographical memory. They were then randomly assigned to 10 min of mindful breathing or LKM, or a no-instruction condition. Shame and SPS abilities were assessed via visual analogue scales and the Means-Ends Problem Solving task respectively. Results indicated that there were significant decreases in shame from pre-to post-regulation in the mindfulness group versus the LKM and no-instruction groups. Groups did not differ on changes in SPS abilities from pre-to post-regulation. Overall, the findings support the efficacy of mindfulness as a strategy to regulate shame among individuals with BPD traits, and raises questions with regard to the utility of LKM in modulating shame in the context of high emotional arousal.

AB  - An experiment involving 115 undergraduate students (74.8% females; mean age=20.5 years, SD=4.3) was conducted to explore effects of meditation on social connectedness, nature connectedness, and affect. Participants listened to one of three brief guided meditation Mp3 recordings via the internet, which involved mindfulness meditation (MM), loving-kindness meditation (LKM), or progressive muscle relaxation (active control group). Participants in the MM and LKM groups reported greater social and nature connectedness at post-test than those in the control group. There were no significant differences in connectedness between the MM and LKM groups, suggesting they are both effective for enhancing connectedness. There were no significant changes in negative or positive affect at post-test due to the interventions. Recommendations for future research are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Student mental health and well-being are increasing concerns in higher education. This exploratory study examined students' learning in a mindfulness programme incorporated into an undergraduate class. Six brief mindfulness-based practices were introduced: mindfulness meditation, walking meditation, body scan, mindful eating, loving-kindness and Tonglen meditation. Fourteen students were interviewed after completion of the course to explore their conceptions and use of mindfulness and other self-care practices. Results of thematic analyses suggest that there were variations in students' adoption of mindfulness-based practices and students' preferred mindfulness techniques. Most participants reported that mindfulness instruction and practice were beneficial but this was not universal; some students reported that mindfulness was 'not for them'. Findings suggest that mindfulness fostered self-reflection, self-awareness and relaxation for many students and incorporating mindfulness at the beginning of class improved the overall quality of discussion and facilitated students' learning. Findings further suggest that students incorporated mindfulness into existing self-care practices that included a variety of other preferred techniques to enhance self-reflection, self-awareness and relaxation. Overall, our findings suggest that students should be helped, through explicit instruction, to develop a 'toolbox' of self-care approaches that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, mindfulness techniques.

AB  - In patients with diabetes, psychological well-being constructs (e.g., optimism, positive affect) have been associated with superior medical outcomes, including better glucose control and lower mortality rates. Well-being interventions may be well-suited to individuals with diabetes, as they are simple to deliver, broadly applicable across a range of psychological distress, and may help increase self-efficacy and motivation for diabetes self-care. This systematic review, completed using PRISMA guidelines, examined peer-reviewed studies indexed in PubMed, PsycINFO, and/or Scopus between database inception and October 2017 that investigated the effects of well-being interventions (e.g., positive psychology interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, resilience-based interventions) on psychological and physical health outcomes in individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The search yielded 34 articles (N = 1635 participants), with substantial variability in intervention type, measures used, and outcomes studied; the majority found the intervention to provide benefit. Overall, results indicate that a range of well-being interventions appear to have promise in improving health outcomes in this population, but the literature does not yet provide definitive data about which specific interventions are most effective. The variability in interventions and outcomes points to a need for further rigorous, controlled, and well-powered studies of specific interventions, with well-accepted, clinically relevant outcome measures.

AB  - Background: Ontological addiction theory (OAT) is a novel metaphysical model of psychopathology and posits that human beings are prone to forming implausible beliefs concerning the way they think they exist, and that these beliefs can become addictive leading to functional impairments and mental illness. The theoretical underpinnings of OAT derive from the Buddhist philosophical perspective that all phenomena, including the self, do not manifest inherently or independently. Aims and methods: This paper outlines the theoretical foundations of OAT along with indicative supportive empirical evidence from studies evaluating meditation awareness training as well as studies investigating non-attachment, emptiness, compassion, and loving-kindness. Results: OAT provides a novel perspective on addiction, the factors that underlie mental illness, and how beliefs concerning selfhood are shaped and reified. Conclusion: In addition to continuing to test the underlying assumptions of OAT, future empirical research needs to determine how ontological addiction fits with extant theories of self, reality, and suffering, as well with more established models of addiction.

AB  - Objectives It is debatable whether loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) effectively reduces anxiety, and previous studies have reported inconsistent findings. This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of LKCM on anxiety. Method Studies that took LKCM as the main body and measured anxiety as an outcome were included. There were no exclusion criteria for sample characteristics or control groups. Results Among 327 empirical studies published up to March 2022 on LKCM, 59 measured anxiety as an outcome. Metaanalyses showed that LKCM interventions are effective in reducing anxiety (d = -0.28, k = 19, n = 1284 for randomized controlled trials; d = -0.48, k = 26, n = 1177 for nonrandomized trials; d = -0.58, k = 6, n = 503 for laboratory experiments). The heterogeneity was high between studies. Subgroup analyses for randomized controlled trials found that studies combining loving-kindness meditation and mindfulness meditation outperformed studies adopting loving-kindness meditation alone. Moreover, studies with waitlist controls had greater effect sizes than studies with active controls. The type of anxiety, participant characteristics, protocol, or length of intervention had no statistically significant moderating effects. Individual studies supported mindfulness and self-compassion as important mechanisms, but the amount of meditation practice made a limited contribution. Conclusions LKCM interventions can be effective in reducing anxiety. The incremental value of combining mindfulness meditation with loving-kindness meditation is encouraging. More research is needed, especially on specific populations suffering from anxiety disorders. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although many positive psychology interventions like mindfulness-based treatments (MBTs) for youth have been used with a wide array of risk exposed populations (children living in poverty, victims of violence, displaced persons, children with disabilities, etc.), the efficacy of MBTs with regard to the level and domain of risk exposure has been largely overlooked. This oversight contributes to a perception of positive psychology as being decontextualized. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to better understand how a young person’s level and domain of risk exposure influences the efficacy of MBTs. Published studies were included if participants were children or adolescents, were RCTs or cluster RCTs, and focused on the effect of an MBT or an MBT component. Specifically, 58 studies were qualitatively analyzed and 42 were quantitatively analyzed. The qualitative analysis evidenced a lack of objectivity in the assessment of risk exposure, with many papers providing very little or no detail on participants’ level or domain of risk exposure (whether threats to psychological wellbeing originate with the individual’s biology or cognitions, or the social, built or natural environment). Our quantitative analysis showed that MBTs significantly improved main outcomes relative to the control conditions, with a small-to-moderate effect size. Where it was possible to identify the level of risk exposure, we found that MBTs positively moderated treatment response, with better response among those participants with a higher level of risk. We conclude that future Positive Psychology research will need to better account for risk exposure if the discipline is to improve our understanding of which populations benefit most from interventions that promote mindfulness.

AB  - Our goal was to assess the effects of long-term mental training in socio-affective skills on structural brain networks. We studied a group of long-term meditation practitioners (LTMs) who have focused on cultivating socio-affective skills using loving-kindness and compassion meditation for an average of 40k h, comparing these to meditation-naïve controls. To maximize homogeneity of prior practice, LTMs were included only if they had undergone extensive full-time meditation retreats in the same center. MRI-based cortical thickness analysis revealed increased thickness in the LTM cohort relative to meditation-native controls in fronto-insular cortices. To identify functional networks relevant for the generation of socio-affective states, structural imaging analysis were complemented by fMRI analysis in LTMs, showing amplitude increases during a loving-kindness meditation session relative to non-meditative rest in multiple prefrontal and insular regions bilaterally. Importantly, functional findings partially overlapped with regions of cortical thickness increases in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, suggesting that these regions may play a central role in the generation of emotional states relevant for the meditative practice. Our multi-modal MRI approach revealed structural changes in LTMs who have cultivated loving-kindness and compassion for a significant period of their life in functional networks activated by these practices. These preliminary cross-sectional findings motivate future longitudinal work studying brain plasticity following the regular practice of skills aiming at enhancing human altruism and prosocial motivation.

AB  - To better understand the cultivation of positive intra- and interpersonal emotions, we examined an argument that some effects of contemplative training result from language processing. We presented participants with loving-kindness language used in kindness-meditation training studies and asked them to rate imagined pain. If loving-kindness language processing is responsible for some effects recently reported we expected this language could affect intra- and interpersonal sensitivity. Loving-kindness-language participants rated imagined other-pain significantly higher and imagined self-pain significantly lower than closely matched control participants. As a result of this interaction, the loving-kindness-language group showed no significant difference between self-pain and other-pain, whereas controls rated self-pain significantly higher than other-pain. These results suggest that exposure to loving-kindness-language in Loving-Kindness Meditation leads to changes in sensitivity to own and vicarious distress without explicit training. These findings underscore that meditation-like effects may be easily induced. Further research is needed to determine duration and degree of effect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Meditation, as taught by most schools of practice, consists of a set of heterogeneous techniques. We wanted to assess if EEG profiles varied across different meditation techniques, proficiency levels and experience of the practitioners. We examined EEG dynamics in Vipassana meditators (Novice, Senior meditators and Teachers) while they engaged in their traditional meditation practice (concentration, mindfulness and loving kindness in a structured manner) as taught by S.N. Goenka. Seniors and Teachers (vs Novices) showed trait increases in delta (1–4 Hz), theta-alpha (6–10 Hz) and low-gamma power (30–40 Hz) at baseline rest; state-trait increases in low-alpha (8–10 Hz) and low-gamma power during concentrative and mindfulness meditation; and theta-alpha and low-gamma power during loving-kindness meditation. Permutation entropy and Higuchi fractal dimension measures further dissociated high proficiency from duration of experience as only Teachers showed consistent increase in network complexity from baseline rest and state transitions between the different meditation states.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in effects of meditation, systematic in-depth research on how it qualitatively feels to engage in different kinds of contemplative practices is still missing. To fill this gap, we explore the validity of Micro-phenomenological Interviews (MpI) to assess experiences during breathing meditation (BM), observing-thought meditation (OTM), and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). We performed psycholinguistic analyses, quantitative ratings and qualitative explorations of 104 MpI (N = 57). All results reveal differential affective, bodily and sensorial fingerprints: BM-transcripts contain the most body-related vocabulary, specifically sensations in nose and abdomen. OTM-transcripts contain the most cognition-related vocabulary. OTM is experienced in head and face. LKM-transcripts contain the most vocabulary related to socio-affective processes. LKM is associated to love, sensations around the heart, and warmth. The LKM-outcomes were replicated with another independent set of MpI. These findings verify the merit of MpI as a scientific tool to gain reliable first-person data beyond questionnaires or rating scales. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that the effects of meditation practice on affective processing and resilience have the potential to induce neuroplastic changes within the amygdala. Notably, literature speculates that meditation training may reduce amygdala activity during negative affective processing. Nonetheless, studies have thus far not verified this speculation. In this longitudinal study, participants (<italic>N</italic> = 21, 9 men) were trained in awareness-based compassion meditation (ABCM) or matched relaxation training. The effects of meditation training on amygdala activity were examined during passive viewing of affective and neutral stimuli in a non-meditative state. We found that the ABCM group exhibited significantly reduced anxiety and right amygdala activity during negative emotion processing than the relaxation group. Furthermore, ABCM participants who performed more compassion practice had stronger right amygdala activity reduction during negative emotion processing. The lower right amygdala activity after ABCM training may be associated with a general reduction in reactivity and distress. As all participants performed the emotion processing task in a non-meditative state, it appears likely that the changes in right amygdala activity are carried over from the meditation practice into the non-meditative state. These findings suggest that the distress-reducing effects of meditation practice on affective processing may transfer to ordinary states, which have important implications on stress management.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the effects of loving-kindness meditation on positive emotions, intragroup interactions, and complex understanding of others. A total of 50 freshmen not receiving any training in meditation intervention were randomly divided into the meditation group (25 subjects) and the control group (25 subjects). The meditation group was implemented with group meditation intervention for 4 weeks, three times a week, about 30 minutes each time. The results revealed that the effect sizes in interpersonal interaction and complex understanding of others in the meditation group were both above 0.8, indicating strong effects. It was concluded that loving-kindness meditation can effectively improve positive emotions, interpersonal interactions, and complex understanding of others in college students.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>End-of-life (EoL) care professionals are prone to burnout given the intense emotional nature of their work. Previous research supports the efficacy of art therapy in reducing work-related stress and enhancing emotional health among professional EoL caregivers. Integrating mindfulness meditation with art therapy and reflective awareness complementing emotional expression has immense potential for self-care and collegial support. Mindful-compassion art therapy (MCAT) is a novel, empirically informed, and highly structured intervention that aims to reduce work-related stress, cultivate resilience, and promote wellness. This study aims to assess the potential effectiveness of MCAT for supporting EoL care professionals in Singapore.<bold>Methods: </bold>This is an open-label waitlist randomized controlled trial. Sixty EoL care professionals, including doctors, nurses, social workers, and personal care workers, are randomly allocated to one of two groups: (i) an intervention group that receives MCAT immediately and (ii) a waitlist-control group that receives MCAT after the intervention group completes treatment. Face-to-face self-administered outcome assessments are collected at three different time points-baseline (T1) for both groups, post-intervention (T2), and 6-week follow-up (T3) for intervention group-as well as pre-intervention (T2) and post-intervention (T3) for the waitlist-control group. The primary outcome measure is burnout, and secondary measures include emotional regulation, resilience, compassion, quality of life, and death attitudes. Between- and within-participant comparisons of outcomes are conducted, and the appropriate effect size estimates are reported. An acceptability and feasibility study is to be conducted by using a triangulation of qualitative data with framework analysis.<bold>Discussion: </bold>The outcomes of this study will contribute to advancements in both theories and practices for supporting professional EoL caregivers around the world. It will also inform policy makers about the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of delivering a multimodal psycho-socio-spiritual intervention within a community institutional setting. The study has received ethical approval from the institutional review board of Nanyang Technological University.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03440606 .

AB  - Due to its potential to concurrently improve work-related wellbeing (WRW) and job performance, occupational stakeholders are becoming increasingly interested in the applications of meditation. The present study conducted the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of meditation on outcomes relating to both WRW and job performance. Office-based middle-hierarchy managers ( n = 152) received an eight-week meditation intervention (Meditation Awareness Training; MAT) or an active control intervention. MAT participants demonstrated significant and sustainable improvements (with strong effect sizes) over control-group participants in levels of work-related stress, job satisfaction, psychological distress, and employer-rated job performance. There are a number of novel implications: (i) meditation can effectuate a perceptual shift in how employees experience their work and psychological environment and may thus constitute a cost-effective WRW intervention, (ii) meditation-based (i.e., present-moment-focussed) working styles may be more effective than goal-based (i.e., future-orientated) working styles, and (iii) meditation may reduce the separation made by employees between their own interests and those of the organizations they work for.

AB  - Conventional treatments for mood disorders primarily focus on reducing negative affect, but little on enhancing positive affect. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a traditional meditation practice directly oriented toward enhancing unconditional and positive emotional states of kindness towards oneself and others. We report here two independent and uncontrolled studies carried out at different centers, one in Boston, USA (n = 10), and one in Frankfurt, Germany (n = 8), to examine the potential therapeutic utility of a brief LKM group intervention for symptoms of dysthymia and depression. Results at both centers suggest that LKM was associated with large-sized effects on self-reported symptoms of depression (d = 3.33 and 1.90), negative affect (d = 1.98 and 0.92), and positive affect (d = 1.63 and 0.94). Large effects were also found for clinician-reported changes in depression, rumination and specific positive emotions, and moderate effects for changes in adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The qualitative data analyses provide additional support for the potential clinical utility of the intervention. This proof-of-concept evaluation of LKM as a clinical strategy warrants further investigation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to examine the effects of Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) training on the nature of caregiver and client reciprocal interactions at a moment-by-moment level using behavior analytic methodology. Specifically, we compared the behavior of caregivers and clients before and after MBPBS training for the caregivers in terms of caregiver-client engagement, percent of learning and leisure interactions during caregiver-client engagement, and percent of the clients’ challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors during learning and leisure interactions. In addition, we examined the effects of specific conditionality of attentional responses of the caregivers to the clients’ challenging or socially acceptable behavior in terms of frequency, latency, duration, and quality.MethodCaregiver and client engagements were videotaped before and after MBPBS training for the caregivers. The percent of caregiver-client engagement was analyzed using partial-interval recording for overall engagement and the clients’ challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors during learning and leisure interactions. The effects of the caregivers’ attentional responses to the clients’ challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors were analyzed using whole-interval recording.ResultsTraining caregivers in MBPBS significantly increased caregiver-client engagement during learning and leisure activities, which resulted in the clients exhibiting fewer challenging behaviors and more socially appropriate behaviors. Furthermore, an analysis of the effects of different types of caregiver attention showed differential effects on the clients’ challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors.ConclusionsThe results indicated that behavior analytic methods can be used as an objective and reliable way of capturing the nature of changes in predefined behaviors of both caregivers and clients at a moment-by-moment level following training of the caregivers in a mindfulness-based program. Using such an analytic method may provide an effective way of objectively measuring some experiential processes involved in mindfulness training.

AB  - Due to its potential to improve work-related stress and job performance, there is growing interest into the applications of mindfulness in the workplace setting. To date, mindfulness research within occupational psychology has mostly involved First Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (FG-MBIs). However, a growing number of researchers, clinicians, and Buddhist teachers/scholars have suggested that FG-MBIs may only partially embody the full potency of mindfulness when compared with its utilisation in traditional Buddhist practice settings. Consequently, recent years have witnessed the early stage evaluation of a number of Second Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (SG-MBIs). Although still secular, SG-MBIs are overtly spiritual in aspect and teach mindfulness within a practice infrastructure that integrates what would traditionally be deemed as prerequisites for effective spiritual and meditative development. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first qualitative investigation to analyse the experiences of employed participants receiving training in a SG-MBI. Ten participants were randomly selected from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial assessing the effects of meditation awareness training (MAT) on work-related wellbeing and job performance. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse participant experiences of MAT, and six themes emerged from the data-set: (1) changing attitudes towards work, (2) improved job performance, (3) letting go of self, (4) phenomena feed-back effect, (5) wellbeing at work and (6) taking responsibility for one’s spiritual growth. Findings have important implications for the development of authentic mindfulness training programs and suggest that, compared with FG-MBIs, the SG-MBI approach may be tapping into different metacognitive resources.

AB  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LKCM) are considered a promising practice for increasing long-term well-being. While previous studies have mainly focused on meditation practice quantity, the current study provides an initial exploration of the quality of meditation during multiweek LKCM training. Data were collected through offline (Study 1; N = 41) and online (Study 2; N = 243) LKCM interventions. Quality of meditation was measured using two kinds of difficulties experienced during LKCM each week/unit (i.e., difficulty in concentration and difficulty in generating prosocial attitudes). Subjective well-being (SWB) was assessed by life satisfaction before and after training as well as positive and negative emotions each week/unit. Two studies consistently suggested that meditation quality was significantly associated with changes in SWB. Study 1 even showed that quality had a stronger association with SWB than did meditation quantity. Moreover, both short-term (measured each week/unit) and long-term (measured across the entire training period) associations between the quality of meditation and SWB were significant. Focusing on meditation quality, our findings provide theoretical and methodological pathways for understanding the contribution of meditation practice to LKCM training, which is helpful for guiding future research and best practices.

AB  - Our understanding of the emotions elicited by loving‐kindness meditation (LKM) at early stages of practice is limited, despite the influence that these emotions may have on later engagement. Past work suggests that LKM may elicit emotional ambivalence at early stages of the practice, but it is still unclear whether the content of LKM activates this ambivalence and who is more likely to experience it. Given the specific content of LKM, we defend that this meditation is likely to elicit empathetic emotions, both positive (compassion and gratitude) and negative (guilt), to a greater extent than an active control. Guilt is likely to be elicited by memories of incidents where naïve meditators were not able to experience compassion and/or by the difficulties in sending compassionate love to disliked others during the meditation. Furthermore, individuals with greater self‐discrepancy and lower self‐esteem are more likely to experience guilt. These hypotheses were tested in two experimental studies with community and student samples (n = 55 and n = 33, respectively) and using a brief intervention. The results support the hypotheses. These findings have implications for instructors of LKM, especially when organizing meditation practices with naïve meditators who should be aware of the potential negative emotions elicited by this meditation.

AB  - In this pilot study, N = 11 patients suffering from chronic depression were treated in a 12-week group program consisting of basic mindfulness exercises from Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and compassion exercises from Compassion Focused Therapy and Loving Kindness Meditation. In a 3-month waiting period prior to treatment, depression symptoms both in self-report and clinician rating did not change significantly. After treatment, depression severity was significantly reduced. After a 3-month follow-up, the symptoms further improved, with almost large effect sizes being observed in primary outcome measures. Changes in emotion regulation styles reflected by a significant increase in acceptance and significant decrease in suppression of emotions were observed at follow-up. Rumination about oneself was also significantly reduced at follow-up. Compassionate love and mindfulness were increased at follow-up, no effects were found on the Self-Compassion Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Given further confirming studies for this approach, it might improve treatment options for patients suffering from chronic depression. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Negative interpersonal attitudes can affect people’s well-being, interpersonal relationships, and cooperation. Overcoming negative interpersonal attitudes is a key subject in loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LCMs). However, the results and study design of previous research on negative interpersonal attitudes have been inconsistent. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the effects of LCMs and explore moderators through meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Core Collection, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and PsycINFO databases up to April 2, 2021. Of the 281 identified empirical studies on LCMs, 25 measured negative interpersonal attitudes, and 21 were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the effects of LCMs on negative interpersonal attitudes in daily life were significant both for randomized controlled trials (g = -.203) and uncontrolled trials (g = -.539). The instant effects after meditation were also significant in randomized controlled experiments (g = -.187). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and nonsignificant subgroup analysis showed that the results were robust except for randomized controlled experiments. Although no significant moderators were identified, moderator analysis suggested that reducing bias and sending wishes to difficult targets were especially effective, and LCM subtypes might impact the results. Individual studies found that the contribution of meditation practice during interventions was weak. In sum, LCMs have the potential to reduce negative interpersonal attitudes, especially in multiweek interventions. Future studies should further explore the underlying mechanisms and consider the implications of study design features, such as the induction of negative interpersonal attitudes and the targets of LCMs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is a paucity of interventional approaches that are sensitive to the complex needs of individuals with co-occurring schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Utilizing a single-participant design, this study conducted the first clinical evaluation of a novel and integrated non-pharmacological treatment for a participant with dual-diagnosis schizophrenia and pathological gambling. The participant underwent a 20-week treatment course comprising: (i) an initial phase of second-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and (ii) a subsequent phase employing a meditation-based recovery model (involving the administering of an intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training). The primary outcome was diagnostic change (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) for schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Secondary outcomes were: (i) psychiatric symptom severity, (ii) pathological gambling symptom severity, (iii) psychosocial functioning, and (iv) dispositional mindfulness. Findings demonstrated that the participant was successfully treated for both schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Significant improvements were also observed across all other outcome variables and positive outcomes were maintained at 3-month follow-up. An initial phase of CBT to improve social coping skills and environmental mastery, followed by a phase of meditation-based therapy to increase perceptual distance from mental urges and intrusive thoughts, may be a diagnostically-syntonic treatment for co-occurring schizophrenia and pathological gambling.

AB  - Loving kindness is a form of meditation involving directed well-wishing, typically supported by the silent repetition of phrases such as 'may all beings be happy,' to foster a feeling of selfless love. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neural substrate of loving kindness meditation in experienced meditators and novices. We first assessed group differences in blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD) signal during loving kindness meditation. We next used a relatively novel approach, the intrinsic connectivity distribution of functional connectivity, to identify regions that differ in intrinsic connectivity between groups, and then used a data-driven approach to seed-based connectivity analysis to identify which connections differ between groups. Our findings suggest group differences in brain regions involved in self-related processing and mind wandering, emotional processing, inner speech, and memory. Meditators showed overall reduced BOLD signal and intrinsic connectivity during loving kindness as compared to novices, more specifically in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus ( PCC/ PCu), a finding that is consistent with our prior work and other recent neuroimaging studies of meditation. Furthermore, meditators showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between the PCC/ PCu and the left inferior frontal gyrus, whereas novices showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between the PCC/ PCu and other cortical midline regions of the default mode network, the bilateral posterior insula lobe, and the bilateral parahippocampus/hippocampus. These novel findings suggest that loving kindness meditation involves a present-centered, selfless focus for meditators as compared to novices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study was a randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of meditation practice on the mental health outcomes of female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders. Sixty-three female trauma survivors were randomly assigned to the meditation condition and the control condition. Treatment conditions consisted of a 6-week meditation curriculum that was influenced by Tibetan meditation tradition and focused on breathing, loving kindness, and compassion meditation. Clients in the meditation condition made significant changes in mental health symptoms (t = 5.252, df = 31, p = .000) and trauma symptoms (t = 6.009, df = 31, p = .000) from pre-treatment to post-treatment, whereas non-significant changes were observed among the control condition clients. There were significant group differences between clients in the meditation condition and in the control condition on their mental health symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.438, p = .001, and trauma symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.395, p = .001, with a generally large effect size of eta squared .127 and .146, respectively. In addition, significantly more clients in the meditation condition achieved reliable change in mental health symptoms (35.5% vs. 8.3%) and trauma symptoms (42.3% vs. 4.8%) than clients in the control condition. Significance of the study is discussed with respect to the empirical evidence of meditation practice as a complementary behavioral intervention for treating female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders.

AB  - This paper is situated at the intersection of ethics, pedagogy, and bias. Various challenges for pedagogy that are posed by explicit and implicit bias are discussed. Potential solutions to such challenges are then explored. These include practices such as enhanced thought experiments, interviews, research projects, in-depth role-playing, action projects, and appropriately morally deferential experiential service-learning. Moral imagination can be beneficially stretched through adopting differing moral lenses and engaging and encouraging multiple empathizing; art and literary narrative provide helpful tools to this end. Also recommended is critical scrutiny focused on personal biases (including teacher bias) and developing curriculum focused on moral literacy. Such moves of necessity span from individual to public action given the environmental components of the operations of bias. Shaping ourselves through intentional environment construction and avoidance of undesirable environments is therefore identified as a valuable technique. Finally, the potential contribution of loving-kindness meditation is addressed. Although we may be unable at present to eradicate problematic forms of bias, there are multiple methods available to begin to ameliorate the harms associated with those forms of bias.

AB  - Introduction: Approximately 10-23% of people suffer from chronic pain. There is a specific program to improve selfcompassion, (MSC) developed by Neff and Germer, that is used in different clinical issues. Art Therapy, and which distinguish it from other therapies, is the active performing with materials, by means of the visual and concrete character of the process. Also, another relevant characteristic is the obtaining of an output in form of art making. In our study we decide to integrate MSC and art therapy. With both tecniques is possible to pay attention in a more specific and localy way. Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of MSC program, and MSC program with art therapy in order to improve Quality of Life, emotional regulation and Self-Care in chronic pain. Methods: We conducted a RCT with 2 arms of treatments in a chronic pain patients sample of Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid. Group interventions, 8 sessions, weekly. We collected data of anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, pain interference selfcompassion, and quality of life. Results: Patients with chronic pain who participated in the art therapy group reported greater satisfaction with the treatment. There was a significant abandonment of patients Conclusions: These results are promising in order to find other effective interventions to this prevalent clinical problem. By active performing and experiencing with art materials, by the visual and concrete character of the process as well as by the result of art making. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) is an efficient mental practice with a long history that has recently attracted interest in the fields of neuroscience, medicine and education. However, the neural characters and underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully illustrated, which has hindered its practical usefulness. This study aimed to investigate LKM from varied aspects and interactions between the brain, the heart, and psychological measurements. A Buddhist monk practitioner was recruited to complete one 10-min LKM practice, in between two 10-min resting tasks (pre- and post-resting) per experimental run. Two sets of single-channel wearable EEG devices were used to collect EEG data (placed at Fz and Pz) and heart rate simultaneously. A self-report evaluation was conducted to repeatedly record the comprehensive performance of mind and body in each session. EEG data were preprossessed and analyzed by EEGlab. Further statistics were made by SPSS. Spectrum analysis showed a significant increase of theta power (Fz: t = −3.356; p = 0.002; Pz: t = −5.199; p < 0.001) and decrease of heart rate between pre- and post-resting tasks (t = 4.092, p < 0.001). The analysis showed a negative correlation between theta power and heart rate (Fz: r = −0.681, p < 0.001; Pz: r = −0.384, p = 0.008), and a positive correlation between theta power and the self-designed report score (Fz: r = 0.601, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that LKM is accompanied by significant neurophysiological changes, mainly an increase in slower frequencies, such as theta, and a decrease in heart rate. More importantly, subjective psychological assessments were also correlated with objective neurophysiological measurements in a long-term meditator participant. During LKM meditation, this connection was stronger. The results of this case report have promising implications for LKM practice in daily life.

AB  - Our Western society is characterized by multitasking, competition, and constant time pressure. Negative effects of stress for the individual (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and for organizations and society (costs due to work absence) are very high. Thus, time-efficient self-help interventions to address these issues are necessary. This study assessed the effects of daily mindfulness meditations (MM) versus daily heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) and daily physical exercise (PE) on attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying. Young adults (n = 75, age range 18 to 40) with elevated stress levels were randomized to MM, HRV-BF, or PE, and measurements were taken at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. Interventions in all three groups were self-guided and lasted for 5 weeks. Generalized estimating equation analyses showed that overall, all three interventions were effective and did not differ from each other. However, practice time differed between groups, with participants in the PE group practicing much more than participants in the other two groups. Therefore, additional analyses were carried out in two subsamples. The optimal dose sample included only those participants who practiced for at least 70 % of the total prescribed time. In the equal dose sample, home practice intensity was equal for all three groups. Again, the effects of the three interventions did not differ. In conclusion, MM, HRV-BF, and PE are all effective self-help methods to improve attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying, and mindfulness meditation was not found to be more effective than HRV-biofeedback or physical exercise for these cognitive processes.

AB  - Reports an error in 'What kind of intervention is effective for improving subjective well-being among workers? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials' by Asuka Sakuraya, Kotaro Imamura, Kazuhiro Watanabe, Yumi Asai, Emiko Ando, Hisashi Eguchi, Norimitsu Nishida, Yuka Kobayashi, Hideaki Arima, Mai Iwanaga, Yasumasa Otsuka, Natsu Sasaki, Akiomi Inoue, Reiko Inoue, Kanami Tsuno, Ayako Hino, Akihito Shimazu, Akizumi Tsutsumi and Norito Kawakami (Frontiers in Psychology, 2020[Nov][13], Vol 11[528656]). In the published article, there was an error in Affiliation 3. The affiliation was listed as 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center Japan, Tokyo, Japan' but should be 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.' Affiliation 3 has now been updated. There was also an error in the results section: 'one meditation awareness training (acceptance commitment therapy: ACT)' should be 'one meditation awareness training (MAT) intervention.' A correction has been made to Results, Mindfulness. The corrected section is shown in the erratum. There was also an error in Table 1 as published. The corrected table is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-91067-001[/rid]). Objectives: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve subjective well-being (SWB), including evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of quality of life (QOL) of working population. Methods: A literature search was conducted, using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. Eligible studies included those that were RCTs of any intervention, conducted among healthy workers, measured SWB as a primary outcome, and original articles in English. Study characteristics, intervention, outcomes, and results on SWB outcomes were extracted by the investigators independently. After a brief narrative summarizing and classifying the contents of the interventions, the included outcomes were categorized into each aspect of SWB (evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of QOL). Finally, the characteristics of the effective interventions for increasing each aspect were summarized, and the pooled effect of interventions on SWB was investigated by a meta-analysis. Publication bias was investigated by drawing a funnel plot and conducting Egger's test. Results: From the 5,450 articles found, 39 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The interventions included in this review were classified into six categories (physical activity, ergonomics, psychological, environmental, multicomponent intervention, and others). The meta-analysis from 31 studies showed that the pooled effect of included interventions on SWB was significantly positive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.51; standard error (SE) = 0.10). A funnel plot showed there were extremely large or small SMDs, and Egger's test was significant. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analysis, excluding these extreme SMDs, and confirmed that the estimated pooled effect was also significantly positive. Subgroup analyses for separate types of interventions showed the effects of psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) were also significantly positive. Conclusion: The current study revealed the effectiveness of interventions for increasing SWB. Specifically, psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) may be useful for improving SWB.
