      intervention.

AB  - Mindfulness meditation is a set of attention-based, regulatory, and self-inquiry 
      training regimes. Although the impact of mindfulness training (MT) on 
      self-regulation is well established, the neural mechanisms supporting such 
      plasticity are poorly understood. MT is thought to act through interoceptive 
      salience and attentional control mechanisms, but until now conflicting evidence 
      from behavioral and neural measures renders difficult distinguishing their 
      respective roles. To resolve this question we conducted a fully randomized 6 week 
      longitudinal trial of MT, explicitly controlling for cognitive and treatment 
      effects with an active-control group. We measured behavioral metacognition and 
      whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals using functional MRI 
      during an affective Stroop task before and after intervention in healthy human 
      subjects. Although both groups improved significantly on a response-inhibition 
      task, only the MT group showed reduced affective Stroop conflict. Moreover, the 
      MT group displayed greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses during 
      executive processing, consistent with increased recruitment of top-down 
      mechanisms to resolve conflict. In contrast, we did not observe overall 
      group-by-time interactions on negative affect-related reaction times or BOLD 
      responses. However, only participants with the greatest amount of MT practice 
      showed improvements in response inhibition and increased recruitment of dorsal 
      anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior insula 
      during negative valence processing. Our findings highlight the importance of 
      active control in MT research, indicate unique neural mechanisms for progressive 
      stages of mindfulness training, and suggest that optimal application of MT may 
      differ depending on context, contrary to a one-size-fits-all approach.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as supportive therapy in cancer care: 
      systematic review.
PG  - 315-27
AB  - AIM: This paper reports a systematic review and critical appraisal of the 
      evidence on the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for cancer 
      supportive care. BACKGROUND: The experience of cancer can have a negative impact 
      on both psychological and physical health and on quality of life. 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is a therapy package that has been used with 
      patients with a variety of conditions. In order to draw conclusions on its 
      effectiveness for cancer patients, the evidence requires systematic assessment. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive search of major biomedical and specialist complementary 
      medicine databases was conducted. Additionally, efforts were made to identify 
      unpublished and ongoing research. Relevant research was categorized by study type 
      and appraised according to study design. Clinical commentaries were obtained for 
      each study and included in the review. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled 
      clinical trials and seven uncontrolled clinical trials were found. A lack of 
      relevant qualitative research studies was identified. Studies report positive 
      results, including improvements in mood, sleep quality and reductions in stress. 
      A dose-response effect has been observed between practice of Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction and improved outcome. A number of methodological limitations 
      were identified. Modifications to the traditional Mindfulness-Based Stress 
      Reduction programme make comparison between studies difficult and a lack of 
      controlled studies precludes any firm conclusion on efficacy. CONCLUSION: 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction has potential as a clinically valuable 
      self-administered intervention for cancer patients. Further research into its 
      efficacy, feasibility and safety for cancer patients in the nursing context is 
      recommended.

TI  - Comparing Effectiveness of HRV-Biofeedback and Mindfulness for Workplace Stress 
      Reduction: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 307-322
LID - 10.1007/s10484-020-09477-w [doi]
AB  - Psychophysiological disorders due to work-related stress continue to be highly 
      costly for health systems and approaches for cost-effective and easily accessible 
      interventions are much needed. Both heart rate variability-biofeedback (HRV-Bfb) 
      and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been empirically shown to reduce 
      stress. This study compares these two interventions in the work context to a 
      wait-list-control-group (WLC). In this three-armed randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT), 69 healthy adults employed in the same organization were randomized to 
      participate in HRV-Bfb, MBI or the WLC. Participants were assessed for 
      psychophysiological parameters of stress (stress perception, coping, HRV 
      parameters and cortisol) and stress related symptoms (depressive symptoms, 
      psychological wellbeing, mindfulness and self-compassion). Participants trained 
      using either HRV-Bfb or MBI for 6 weeks on a daily basis. Outcomes were assessed 
      at baseline, after the intervention and at follow-up 12 weeks later. Results did 
      not show any statistically significant differences between HRV-Bfb and MBI 
      groups, and neither of the intervention groups (IGs) differed from the WLC. 
      Findings suggest an overall reduction in stress for all groups, including the 
      WLC, with mostly small to medium effect sizes. However, it is important to note 
      that participants with higher baseline stress levels might benefit more from 
      mindfulness and biofeedback-based stress reduction interventions. The results 
      have to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small sample size. MBI 
      might have a slightly stronger effect on stress reduction in comparison to 
      HRV-Bfb, as suggested by the effect sizes. This study highlights issues and 
      challenges of the implementation of such interventions in corporate health 
      management.

TI  - Testing the Efficacy of a Multicomponent, Self-Guided, Smartphone-Based 
      Meditation App: Three-Armed Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e23825
LID - 10.2196/23825 [doi]
LID - e23825
AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest 
      psychological benefits associated with meditation training delivered via mobile 
      health. However, research in this area has primarily focused on mindfulness, only 
      one of many meditative techniques. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the 
      efficacy of 2 versions of a self-guided, smartphone-based meditation app-the 
      Healthy Minds Program (HMP)-which includes training in mindfulness (Awareness), 
      along with practices designed to cultivate positive relationships (Connection) or 
      insight into the nature of the self (Insight). METHODS: A three-arm, fully remote 
      RCT compared 8 weeks of one of 2 HMP conditions (Awareness+Connection and 
      Awareness+Insight) with a waitlist control. Adults (≥18 years) without extensive 
      previous meditation experience were eligible. The primary outcome was 
      psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress). Secondary outcomes were 
      social connection, empathy, compassion, self-reflection, insight, rumination, 
      defusion, and mindfulness. Measures were completed at pretest, midtreatment, and 
      posttest between October 2019 and April 2020. Longitudinal data were analyzed 
      using intention-to-treat principles with maximum likelihood. RESULTS: A total of 
      343 participants were randomized and 186 (54.2%) completed at least one posttest 
      assessment. The majority (166/228, 72.8%) of those assigned to HMP conditions 
      downloaded the app. The 2 HMP conditions did not differ from one another in terms 
      of changes in any outcome. Relative to the waitlist control, the HMP conditions 
      showed larger improvements in distress, social connectedness, mindfulness, and 
      measures theoretically linked to insight training (d=-0.28 to 0.41; Ps≤.02), 
      despite modest exposure to connection- and insight-related practice. The results 
      were robust to some assumptions about nonrandom patterns of missing data. 
      Improvements in distress were associated with days of use. Candidate mediators 
      (social connection, insight, rumination, defusion, and mindfulness) and 
      moderators (baseline rumination, defusion, and empathy) of changes in distress 
      were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence of efficacy 
      for the HMP app in reducing distress and improving outcomes related to 
      well-being, including social connectedness. Future studies should attempt to 
      increase study retention and user engagement. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To design a meditation protocol and test its feasibility, 
      acceptability and efficacy in conjunction with yoga training (YT) for persons 
      with schizophrenia (SZ). METHODS: The meditation protocol consisted of Anapana 
      (observing normal respiration) and Yoga Nidra (supine, restful awareness). In a 
      single-blind randomised controlled trial, medicated and clinically stable 
      outpatients diagnosed with SZ were randomised to receive treatment as usual 
      (TAU), TAU augmented with YT or TAU augmented with meditation and yoga training 
      (MYT) for 3 weeks (N = 145). Acceptability, clinical, social and cognitive 
      functions were assessed after 3-week and 3-month post-randomisation using 
      within-group and between-group analyses with repeated measures multivariate 
      tests. RESULTS: No group-wise differences in compliance, study discontinuation, 
      major/serious side effects or adverse events were noted. For six assessed 
      clinical variables, the direction of changes were in the desired direction and 
      the effect sizes were greater in the MYT group compared with the TAU group at 
      both time points. Changes in social function variables were greater at 3 months 
      than at 3 weeks. Nominally significant improvement in individual cognitive 
      domains were noted in all groups at both time points. All effect sizes were in 
      the small to medium range. CONCLUSION: MYT is feasible and acceptable and shows 
      modest benefits for persons with SZ. MYT can also improve quality of life and 
      clinical symptoms. Larger studies of longer duration are warranted.

AB  - To address the challenge of predicting psychological response to a psychosocial 
      intervention we tested the possibility that baseline gene expression profiles 
      might provide information above and beyond baseline psychometric measures. The 
      genomics strategy utilized individual level inferences of transcription factor 
      activity to predict changes in loneliness and affect in response to two 
      well-established meditation interventions. Initial algorithm development analyses 
      focused on three a-priori defined stress-related gene regulation pathways (CREB, 
      GR, and NF-ĸB) as inferred from TELiS promoter-based bioinformatic analysis of 
      basal (pre-intervention) blood samples from a randomized-controlled trial 
      comparing a compassion-based meditation (CM, n = 45) with mindfulness meditation 
      (MM, n = 44). Greater baseline CREB activity (but not GR or NF-ĸB) predicted 
      greater reductions from pre- to post-intervention in loneliness (b = -0.24, 
      p = 0.016) and negative emotions (b = -0.23, p = 0.017) for CM, but not for MM. A 
      second algorithm validation analysis applied the same approach to another 
      randomized controlled trial comparing CM (n = 42) with MM (n = 38) and a health 
      education control condition (n = 41). Similarly, greater baseline CREB activity 
      predicted greater pre- to post-intervention decreases in loneliness (b = -0.24, 
      p = 0.029) and greater increases in satisfaction with life (b = 0.21, p = 0.046) 
      for the CM condition only. Baseline CREB activity was not associated with 
      baseline psychometric measures in either study. Results raise the possibility 
      that pre-intervention gene expression profiles may reflect non-conscious 
      psychobiological states that affect psychological responses to distinct 
      psychosocial interventions, and thereby help personalize intervention selection.

TI  - Meditating on psychedelics. A randomized placebo-controlled study of DMT and 
      harmine in a mindfulness retreat.
PG  - 897-910

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, both meditation and psychedelics have attracted 
      rapidly increasing scientific interest. While the current state of evidence 
      suggests the promising potential of psychedelics, such as psilocybin, to enhance 
      meditative training, it remains equivocal whether these effects are specifically 
      bound to psilocybin or if other classical psychedelics might show synergistic 
      effects with meditation practice. One particularly promising candidate is 
      N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an active ingredient of ayahuasca. AIM: This study 
      aims to investigate the effect of the psychedelic substance DMT, combined with 
      the monoamine oxidase inhibitor harmine (DMT-harmine), on meditative states, 
      compared to meditation with a placebo. METHOD: Forty experienced meditators (18 
      females and 22 males) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
      over a 3-day meditation retreat, receiving either placebo or DMT-harmine. 
      Participants' levels of mindfulness, compassion, insight, and transcendence were 
      assessed before, during, and after the meditation group retreat, using 
      psychometric questionnaires. RESULTS: Compared to meditation with a placebo, 
      meditators who received DMT and harmine self-attributed greater levels of 
      mystical-type experiences, non-dual awareness, and emotional breakthrough during 
      the acute substance effects and, when corrected for baseline differences, greater 
      psychological insight 1 day later. Mindfulness and compassion were not 
      significantly different in the DMT-harmine group compared to placebo. At 1-month 
      follow-up, the meditators who received DMT and harmine rated their experience as 
      significantly more personally meaningful, spiritually significant, and 
      well-being-enhancing than the meditators who received placebo. CONCLUSION: 
      Investigating the impact of DMT-harmine on meditators in a naturalistic 
      mindfulness group retreat, this placebo-controlled study highlights the specific 
      effects of psychedelics during meditation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Extending the Transformative Potential of Mindfulness Through Team Mindfulness 
      Training, Integrating Individual With Collective Mindfulness, in a High-Stress 
      Military Setting.
PG  - 867110
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.867110 [doi]
LID - 867110
AB  - Mindfulness has come to be considered an important approach to help individuals 
      cultivate transformative capacity to free themselves from stress and suffering. 
      However, the transformative potential of mindfulness extends beyond individual 
      stress management. This study contributes to a broadening of the scope of 
      contemplative science by integrating the prominent, individually focused 
      mindfulness meditation literature with collective mindfulness scholarship. In so 
      doing, it aims to illuminate an important context in which mindfulness 
      interventions are increasingly prevalent: workplaces. Typically, the intended 
      effect of workplace mindfulness training is to help workers manage stress better. 
      Since mindfulness in organizations impacts individual and collective processes, 
      the study blends the above literatures to create a cross-level "next-generation" 
      Team Mindfulness Training (TMT) pilot. Its potential in helping individuals and 
      teams to manage work stress better is investigated via a two-phase mixed-methods 
      research study in high-stress military work populations, and compared to a 
      conventional ("first-generation") 8-week mindfulness meditation program based on 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Results suggest that compared to the 
      "first-generation" mindfulness program, TMT seems no less effective in raising 
      individual stress management skills, and may hold more promise in generating 
      collective capacity to manage stress and unexpected difficulty, linked to an 
      apparent interdependence between collective and individual mindfulness capacity 
      development. Based on these empirical results, the study contributes to theory in 
      three important ways: first, it outlines how individual and collective 
      mindfulness in workplaces may be interdependent. Second, it explains why 
      "next-generation" workplace training interventions should apply a cross-level 
      approach. And third, it illustrates how its transformative potential for people 
      at work, individually as well as collectively, can be extended by moving beyond 
      an inward-looking meditation focus in mindfulness training. The study contributes 
      to practice by providing a detailed outline of the pilot TMT program, and offers 
      a series of follow-up research opportunities to inspire further scientific 
      innovation in workplace mindfulness training, especially for high-stress work 
      populations. The study's ultimate aim is to prompt a shift away from adapting 
      clinically oriented, self-focused "first-generation" mindfulness training 
      protocols, and towards mindfulness as team sport: a more prosocially oriented 
      mindfulness science intent on generating wisdom and compassion, for one and all.

AB  - State body shame is a risk factor for eating disorders, and self-compassion is 
      emerging as a potentially effective treatment option in such cases. This study 
      tested the efficacy of a brief (15-minute) self-compassion intervention in 
      reducing state body shame. Using dismantling trial methodology, participants were 
      randomly allocated to an active compassion condition (n = 23), an inactive 
      control compassion condition (n = 23), or an educational control condition 
      (n = 23). Measures of state body image and state shame were collected 
      pre-intervention, immediately after the intervention, and a day after the 
      intervention. Subjective units of state body shame (SUBS) were intensively 
      measured during each invention. Self-compassion interventions were equally 
      efficacious at protecting against deterioration of state body shame and were 
      effective at reducing state shame compared to the educational control condition, 
      with medium effect sizes (respectively - n(p)(2) = .07 and n(p)(2) = .08). 
      Reductions in state shame were retained at follow-up. None of the interventions 
      had an effect on body image (n(p)(2) = .04). Findings demonstrate the clinical 
      promise of brief self-compassion interventions, particularly as evidenced-based 
      "homework" exercises.

TI  - Relative Impact of Mindfulness, Self-Compassion, and Psychological Flexibility on 
      Alcohol Use and Burnout Among Law Enforcement Officers.
PG  - 1190-1194
LID - 10.1089/acm.2020.0178 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: In the present study, we investigated the relative impact of 
      improvements in mindfulness, self-compassion, and psychological flexibility in 
      predicting decreased burnout and alcohol use in a sample of law enforcement 
      officers (LEOs) participating in a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI). Design: 
      This study is a secondary analysis of pre/post data collected as part of a larger 
      randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT). 
      Subjects: This secondary analysis comprises pre/post data from 28 LEOs recruited 
      from a metropolitan area and its outlying regions in the Pacific Northwest. 
      Intervention: MBRT is a MBI tailored specifically to the culture and needs of 
      LEOs and other first responders. Outcome measures: All included data were 
      obtained through self-report measures. Mindfulness was assessed by the Five Facet 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form, self-compassion was assessed by the 
      Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, psychological flexibility was assessed by the 
      Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, alcohol use was measured by the PROMIS(®) 
      (v1.0) Alcohol Use-Short Form, and burnout was assessed by the Oldenburg Burnout 
      Inventory. Results: In the first regression, only increases in mindfulness 
      significantly predicted decreased postintervention problematic alcohol use. In 
      the second regression, only increases in self-compassion significantly predicted 
      decreased postintervention burnout. Conclusions: This study builds upon a growing 
      body of literature on the relative impact of mindfulness, self-compassion, and 
      psychological flexibility in predicting outcomes among high-stress cohorts. 
      Results suggest that different components of MBIs may be emphasized to achieve 
      unique benefits. The Clinical Trial Registration number for the parent study is 
      NCT02521454.

      for urban youth.
PG  - 985-94
LID - 10.1007/s10802-010-9418-x [doi]
AB  - Youth in underserved, urban communities are at risk for a range of negative 
      outcomes related to stress, including social-emotional difficulties, behavior 
      problems, and poor academic performance. Mindfulness-based approaches may improve 
      adjustment among chronically stressed and disadvantaged youth by enhancing 
      self-regulatory capacities. This paper reports findings from a pilot randomized 
      controlled trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
      outcomes of a school-based mindfulness and yoga intervention. Four urban public 
      schools were randomized to an intervention or wait-list control condition (n=97 
      fourth and fifth graders, 60.8% female). It was hypothesized that the 12-week 
      intervention would reduce involuntary stress responses and improve mental health 
      outcomes and social adjustment. Stress responses, depressive symptoms, and peer 
      relations were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Findings suggest the 
      intervention was attractive to students, teachers, and school administrators and 
      that it had a positive impact on problematic responses to stress including 
      rumination, intrusive thoughts, and emotional arousal.

AB  - A growing body of research has revealed that social evaluative stressors trigger 
      biological and psychological responses that in chronic forms have been linked to 
      aging and disease. Recent research suggests that self-compassion may protect the 
      self from typical defensive responses to evaluation. We investigated whether 
      brief training in self-compassion moderated biopsychological responses to the 
      Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in women. Compared to attention (placebo) and 
      no-training control conditions, brief self-compassion training diminished 
      sympathetic (salivary alpha-amylase), cardiac parasympathetic, and subjective 
      anxiety responses, though not HPA-axis (salivary cortisol) responses to the TSST. 
      Self-compassion training also led to greater self-compassion under threat 
      relative to the control groups. In that social stress pervades modern life, 
      self-compassion represents a promising approach to diminishing its potentially 
      negative psychological and biological effects.

TI  - Four-Week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy for Family Dementia Caregivers: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial with Neural Circuit Changes.
PG  - 180-189
LID - 10.1159/000521950 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high burden of 
      depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) 
      provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced 
      mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the 
      hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and 
      improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would 
      increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual 
      anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers 
      participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n = 
      24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline 
      and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all 
      participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures 
      included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks 
      with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of 
      DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression. 
      DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes. 
      RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety, 
      mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect 
      sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC 
      connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC. 
      DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively 
      with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for 
      reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological 
      traits. Neuroimaging results suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with 
      an emotion regulation network might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.

      widespread worldwide. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of a 
      school-MBI (GrowingUp Breathing program) on children's socio-emotional and 
      academic development. Three hundred thirteen elementary students from 7 to 
      12 years old from two schools in Madrid (Spain) participated. A 
      cluster-randomized control trial was designed, assigning eight classrooms to the 
      MBI-group (N = 155) and eight classrooms to the waiting-list control group 
      (N = 158). Measures were evaluated at pre- and post-intervention in both groups 
      and a 3-month follow-up was collected in the MBI-group. Children self-reported 
      their mindfulness skills (i.e., dispositional mindfulness and psychological 
      inflexibility) and well-being (i.e., anxiety and life satisfaction) and teachers 
      evaluated children's social-emotional competence (i.e., emotion regulation, 
      peer-relationship problems, and prosociality), well-being (i.e., emotional 
      symptoms), and academic competence (i.e., student engagement and academic 
      achievement). Mindfulness skills and emotional regulation were examined as 
      potential mediators. Results revealed that children who received the MBI, 
      compared to children in the WLC-group, improved their mindfulness skills, emotion 
      regulation, prosociality, and emotional and behavioral engagement and decreased 
      anxiety and peer-relationship problems. Positive changes in dispositional 
      mindfulness led to reductions in children's anxiety and psychological 
      inflexibility. Positive changes in emotional regulation led to improvements in 
      prosociality and student engagement and decreased peer-relationships problems and 
      emotional symptoms. Therefore, the results showed that a brief-MBI integrated in 
      the Spanish regular school curriculum enhanced children's socio-emotional and 
      academic development. Dispositional mindfulness and emotion regulation work as 
      processes of change that underlie the intervention's impact.

TI  - Kindness Matters: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mindful Self-Compassion 
      Intervention Improves Depression, Distress, and HbA1c Among Patients With 
      Diabetes.
PG  - 1963-1971
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mood difficulties are common among patients with diabetes and are 
      linked to poor blood glucose control and increased complications. Evidence on 
      psychological treatments that improve both mood and metabolic outcomes is 
      limited. Greater self-compassion predicts better mental and physical health in 
      both healthy and chronically ill populations. Thus, the purpose of this 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the effects of self-compassion 
      training on mood and metabolic outcomes among patients with diabetes. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: This RCT tested the effects of a standardized 8-week mindful 
      self-compassion (MSC) program (n = 32) relative to a wait-list control condition 
      (n = 31) among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Measures of 
      self-compassion, depressive symptoms, diabetes-specific distress, and HbA(1c) 
      were taken at baseline (preintervention), at week 8 (postintervention), and at 
      3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA using intention to treat 
      showed that MSC training increased self-compassion and produced statistically and 
      clinically significant reductions in depression and diabetes distress in the 
      intervention group, with results maintained at 3-month follow-up. MSC 
      participants also averaged a clinically and statistically meaningful decrease in 
      HbA(1c) between baseline and follow-up of >10 mmol/mol (nearly 1%). There were no 
      overall changes for the wait-list control group. CONCLUSIONS: This initial report 
      suggests that learning to be kinder to oneself (rather than being harshly 
      self-critical) may have both emotional and metabolic benefits among patients with 
      diabetes.

TI  - A Randomized Trial of 21 Days of Loving Kindness Meditation for Stress Reduction 
      and Emotional Well-being Within an Online Health Community for Patients, Family, 
      and Friends Experiencing a Cancer Health Journey.
PG  - 158-167
LID - 10.1089/jicm.2020.0512 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: CaringBridge (CB) is an online health community for people undergoing 
      challenging health journeys. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is a systemized 
      mind-body approach developed to increase loving acceptance and has previously 
      been reported to increase resilience in the face of adversity. Materials and 
      Methods: Results of a randomized controlled trial of immediate compared with 
      deferred 21-day LKM intervention in an online community are reported. The 
      deferred group received LKM intervention after a waiting period of 3 weeks. 
      Inclusion criteria were >18 years old, ability to understand English, willingness 
      to participate in a mind-body practice, and use of CB for a cancer journey. 
      Change in perceived stress, self-compassion, social connectedness and assurance, 
      and compassionate love scales from baseline to 21 days was assessed. Results: Of 
      the 979 participants included in the study, 649 (66%) provided 3-week follow-up 
      data and 330 (49%) self-reported engaging in the LKM practice 5 or more 
      days/week. Participants in the immediate LKM group reported medium effect size 
      improvement in stress (0.4), self-compassion (0.5), and social connectedness 
      (0.4) compared with the deferred LKM group. Changes in perceived stress and 
      self-compassion were larger in magnitude and increased with more frequent 
      engagement in LKM. Conclusions: The immediate LKM group showed improvements in 
      stress, self-compassion, and social connectedness compared with the deferred 
      control group. Differential study retention rates by treatment arm and 
      self-reported engagement in LKM subject the results to selection bias. Future 
      research of similar interventions within online health communities might pay 
      greater attention to promoting intervention adherence and engaging a more diverse 
      economic and racial/ethnic population. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05002842).

TI  - The Effects of Tai Chi on Cardiovascular Risk in Women.
PG  - 613-622
AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of tai chi (TC) on biobehavioral factors 
      associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women. DESIGN: A randomized 
      trial used a wait-list control group, pretest-posttest design. Data were 
      collected immediately before, immediately after, and 2 months following the 
      intervention. SETTING: The study was community based in central Virginia. 
      SUBJECTS: Women aged 35 to 50 years at increased risk for CVD. INTERVENTION: The 
      8-week intervention built on prior work and was designed to impact biobehavioral 
      factors associated with CVD risk in women. MEASURES: Biological measures included 
      fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids as well as C-reactive protein and cytokines. 
      Behavioral measures included fatigue, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, 
      social support, mindfulness, self-compassion, and spiritual thoughts and 
      behaviors. ANALYSIS: A mixed effects linear model was used to test for 
      differences between groups across time. RESULTS: In 63 women, TC was shown to 
      decrease fatigue (∂ [difference in group means] = 9.38, p = .001) and granulocyte 
      colony stimulating factor (∂ = 12.61, p = .052). Consistent with the study model 
      and intervention design, significant changes observed 2 months post intervention 
      indicated that TC may help down-regulate proinflammatory cytokines associated 
      with underlying CVD risk, including interferon gamma (∂ = 149.90, p = .002), 
      tumor necrosis factor (∂ = 16.78, p = .002), interleukin (IL) 8 (∂ = 6.47, p = 
      .026), and IL-4 (∂ = 2.13, p = .001), and may increase mindfulness (∂ = .54, p = 
      .021), spiritual thoughts and behaviors (∂ = 8.30, p = .009), and self-compassion 
      (∂ = .44, p = .045). CONCLUSION: This study contributes important insights into 
      the potential benefits and mechanisms of TC and, with further research, may 
      ultimately lead to effective strategies for reducing CVD risk in women earlier in 
      the CVD trajectory.

TI  - A compassion-based treatment for couples with the female partner suffering from 
      current depressive disorder: A randomized-controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that depression and interpersonal relationships 
      are interdependently connected and that including the intimate partner in 
      treatment for depression has beneficial effects. Given evidence that compassion 
      is both an interpersonal quality and a promising treatment target, the goal of 
      this study was to examine the effects of a compassion-based, contemplative 
      treatment for couples employing a multi-method approach for evaluation. METHODS: 
      In a pre-post-follow-up design, n = 53 different-sex couples including women with 
      current depression were randomly assigned to a 10-week-long CBCT®-fC 
      (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training/intervention for couples) or 
      treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Multi-level linear regression models and 
      post-hoc contrasts were calculated to determine changes in depressive symptoms, 
      mindfulness and self-compassion, interpersonal functioning and neuroendocrine 
      markers collected during a partnership appreciation task (PAT) in the laboratory 
      before and after CBCT-fC treatment. RESULTS: While CBCT-fC led to a comparable 
      decrease of depressive symptoms as TAU, the training specifically increased 
      self-compassion and mindfulness versus TAU. Interestingly, interpersonal 
      functioning did not improve, which was also reflected in participants' preferred 
      self-focus in-between-session practices, instead of practices with interpersonal 
      focus. There were no group-specific changes in psychobiological stress-marker 
      reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: CBCT-fC was effective in decreasing current depressive 
      symptomatology and increasing mindfulness, and self-compassion. Especially the 
      motivation to participate, such as improving interpersonal functioning, should be 
      addressed and intrinsic motives of the partners to be involved. In highly 
      burdened individuals, self-regulation may need to be improved before 
      co-regulation can be addressed, which would requiring longer treatments. 
      Facilitating factors for engaging in the practice between-sessions seem 
      meaningful.

TI  - The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Association Between 
      Autonomic Interoceptive Signals and Emotion Regulation Selection.
PG  - 852-862

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to select the most adaptive regulatory strategy as a 
      function of the emotional context plays a pivotal role in psychological health. 
      Recently, we showed that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can improve the 
      sensitivity of regulatory strategy selection to emotional intensity. However, the 
      mechanisms underlying this improvement are unclear. In this study, we tested the 
      hypothesis that MBIs support adaptive regulatory selection by increasing 
      sensitivity to interoceptive signals associated with the emotional stimuli. 
      METHODS: Participants (n = 84, mean [standard deviation {SD}] age = 30.9 [8.3] 
      years; 54% women) were randomized to either a mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      (MBSR) program or a wait-list control condition. Before and after the MBSR 
      program, physiological measures for autonomic nervous system activity were 
      obtained, and participants performed a task examining emotion regulation 
      selections (reappraisal versus distraction) when confronted with low or high 
      negative intensity images. They also completed a battery of mindfulness, 
      interoception, and well-being self-report measures. A cross-classified model was 
      used for the main analyses. RESULTS: The participants assigned to the MBSR were 
      overall more likely to choose reappraisal than distraction (b = 0.26, posterior 
      SD = 0.13, 95confidence interval = 0.02-0.52) after the program. Interoceptive 
      signals in response to negative images were associated with subsequent regulatory 
      selections (b = 0.02, posterior SD = 0.01, 95% confidence interval = 0.01-0.03) 
      in the MBSR group. Specifically, lower cardiac reactivity was associated with the 
      choice to reappraise, whereas higher cardiac reactivity was related to the choice 
      to distract. Greater differences in cardiac reactivity between states that prompt 
      reappraisal and states that prompt distraction were associated with higher 
      well-being (Satisfaction With Life Scale, Pearson r (29) = 0.527, p = .003). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness seems to increase the sensitivity of regulatory 
      selections to interoceptive signals, and this is associated with subjective 
      well-being. This may be a central pathway through which MBIs exert their positive 
      effects on mental health and resilience.

TI  - Supporting antidepressant discontinuation using mindfulness plus monitoring 
      versus monitoring alone: A cluster randomized trial in general practice.

AB  - Discontinuing antidepressant medication (ADM) can be challenging for patients and 
      clinicians. In the current study we investigated if Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
      Therapy (MBCT) added to supported protocolized discontinuation (SPD) is more 
      effective than SPD alone to help patients discontinue ADM. This study describes a 
      prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial (completed). From 151 invited 
      primary care practices in the Netherlands, 36 (24%) were willing to participate 
      and randomly allocated to SPD+MBCT (k = 20) or SPD (k = 16). Adults using ADM > 9 
      months were invited by GPs to discuss tapering, followed by either MBCT+SPD, or 
      SPD alone. Exclusion criteria included current psychiatric treatment; substance 
      use disorder; non-psychiatric indication for ADM; attended MBCT within past 5 
      years; cognitive barriers. From the approximately 3000 invited patients, 276 
      responded, 119 participated in the interventions and 92 completed all 
      assessments. All patients were offered a decision aid and a personalized tapering 
      schedule (with GP). MBCT consisted of eight group sessions of 2.5 hours and one 
      full day of practice. SPD was optional and consisted of consultations with a 
      mental health assistant. Patients were assessed at baseline and 6, 9 and 12 
      months follow-up, non-blinded. In line with our protocol, primary outcome was 
      full discontinuation of ADM within 6 months. Secondary outcomes were depression, 
      anxiety, withdrawal symptoms, rumination, well-being, mindfulness skills, and 
      self-compassion. Patients allocated to SPD + MBCT (n = 73) were not significantly 
      more successful in discontinuing (44%) than those allocated to SPD (n = 46; 33%), 
      OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.49, p = .24, number needed to treat = 9. Only 20/73 
      allocated to MBCT (27%) completed MBCT. No serious adverse events were reported. 
      In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit of adding MBCT 
      to SPD to support discontinuation in general practice. Actual participation in 
      patient-tailored interventions was low, both for practices and for patients.

TI  - Modeling the mindfulness-to-meaning theory's mindful reappraisal hypothesis: 
      Replication with longitudinal data from a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 778-789
LID - 10.1002/smi.3035 [doi]
AB  - The Mindfulness to Meaning Theory provides a detailed process model of the 
      mechanisms by which mindfulness may promote well-being. Central to the 
      Mindfulness to Meaning Theory is the mindful reappraisal hypothesis (MRH), which 
      suggests mindfulness training promotes well-being by facilitating positive 
      reappraisal. Emerging evidence from interconnected domains of research supports 
      the MRH. However, it remains unclear whether mindful reappraisal continues to 
      develop after a mindfulness training course and whether this continued 
      development encourages well-being over time. As such, this randomized controlled 
      study compared participants receiving a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) 
      course with participants receiving no mindfulness training on positive 
      reappraisal use and well-being over the course of 6 years. Latent growth curve 
      modeling revealed that mindfulness training increased well-being by significantly 
      increasing the trajectory of positive reappraisal over time. The MRH was then 
      unpacked by examining whether MBSR also stimulated decentering and broadened 
      awareness, core components of the MRH. Multivariate path analysis revealed that 
      mindfulness training increased decentering, which in turn broadened awareness, 
      which was then associated with positive reappraisal, ultimately promoting 
      well-being. Taken together, these findings suggest that MBSR cultivates a 
      downstream cascade of adaptive psychological processes that continue to promote 
      quality of life 6-years after mindfulness training.

TI  - MinT-trial: Mindfulness versus cognitive behavioural therapy in Tinnitus 
      patients: protocol for a randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial.
PG  - e033210

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic subjective tinnitus is a condition that affects 5.1% to 
      42.7% of the population, depending on the definition and studied population. 
      Evidence-based treatment options are limited. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) 
      has been proven effective to improve quality of life and to diminish tinnitus 
      distress. Positive short-term effects of mindfulness-based interventions on 
      tinnitus distress have been reported; however, the longer term effects remain to 
      be studied. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We designed a monocentre randomised controlled, 
      non-inferiority trial to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (MBCT) and CBT in chronic tinnitus patients. Fifty-four patients (≥32 on 
      the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), suffering from tinnitus for at least 
      6 months) will be included in the trial and randomised into one of two 
      intervention groups. One group will receive MBCT, the other group will receive 
      CBT. Our primary objective is to determine whether MBCT is non-inferior to (as 
      good as) CBT on tinnitus distress (TFI) in chronic tinnitus patients at 12 months 
      follow-up after end of therapy. Non-inferiority will be declared if the mean 
      decrease in TFI score for MBCT is no worse than the mean decrease in TFI score in 
      CBT, with statistical variability, with a margin of 13 points. Most secondary 
      objectives (tinnitus severity of problem, tinnitus intrusiveness, quality of 
      life, anxiety, depression, symptoms of psychopathology, perceived tinnitus 
      complaints, coping style (mostly validated questionnaires)) are expected to show 
      non-inferiority to MBCT compared with CBT. We expect a significant difference 
      between MBCT and CBT for mindfulness awareness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This 
      research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the UMC 
      Utrecht (NL67838.041.18, V.4, April 2019). The trial results will be made 
      accessible to the public in a peer-review journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family caregiver interventions are essential to support dementia 
      caregiving. However, such interventions are typically complex and consist of 
      multiple components. Existing evidence rarely delineates the effectiveness and 
      interactions between individual components. To optimise intervention, we adopt 
      the multiphase optimisation strategy (MOST) to test the implementation fidelity 
      and determine the effect of each component and the interactions between each 
      component and the corresponding outcome. METHODS: A prospective, 
      assessor-blinded, randomised clinical trial with fractional factorial design 
      using the MOST principle. Two hundred fifty family dementia caregivers will be 
      randomised to one of 16 experimental conditions in a fractional factorial design 
      involving six intervention components: (1) dementia and caregiving education; (2) 
      self-care skills; (3) behavioural symptom management; (4) behavioural activation; 
      (5) modified mindfulness-based cognitive therapy; and (6) support group. The 
      first one is the core component, and the five remaining will be examined. 
      Physical health, caregiver burden, stress, psychological well-being, anxiety and 
      depressive symptoms, and social support will be assessed over the 12-month study 
      period. Following the intention-to-treat principle, linear mixed models and 
      regression analyses will be used to examine the specific effect of the five 
      components and their two-way interactions to propose the most effective 
      combination. DISCUSSION: This is the first study adopting the multiphase 
      optimisation strategy to identify the most active and engaging components of a 
      psychological intervention for caregivers of patients with dementia. In view that 
      dementia caregiver interventions are increasingly diversified and complex, such 
      knowledge is important to maximise the intervention efficacy and allow the 
      intervention to be implemented within an efficient timeframe and dosage. The 
      optimisation of caregiver support interventions is critical to enhance the health 
      outcomes of caregivers and care recipients, thereby, delaying possible 
      institutionalisation and reducing the costs of long-term dementia care. TRIAL

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training on Healthcare 
      Professionals' Mental Health: Results from a Pilot Study Testing Its Predictive 
      Validity in a Specialized Hospital Setting.

AB  - This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training and to examine positive and 
      negative symptom-focused mental health variables. The mental health variables 
      were used to test the predictive validity of the training among healthcare 
      professionals. Thirty healthcare professionals participated in this 
      non-randomized pre-post intervention pilot study. The questionnaire on mental 
      health was filled in twice. Baseline and post-intervention differences were 
      tested with paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The 
      participants' evaluation of the training was assessed with a five-item 
      questionnaire. The recruitment and retention were successful, and participants' 
      evaluation of the training itself was positive but the influence on daily life 
      was rated only moderately positive. In comparison with baseline at 
      post-intervention participants showed significant improvements in general 
      mindfulness, the burnout dimension personal accomplishment, quality of sleep, 
      positive emotions, and self-efficacy. A significant decrease was found in the 
      burnout dimension emotional exhaustion, stress level, negative emotions at work, 
      and worrying. No significant changes were found for the burnout dimension mental 
      distance, and work engagement. The measures showed ample within-person 
      differences and low, medium, or high effect sizes. The current trial approach of 
      the MBSR training seems feasible and acceptable. Our results suggest that 
      mindfulness, burnout, stress level, quality of sleep, positive emotions at work, 
      negative emotions at work, self-efficacy, and worrying are meaningful mental 
      health variables for inclusion in a larger-scale Randomized Controlled Trial on 
      the effects of MBSR.

AB  - In two studies using samples representative of the US adult population with 
      regard to age, sex and ethnicity, we investigated relationships between 
      loving-kindness and compassion-based practices with speciesism, animal solidarity 
      and desire to help animals. In a cross-sectional study (Study 1, N = 2,822), 
      results showed that past 30 days practice and estimated lifetime number of hours 
      of lovingkindness or compassion meditation were associated with more animal 
      solidarity and greater desire to help animals. Past 30 days practice was also 
      associated with less speciesism, but only when adjusting for sociodemographic 
      characteristics. In an experimental study (Study 2, N = 1,102), results showed 
      that participants randomized to a befriending meditation (a practice similar to 
      loving-kindness and compassion meditation) condition scored higher on animal 
      solidarity and desire to help animals than participants randomized to a control 
      condition. No significant difference was observed on speciesism, but mediation 
      analyses suggested that effects on all three outcomes were mediated through 
      perceived commonality with animals.

TI  - The MEDITAGING study: protocol of a two-armed randomized controlled study to 
      compare the effects of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program against a 
      health promotion program in older migrants in Luxembourg.
PG  - 2470

AB  - BACKGROUND: Migration is a phenomenon worldwide, with older migrants, 
      particularly those with fewer socioeconomic resources, having an increased risk 
      of developing adverse cognitive and health outcomes and social isolation. 
      Therefore, it is of utmost importance to validate interventions that promote 
      healthy aging in this population. Previous studies have shown a positive impact 
      of mindfulness based-stress reduction (MBSR) on outcomes such as cognition and 
      sleep. However, only a few studies verified its potential in older adults, 
      especially with vulnerable populations such as migrants. This article presents 
      the protocol of the MEDITAGING study, which is the first to investigate the MBSR 
      effects in migrants aged ≥55 in comparison to a health promotion program. 
      METHODS: MEDITAGING is a two-arm randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, 
      which will include older Portuguese-speaking migrants (n = 90). Participants are 
      randomized to the MBSR or a health promotion program. Both interventions are 
      conducted in groups over a total of 8 weeks, incorporating weekly meetings, an 
      additional 4-hour class, and extra at-home tasks. The health promotion program 
      has the same structure as the MBSR but comprises different activities related to 
      dementia prevention, healthy habits, cognitive stimulation, sleeping, nutrition, 
      watercolor painting, and physical activity. The assessment of executive 
      functioning, physiological stress measures, self-reported questionnaires, and 
      qualitative interviews are conducted at baseline, after 8 weeks 
      (post-intervention), and at a follow-up session (from one to 3 months 
      thereafter). Analyzes will be conducted using a modified intention-to-treat 
      approach (all participants with at least 3 days of participation in the 
      group-sessions and one post-intervention observation). DISCUSSION: This study 
      will test effects of a mindfulness-based intervention against an active control 
      condition in older adult migrants, which few studies have addressed. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of Koru, a mindfulness training program 
      for college students and other emerging adults. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety students 
      (66% female, 62% white, 71% graduate students) participated between Fall 2012 and 
      Spring 2013. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. It was hypothesized that Koru, 
      compared with a wait-list control group, would reduce perceived stress and sleep 
      problems, and increase mindfulness, self-compassion, and gratitude. RESULTS: As 
      hypothesized, results showed significant Group (Koru, Wait-List)×Time (Pre, Post) 
      interactions for improvements in perceived stress (F[1, 76.40]=4.50, p=.037, 
      d=.45), sleep problems (F [1, 79.49]=4.71, p=.033, d=.52), mindfulness (F [1, 
      79.09]=26.80, p<.001, d=95), and self-compassion (F[1, 74.77]=18.08, p<.001, 
      d=.75). All significant effects were replicated in the wait-list group. 
      Significant correlations were observed among changes in perceived stress, sleep 
      problems, mindfulness, and self-compassion. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the 
      effectiveness of the Koru program for emerging adults in the university setting.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions that span multiple sessions over time appear to 
      confer psychological benefits. However, the effects of brief periods of 
      mindfulness meditation training are less clear, particularly on measures of 
      cognitive functioning. This study assessed whether brief mindfulness practice 
      (breath awareness) or training in two other contemplative practices - 
      loving-kindness and gratitude - differentially impact working memory performance 
      following acute physiological stress relative to an attentional control. 
      Participants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to one of four training groups and 
      completed the automated Operation Span (OSPAN) task pre-training and again after 
      undergoing the cold pressor task. Three of the four groups improved in OSPAN 
      performance, with loving-kindness, gratitude, and attentional control conditions 
      showing increases in OSPAN relative to breath awareness. Changes in OSPAN were 
      not correlated with changes in positive or negative affect. It appears that brief 
      breath awareness training may not effectively buffer against acute stress in this 
      predominantly meditation naïve sample and may in fact impair subsequent cognitive 
      performance relative to a control or other contemplative practices. A granular 
      approach is warranted to understand potentially distinct and contextually 
      variable effects of different contemplative practices. Implications are discussed 
      in light of the stress buffering hypothesis and Monitor and Acceptance 
      Theory.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02214264.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of a daily 
      mindfulness practice and 2 types of journaling on participants' development of 
      self-compassion. METHOD: This was a between-groups design. All participants in a 
      graduate counseling course engaged in a short daily mindfulness practice at the 
      beginning of every class. Participants were randomly assigned to a counseling 
      journal or a gratitude journal group. Participants were to write in their 
      journals 2 to 5 times a week for the duration of the class. Participants 
      completed the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) and a questionnaire created by 
      the 1st author before any mindfulness sessions were held and again at the 
      completion of the course. RESULTS: Participants' level of self-compassion 
      increased from pretest to posttest. The self-compassion scores of participants 
      who kept counseling journals increased more than did those of participants who 
      kept gratitude journals. Qualitative data indicated that participants believed 
      that mindfulness was an important quality for clinicians to possess and that they 
      were accepting of the daily mindfulness practice. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in a 
      12-min daily mindfulness practice utilizing simple yoga postures, breath work, 
      reflective writing, and journaling done at a separate time appears to be an 
      effective technique for increasing students' levels of self-compassion. 
      Maintaining a counseling journal as opposed to a gratitude journal appears to 
      enhance the effect of the daily mindfulness practice on self-compassion.

AB  - Mind-body interventions such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) may 
      improve well-being by increasing awareness and regulation of physiological and 
      cognitive states. However, it is unclear how practice may alter long-term, 
      baseline physiological processes, and whether these changes reflect improved 
      well-being. Using respiration rate (RR), which can be sensitive to effects of 
      meditation, and 3 aspects of self-reported well-being (psychological well-being 
      [PWB], distress, and medical symptoms), we tested pre-registered hypotheses that: 
      (1) Lower baseline RR (in a resting, non-meditative state) would be a 
      physiological marker associated with well-being, (2) MBSR would decrease RR, and 
      (3) Training-related decreases in RR would be associated with improved 
      well-being. We recruited 245 adults (age range = 18-65, M = 42.4): experienced 
      meditators (n = 42), and meditation-naïve participants randomized to MBSR 
      (n = 72), active control (n = 41), or waitlist control (n = 66). Data were 
      collected at pre-randomization, post-intervention (or waiting), and long-term 
      follow-up. Lower baseline RR was associated with lower psychological distress 
      among long-term meditators (p* = 0.03, b = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.03]), though not 
      in non-meditators prior to training. MBSR decreased RR compared to waitlist 
      (p = 0.02, Cohen's d = - 0.41, 95% CI [- 0.78, - 0.06]), but not the active 
      control. Decreased RR related to decreased medical symptoms, across all 
      participants (p* = 0.02, b = 0.57, 95% CI [0.15, 0.98]). Post-training, lower RR 
      was associated with higher PWB across training groups compared to waitlist 
      (p* = 0.01, b = 0.06, 95% CI [0.02, 0.10]), though there were no significant 
      differences in change in PWB between groups. This physiological marker may 
      indicate higher physical and/or psychological well-being in those who engage in 
      wellness practices.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Enhancing the well-being of urban school students is a growing 
      challenge. The online mode of teaching during and post-pandemic era has increased 
      students' daily screen time. As they spend more time indoors, they tend to 
      disconnect from nature even more, adversely impacting their well-being. This 
      study aimed to design and execute two well-being interventions-a positive 
      psychology intervention (PPI) and a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in 
      natural settings for urban school students in India. METHODS: One hundred eighty 
      participants (aged 17-20) from a senior secondary school were randomly assigned 
      to three groups: PPI, MBI, and a control group (CTR). Participants self-reported 
      their levels of well-being, gratitude, inclusion of nature in self, sense of 
      connectedness, resilience, awareness, perceived stress, and positive and negative 
      emotions using a survey questionnaire at two times-pre- and post-interventions. 
      Repeated-measures ANOVA was employed across time and groups, and post hoc 
      analyses for group differences were carried out through the Bonferroni test. 
      RESULTS: Results indicate that both PPI and MBI interventions, when executed in 
      natural settings, enhance student well-being, gratitude, inclusion of nature in 
      self, sense of connectedness, resilience, awareness, positive emotions and 
      decreased levels of perceived stress, and negative emotions. DISCUSSION: The 
      study provides valuable insights for school authorities, policymakers, and urban 
      planners to include natural settings in school premises and offer well-being 
      interventions for students to connect with nature consciously.

TI  - MITIG.RA: study protocol of a tailored psychological intervention for managing 
      fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 651
LID - 10.1186/s13063-023-07692-4 [doi]
LID - 651
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite remarkable medical advances in the treatment of rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA), a subset of patients fails to achieve complete clinical 
      remission, as the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity remains 
      above 1, even after the inflammatory process is brought under control. This 
      so-called state of 'PGA-near-remission' negatively impacts individuals' 
      functioning and potentiates inadequate care. Fatigue is a distressing and 
      disabling symptom frequently reported by patients in PGA-near-remission, and its 
      management remains challenging. While classic cognitive-behavioural interventions 
      show some benefits in managing fatigue, there is potential for improvement. 
      Recently, contextual-cognitive behavioural therapies (CCBT), like mindfulness, 
      acceptance, and compassion-based interventions, have shown promising results in 
      fatigue-associated disorders and their determinants. This study primarily aims to 
      examine the efficacy of the Compassion and Mindfulness Intervention for RA 
      (MITIG.RA), a novel intervention combining different components of CCBT, compared 
      to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in the management of RA-associated fatigue. Secondary 
      aims involve exploring whether MITIG.RA produces changes in the perceived impact 
      of disease, satisfaction with disease status, levels of depression, and 
      emotion-regulation skills. METHODS: This is a single center, two-arm parallel 
      randomized controlled trial. Patients will be screened for eligibility and 
      willingness to participate and will be assessed and randomized to the 
      experimental (MITIG.RA + TAU) or control condition (TAU) using computer 
      randomization. MITIG.RA will be delivered by a certified psychologist and 
      comprises eight sessions of 2 h, followed by two booster sessions. Outcomes will 
      be assessed through validated self-report measures, including fatigue (primary 
      outcome), perceived impact of disease, depressive symptoms, mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, safety, and satisfaction (secondary outcomes). Assessment will 
      take place at baseline, post-intervention, before the first and second booster 
      sessions (weeks 12 and 20, respectively), and at 32 and 44 weeks after the 
      interventions' beginning. DISCUSSION: We expect MITIG.RA to be effective in 
      reducing levels of RA-associated fatigue. Secondarily, we hypothesize that the 
      experimental group will show improvements in the overall perceived impact of 
      disease, emotional distress, and emotion regulation skills. Our findings will 
      contribute to determine the benefits of combining CCBT approaches for managing 
      fatigue and associated distress in RA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Effectiveness of four deconstructive meditative practices on well-being and 
      self-deconstruction: study protocol for an exploratory randomized controlled

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of interventions based on mindfulness and compassion 
      has been demonstrated in both clinical and general population, and in different 
      social contexts. These interventions include so-called attentional and 
      constructive meditation practices, respectively. However, there is a third group, 
      known as deconstructive meditation practices, which has not been scientifically 
      studied. Deconstructive practices aim to undo maladaptive cognitive patterns and 
      generate knowledge about internal models of oneself, others and the world. 
      Although there are theoretical and philosophical studies on the origin of 
      addiction to the self or on the mechanisms of action associated with the 
      deconstruction of the self, there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating 
      these techniques in either a healthy population or clinical samples. This study 
      aims to evaluate the effect of three deconstructive techniques by comparing them 
      to mindfulness in the general population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomized 
      controlled clinical trial will be conducted with about 240 participants allocated 
      to four groups: (a) mindful breathing, (b) prostrations, according to Tibetan 
      Buddhist tradition; (c) the Koan Mu, according to Zen Buddhist tradition; and (d) 
      the mirror exercise, according to Toltec tradition. The primary outcome will be 
      the qualities of the non-dual experience and spiritual awakening, measured by the 
      Nondual Embodiment Thematic Inventory, assessed at pre- and post-treatment and at 
      3- and 6-month follow-ups. Other outcomes will be mindfulness, happiness, 
      compassion, affectivity and altered state of consciousness. Quantitative data 
      will be compared using mixed-effects linear regression models, and qualitative 
      data will be analysed through thematic analysis and using the constant 
      comparative method from grounded theory. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was 
      obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of Aragon, Spain. The results will be 
      submitted to peer-reviewed specialized journals, and brief reports will be sent 
      to participants on request. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05317754.

PG  - 751-764
LID - 10.1007/s12671-016-0653-2 [doi]
AB  - Families living with mental illness express needs of support and experiences of 
      burden that may affect their own health detrimentally and hence also their 
      ability to support the patient. Mindfulness-based interventions have shown 
      beneficial health effects in both clinical and healthy populations. The aim of 
      the current study was to explore the effectiveness and usability of a web-based 
      mindfulness program for families living with mental illness, which was first 
      tested in a feasibility study. The study was designed as a randomized controlled 
      trial with an experiment group and a wait-list control group with assessments on 
      primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month 
      follow-up. Significant positive improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion, 
      and significant decreases in perceived stress and in certain dimensions of 
      caregiver burden were found, with good program usability. Easily accessible 
      mindfulness-based interventions may be useful in addressing caregivers' needs of 
      support and in preventing further ill health in caregivers. Further studies are 
      needed, among others, to further customize interventions and to investigate the 
      cost-effectiveness of such programs.

TI  - Mechanisms of improvement in generalized anxiety disorder: A mediation and 
      moderated mediation analysis from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 196-208
LID - 10.1111/bjc.12402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with the lowest 
      treatment response rate among all anxiety disorders. Understanding mechanisms of 
      improvement may help to develop more effective and personalized treatments. AIM: 
      The objective of the study was to investigate different improvement mechanisms in 
      the treatment of individuals diagnosed with GAD. DESIGN: We reported data from a 
      randomized controlled trial that evaluated three different GAD treatments 
      (mindfulness-based intervention, BMT; fluoxetine, FLX; and an active comparison 
      group, QoL) for 8 weeks. METHOD: Mediation analyses were performed evaluating the 
      association between worry symptoms at baseline and anxiety scoring at the 
      endpoint, considering self-compassion or mindfulness or its dimensions at 
      mid-treatment as mediators for the whole sample (assessing GAD improvement 
      mechanism) and the different interventions as moderators. RESULTS: Contrary to 
      mindfulness state scoring (C = .06; 95% CI = -.05 to .20), self-compassion 
      (C = .11; 95% CI = .01 to .28) and non-judgement of inner experience (C = .10; 
      95% CI = .004 to .21) mediated the association between worry symptoms at baseline 
      and anxiety at the endpoint. When comparing BMT to FLX, the intervention modality 
      did not moderate these associations. CONCLUSION: Self-compassion and 
      non-judgement of inner experience seem to be essential targets in GAD treatment, 
      contrary to the mindfulness state itself. Although no difference was found 
      considering the intervention modality, future research may assess how to boost 
      these dimensions in specific treatments for GAD.

TI  - An evaluation of compassion-focused therapy within adult mental health inpatient 
      settings.
PG  - 587-602
LID - 10.1111/papt.12334 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a compassion-focused 
      therapy (CFT) group in improving patient outcomes compared to those receiving 
      treatment as usual (TAU) with a trans-diagnostic population who are inpatients 
      within an acute psychiatric ward. DESIGN: Quantitative data were gathered as part 
      of routine clinical practice within three adult psychiatric wards using the 
      Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at admission 
      and discharge and non-standardized Likert scales pre- and post-group sessions. 
      METHOD: Between April and August 2017, the Acute Psychology Service (APS) 
      gathered CORE-OM admission and discharge data from inpatients across three acute 
      wards (n = 32) whilst 249 pre/post-group data sets were gathered from CFT group 
      work undertaken on the inpatient wards. Current inpatients self-allocated to 
      receive either CFT or TAU based on their desire for psychological involvement. 
      Those self-allocating to receive psychological involvement (n = 19) were compared 
      to those who did not (n = 13) across the four subdomains of the CORE-OM: 
      Wellbeing, Functioning, Problem/Symptoms, and Risk. The Likert scales included 
      subdomains to evaluate changes in self-compassion, compassion to others, and 
      threat. Those receiving CFT group work also received TAU. RESULTS: Significant 
      improvements to all CORE-OM subdomains were observed for those receiving CFT 
      group input, in particular the Wellbeing and Functioning subdomains. Those 
      receiving TAU only noted a significant improvement in the area of Risk whilst 
      levels of Wellbeing were identical at admission and discharge with no 
      improvements noted. Pre/post-group results indicated significant results for 
      areas of self-compassion and compassion to others, whilst results by session for 
      the threat subdomain are mixed dependant on session. Overall, all areas noted 
      significant improvements. Session content was observed to be most effective for 
      breathing and Mindfulness-based sessions and those utilizing imagery techniques. 
      CONCLUSION: Compassion-Focused Therapy appears to be an effective group 
      intervention for a trans-diagnostic population within adult inpatient settings. 
      Patient outcomes are positively improved across a range of areas whilst 
      undertaking psychological input in the form of CFT group work whilst also 
      receiving TAU during an inpatient admission. The use of the CFT model to address 
      trans-diagnostic difficulties supports targeting underlying psychological 
      constructs in comparison to symptom treatment alone. PRACTITIONER POINTS: 
      Compassion-focused therapy is a multi-model approach designed to target high 
      levels of self-criticism. Previous research has demonstrated its effectiveness 
      for a range of specific diagnosis; however, there is a limited research base with 
      open groups and a trans-diagnostic population. Groups can be structured with 
      standalone sessions to accommodate the unpredictable admissions and discharge 
      patterns of acute psychiatric wards. Group sessions focused around Mindfulness 
      and Imagery yielded the greatest significant improvements to pre-sessions scores. 
      The provision of compassion-focused therapy groups within trans-diagnostic 
      inpatient settings is feasible and has shown to significantly improve overall 
      levels of distress and risk compared to those receiving treatment as usual. The 
      lack of standardized Likert group measures limits the power of the study. Whilst 
      a RCT would provide more reliable data, this was not possible as part of routine 
      clinical practice for ethical reasons.

AB  - The current study evaluated the efficacy of a three-week self-compassion (SC) 
      meditation intervention in improving body image and SC during pregnancy and 
      postpartum. Participants (n = 71; age = 31.92 ± 3.98 years; white = 61, 85.9%; 
      intervention = 35, 49.3%; pregnant = 33, 46.5%; postpartum = 38, 53.5%) were 
      recruited from a health coaching program and 35 were randomly assigned into a 
      three-week SC meditation intervention while 36 were randomly assigned to a 
      waitlist control condition. Linear regressions using full-information maximum 
      likelihood estimation examined the effect of intervention group on body image and 
      SC outcomes controlling for baseline level of outcome, pregnancy or postpartum 
      status, previous meditation experience, and physical activity. Results indicated 
      women in the intervention group reported significantly reduced body shame and 
      body dissatisfaction and improved body appreciation and self-compassion compared 
      to women in the control group. Implementation of a brief SC meditation 
      intervention during pregnancy and postpartum has potential to improve mental 
      health outcomes related to body image. Future work should replicate this study 
      with a larger, more diverse sample of women.

TI  - Group mindful self-compassion training to improve mental health outcomes for 
      LGBTQIA+ young adults: Rationale and protocol for a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young adults who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or 
      questioning, intersex, asexual and other diverse genders and sexualities 
      (LGBTQIA+) are more likely to experience mental health difficulties and are at 
      significantly elevated risk of substance abuse, self-harm and suicide, relative 
      to their heterosexual, endosex and cisgender peers. There is a need for effective 
      mental health interventions for LGBTQIA+ young adults. Mindful Self-Compassion 
      training is a promising approach; among LGBTQIA+ individuals, self-compassion 
      accounts for more variation in mental health outcomes than bullying, 
      victimization, and adverse childhood experiences combined. Furthermore, LGBTQIA+ 
      individuals with high self-compassion report more positive identity and 
      happiness, less self-stigma, and lower suicidality than those with low 
      self-compassion. METHOD: This paper outlines the rationale and protocol for a 
      single-blind CONSORT-compliant randomised controlled trial, comparing group 
      Mindful Self-Compassion to a delayed-treatment waitlist control group, for 
      improving mental health, decreasing self-criticism and increasing self-compassion 
      in LGBTQIA+ young adults (age 18-25 years). Mindful Self-Compassion training is 
      an 8-week group program that focuses on cultivating self-compassion and 
      mindfulness. While typically delivered as a face-to-face program, the proposed 
      trial will investigate efficacy of the program when provided via 
      videoconferencing. DISCUSSION: Videoconference Mindful Self-Compassion training 
      has the potential to improve the mental health of Australian LGBTQIA+ young 
      adults and provide a possible cost-effective, scalable intervention for this 
      population. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for 
      LGBTQIA+ young adults and will provide the first data on the delivery of the 
      program via videoconferencing.

      Single-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 63-78
LID - 10.1080/00207144.2022.2160257 [doi]
AB  - The effectiveness of the novel intervention mindful hypnotherapy on depression, 
      self-compassion, and psychological inflexibility in females with major depressive 
      disorder was examined in a randomized, clinical trial. Thirty-four participants 
      were randomly allocated into mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups. 
      The intervention group was treated in 8 face-to-face, 60-minute weekly therapy 
      sessions along with mindful hypnosis audio tapes to be used daily. The results of 
      analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences between 
      the mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups after intervention and at 
      2-month follow-up (p < .001). The between-subject test of repeated measures 
      ANOVAs also indicated a clinically significant difference between groups across 
      time (baseline, postintervention, and 2-month follow-up) in depression, F 
      = 53.86, p < .001, effect size = .65, and in self-compassion, F = 33.18, p 
      < .001, effect size = .53, as well as psychological inflexibility, F = 26.84, p 
      < .001, effect size = .48. In conclusion, this study indicates that mindful 
      hypnotherapy is an effective intervention for treating depression as well as 
      reducing psychological inflexibility and improving self-compassion for patients 
      with major depressive disorder.

AB  - Physicians are experiencing epidemic levels of work-related stress and burnout. 
      Determine efficacy of mindfulness meditation delivered as a hybrid (in-person and 
      digital) format to reduce perceived stress in pediatric residents. Pediatric 
      residents (n = 66) were block randomized to a hybrid Mindful Awareness Practices 
      (MAPs) intervention, comprised of one in-person 60-min session and 6-week access 
      to a digitally delivered MAPs curriculum (n = 27) or wait-list control (n = 39). 
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered at baseline and post-intervention 
      as the primary outcome measure. A priori secondary outcomes were measured using 
      the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory-9, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck 
      Anxiety Inventory, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. 
      After the first session, 58% participated at least one digital session (M = 2.0; 
      SD = 1.3). MAPs participants showed significant decrease in PSS compared to 
      controls, with between-group mean difference of 2.20 (95% CI 0.47-3.93) at 
      post-intervention (effect size 0.91; 0.19-1.62). No secondary outcome group 
      differences were detected. Exposure to a hybrid mindfulness intervention was 
      associated with improvement in perceived stress among pediatric residents.Trial 
      Registration: NCT03613441.

TI  - Evaluation of a stand-alone mobile mindfulness app in people experiencing 
      infertility: the protocol for an exploratory randomised controlled trial 
      (MoMiFer-RCT).

LID - e050088
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infertility and its treatment bring a considerable emotional 
      burden. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of 
      smartphone-delivered mindfulness apps for reducing symptoms of emotional distress 
      in both clinical and non-clinical populations. Evidence on this topic in women, 
      men and couples experiencing infertility is currently under-represented. The aim 
      of the MoMiFer study is, therefore, to investigate the efficacy of a stand-alone 
      mobile mindfulness app on symptoms of emotional distress and fertility-related 
      quality of life in people experiencing infertility. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 
      study is an exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with open enrollment. 
      The primary outcomes are symptoms of emotional distress and fertility-related 
      quality of life. Secondary outcomes are mindfulness skills, repetitive negative 
      thinking, self-compassion, user-rated quality of the stand-alone mobile 
      mindfulness app and use of the app. Experience sampling method and standardised 
      self-report questionnaires are combined within a repeated measures design to 
      measure the effects of the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app on the primary and 
      secondary outcomes, apart from the use of the app. The latter will be evaluated 
      through app tracking. People, including women, men and couples, experiencing 
      infertility (n=60) will be randomised to an intervention group receiving the 
      stand-alone mobile mindfulness app for 3 months or a wait-list control group. The 
      app follows the format and content of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Data 
      will be collected at baseline, at 1.5 months and 3 months after randomisation. 
      Analysis will be according to intention to treat and based on general linear 
      modelling and multilevel mixed-effects modelling. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This 
      study received approval from the Medical Ethical Committee of the Leuven 
      University Hospital (Belgium). The findings of this exploratory RCT will be 
      disseminated through presentations at public lectures, scientific institutions 
      and meetings, and through peer-reviewed scientific articles. TRIAL REGISTRATION 
      NUMBER: NCT04143828.

TI  - Antenatal mobile-delivered mindfulness-based intervention to reduce perinatal 
      depression risk and improve obstetric and neonatal outcomes: A randomized 
      controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: One in five mothers will experience perinatal depression (PND) during 
      pregnancy and within their first year following childbirth. Current evidence 
      suggests the short-term efficacy of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for 
      perinatal women, but the extent to which this positive impact remains the early 
      postpartum period is unclear. This study investigated the short- and maintenance 
      efficacy of a mobile-delivered four-immeasurable MBI on PND, and obstetric and 
      neonatal outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-five adult pregnant women suffering from 
      heightened distress were randomized to receive a mobile-delivered 
      four-immeasurable MBI (n = 38) or a web-based perinatal education program 
      (n = 37). PND was measured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at baseline, 
      post-intervention, 37th-week gestation, and 4-6 weeks postpartum. Outcomes also 
      included obstetric and neonatal outcomes, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and 
      positive affect. RESULTS: Participants reported an average age of 30.6 (SD = 3.1) 
      years with a mean gestational age of 18.8 (SD = 4.6) weeks. In intention-to-treat 
      analyses, women in the mindfulness group showed a significantly greater reduction 
      in depression from baseline to post-intervention (adjusted mean change difference 
      [β] = -3.9; 95%CI = [-6.05, -1.81]; d = -0.6), and the reduction sustained until 
      4-6 weeks postpartum (β = -6.3; 95%CI = [-8.43, -4.12]; d = -1.0), compared with 
      control. They had a significantly reduced risk of emergent cesarean section 
      (relative risk = 0.5) and gave birth to infants with higher Apgar scores 
      (β = 0.6;p = .03; d = 0.7). Depression reduction before giving birth 
      significantly mediated the intervention effect on lowering the emergency cesarean 
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: With a reasonably low dropout rate (13.2 %), the 
      mobile-delivered MBI can be an acceptable and effective intervention for reducing 
      depression throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Our study also suggests the 
      potential benefits of early prevention for mitigating emergent cesarean section 
      risk and enhancing neonatal health.

LID - CD010806
AB  - BACKGROUND: Being diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and labelled 
      with a chronic, life-threatening, and often stigmatizing disease, can impact on a 
      person's well-being. Psychosocial group interventions aim to improve 
      life-functioning and coping as individuals adjust to the diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: 
      To examine the effectiveness of psychosocial group interventions for improving 
      the psychological well-being of adults living with HIV/AIDS. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched the following electronic databases up to 14 March 2016: the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in the Cochrane Library 
      (Issue 2, 2016), PubMed (MEDLINE) (1996 to 14 March 2016), Embase (1996 to 14 
      March 2016), and Clinical Trials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared psychosocial group interventions with 
      versus control (standard care or brief educational interventions), with at least 
      three months follow-up post-intervention. We included trials that reported 
      measures of depression, anxiety, stress, or coping using standardized scales. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened 
      abstracts, applied the inclusion criteria, and extracted data. We compared 
      continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals 
      (95% CIs), and pooled data using a random-effects model. When the included trials 
      used different measurement scales, we pooled data using standardized mean 
      difference (SMD) values. We reported trials that we could not include in the meta 
      analysis narratively in the text. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using 
      the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 trials (19 articles) that 
      enrolled 2520 adults living with HIV. All the interventions were multifaceted and 
      included a mix of psychotherapy, relaxation, group support, and education. The 
      included trials were conducted in the USA (12 trials), Canada (one trial), 
      Switzerland (one trial), Uganda (one trial), and South Africa (one trial), and 
      published between 1996 and 2016. Ten trials recruited men and women, four trials 
      recruited homosexual men, and two trials recruited women only. Interventions were 
      conducted with groups of four to 15 people, for 90 to 135 minutes, every week for 
      up to 12 weeks. All interventions were conducted face-to-face except two, which 
      were delivered by telephone. All were delivered by graduate or postgraduate 
      trained health, psychology, or social care professionals except one that used a 
      lay community health worker and two that used trained mindfulness 
      practitioners.Group-based psychosocial interventions based on cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) may have a small effect on measures of depression, and 
      this effect may last for up to 15 months after participation in the group 
      sessions (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.10; 1139 participants, 10 trials, low 
      certainty evidence). Most trials used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which 
      has a maximum score of 63, and the mean score in the intervention groups was 
      around 1.4 points lower at the end of follow-up. This small benefit was 
      consistent across five trials where participants had a mean depression score in 
      the normal range at baseline, but trials where the mean score was in the 
      depression range at baseline effects were less consistent. Fewer trials reported 
      measures of anxiety, where there may be little or no effect (four trials, 471 
      participants, low certainty evidence), stress, where there may be little or no 
      effect (five trials, 507 participants, low certainty evidence), and coping (five 
      trials, 697 participants, low certainty evidence).Group-based interventions based 
      on mindfulness have not demonstrated effects on measures of depression (SMD 
      -0.23, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.03; 233 participants, 2 trials, very low certainty 
      evidence), anxiety (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.15; 62 participants, 2 trials, 
      very low certainty evidence), or stress (MD -2.02, 95% CI -4.23 to 0.19; 137 
      participants, 2 trials, very low certainty evidence). No mindfulness based 
      interventions included in the studies had any valid measurements of coping. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Group-based psychosocial interventions may have a small 
      effect on measures of depression, but the clinical importance of this is unclear. 
      More high quality evidence is needed to assess whether group psychosocial 
      intervention improve psychological well-being in HIV positive adults.

TI  - Investigating differential effects of socio-emotional and mindfulness-based 
      online interventions on mental health, resilience and social capacities during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic: The study protocol.
PG  - e0256323
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0256323 [doi]
LID - e0256323
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a mental health crisis on a global 
      scale. Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health 
      problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of 
      disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively 
      affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is 
      embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate 
      longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the 
      pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online 
      mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing 
      psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique 
      opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual 
      biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during 
      the pandemic in 2020/21. METHODS: We will examine the differential effects of a 
      socio-emotional (including 'Affect Dyad') and a mindfulness-based (including 
      'Breathing Meditation') intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone 
      application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be 
      compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will 
      be evaluated in a community sample (N = 300), which is recruited from the 
      original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, 
      potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a 
      wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, 
      resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on 
      neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of 
      the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, 
      ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and 
      epigenetic markers assessed in saliva. DISCUSSION: Results will reveal the 
      differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental 
      health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The 
      present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, 
      low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, 
      improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of 
      global stressors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered on May 17, 
      2020 with the ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04889508 registration number 
      (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889508).

TI  - Self-Compassion, Health, and Empowerment: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial for 
      Chinese Immigrant Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence.
PG  - 1571-1595
LID - 10.1177/08862605231207624 [doi]
AB  - Chinese immigrant survivors of men's violence experience both significant mental 
      health impacts from abuse and barriers to formal services. Therefore, we examined 
      the preliminary efficacy of an innovative mobile-based empowerment-based 
      intervention (self-compassion, health, and empowerment; SHE) that specifically 
      focuses on abused Chinese immigrant women in the US. This pilot study used a 
      two-arm randomized controlled design with repeated measures. A convenience sample 
      (N = 50) of Chinese immigrant women who experienced past year intimate partner 
      violence (IPV) were recruited online and randomly assigned to the intervention or 
      control group (25 per group). We assessed IPV exposure, safety behaviors, 
      depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      symptoms, and self-compassion at baseline, post-intervention, and 8-week 
      follow-up. Of 95 eligible participants, 50 (52.6%) agreed to participate and 
      completed baseline data collection; intervention completion rate was 64%. We 
      found a significant group and time interaction for self-judgment (a 
      self-compassion component), with a significant reduction seen in the intervention 
      group compared to the control group. Despite no other significant group 
      differences observed over time, the intervention group showed consistent trends 
      toward improvements in most outcome measures, including specific types of IPV 
      (i.e., negotiation, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion), depressive 
      and PTSD symptoms, self-compassion, and certain components of self-compassion 
      (i.e., isolation and over-identification) when compared to the control group. Our 
      findings suggest that the SHE intervention shows promise in improving the mental 
      health well-being of Chinese immigrant survivors. However, a fully powered 
      randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine its efficacy. Our 
      intervention has the potential to be translated in the Chinese immigrant 
      populations with the necessary organizational support.

TI  - Randomized-controlled trial of mindfulness-based cancer recovery versus 
      supportive expressive group therapy among distressed breast cancer survivors 
      (MINDSET): long-term follow-up results.
PG  - 750-9
LID - 10.1002/pon.4150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) and supportive expressive 
      group therapy (SET) are two well-validated psychosocial interventions, but they 
      have not been directly compared, and little is known about long-term outcomes. 
      This comparative effectiveness study measured the effects of these two 
      interventions immediately following the groups and for 1 year thereafter in 
      distressed breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-two distressed 
      Stage I-III breast cancer survivors were randomized into either MBCR or SET. 
      Women completed questionnaires addressing mood, stress symptoms, quality of life, 
      social support, spirituality and post-traumatic growth before and after the 
      interventions, and 6 and 12 months later. RESULTS: Immediately following the 
      intervention, women in MBCR reported greater reduction in mood disturbance 
      (primarily fatigue, anxiety and confusion) and stress symptoms including tension, 
      sympathetic arousal and cognitive symptoms than those in SET. They also reported 
      increased emotional and functional quality of life, emotional, affective and 
      positive social support, spirituality (feelings of peace and meaning in life) and 
      post-traumatic growth (appreciation for life and ability to see new 
      possibilities) relative to those in SET, who also improved to a lesser degree on 
      many outcomes. Effect sizes of the time × group interactions were small to 
      medium, and most benefits were maintained over 12 months of follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first and largest to demonstrate sustained 
      benefits of MBCR in distressed breast cancer survivors relative to an active 
      control. MBCR was superior to SET for improving psychological well-being with 
      lasting benefits over 1 year, suggesting these women gained long-lasting and 
      efficacious tools to cope with cancer. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered on

TI  - Wellbeing Training Based on Contemplative Practices in a Sample of Intensive Care 
      and Homecare Professionals: A Pilot and Feasibility Non-Randomized Clinical 
      Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph192013137 [doi]
LID - 13137
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) and homecare unit professionals are 
      susceptible to higher levels of stress and burnout than other healthcare 
      professionals, which has an impact on their well-being, and in turn on their 
      patients. In terms of data, there is not much research about the effects of 
      psychological interventions on ICU and homecare professionals. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the effectiveness of Wellbeing Training based on 
      Contemplative Practices (WTCP) for the increase of psychological functioning in a 
      sample of ICU and homecare professionals. METHODS: A pilot and feasibility 
      non-randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants in the WTCP group (n = 
      19) attended an at-work 8-session/2 h group WTCP program aimed at directly 
      training four basic skills: (a) sustained positive emotions, (b) recovery from 
      negative emotions, (c) pro-social behavior and generosity, and (d) mind 
      wandering, mindfulness, and "affective stickiness". Nineteen professionals were 
      allocated in the control group. RESULTS: Results indicated that WTCP had a 
      positive impact on self-compassion, personal accomplishment (burnout), and 
      frequency of negative emotions. Moreover, a thematic analysis of participant 
      interviews (n = 14) was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are 
      promising, though future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of WTCP 
      using randomized controlled trial methodologies.

TI  - Efficacy of the Mental Health App "Intellect" to Improve Body Image and 
      Self-compassion in Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial With a 4-Week 
      Follow-up.
PG  - e41800
LID - 10.2196/41800 [doi]
LID - e41800
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body image concerns are prevalent among young adults, who may be 
      vulnerable to developing body image concerns because of particular risk factors 
      associated with this life period. With technological advancements, digital mobile 
      health (mHealth) apps are cost-effective and scalable interventions. Thus, 
      mHealth apps can be explored as a form of prevention effort to alleviate body 
      image concerns in young adults. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, 
      we examined the effectiveness of a self-guided mHealth app in improving body 
      image and self-compassion in a sample of university students. METHODS: 
      Participants (N=310) were randomized to a 9-day self-guided body image and 
      self-compassion mHealth app (n=149) and to an active waitlist control group 
      (n=161), where they completed a similarly structured 9-day program on 
      cooperation. Both programs consisted of content learning and activities such as 
      quizzes, with the number and length of activities matched for both programs. 
      Measures were obtained at baseline, upon completion of the programs (after the 
      intervention), and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention group for 
      female participants reported significant reduction in body dissatisfaction 
      (P<.001) and improvements in body appreciation (P<.001) and self-compassion 
      (P=.001) compared with the active waitlist control group after the intervention. 
      Similarly, for male participants after the intervention, a significant reduction 
      was found in the intervention group in body dissatisfaction (P<.001) after the 
      intervention as well as improvements in body appreciation (P=.02) and 
      self-compassion (P=.047). The effects were maintained at 4-week follow-up for 
      female participants on body dissatisfaction (P<.001), body appreciation (P<.001), 
      and self-compassion (P=.02) but not for male participants. On body image risk 
      factors, significant reductions were found for female participants after the 
      intervention for thin-ideal internalization (P<.001), peer pressure (P=.002), and 
      media pressure (P<.001) after the intervention, while the effects were only 
      maintained for thin-ideal internalization (P=.008) and media pressure (P=.01) at 
      4-week follow-up, compared with the active waitlist control group. As for male 
      participants, no intervention effects were found both after the intervention and 
      at follow-up for all body image risk factors of muscularity internalization, peer 
      pressure, and media pressure. Both apps were acceptable and participants engaged 
      equally across the intervention and active waitlist control groups, as indicated 
      on a measure of app engagement (P=.76). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 
      preliminary evidence for a self-guided mHealth app in improving body image 
      concerns and self-compassion in young adult university students. Future studies 
      should include longer follow-ups, and examine its effects with the wider 
      populations of young adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04977973;

TI  - Towards a mechanistic understanding of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) 
      using an RCT neuroimaging approach: Effects on regulating own stress in social 
      and non-social situations.

AB  - Although much research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can 
      reduce psychological stress, it is less clear if effects generalize to everyday 
      social situations, which range among the largest stress triggers. Furthermore, 
      mechanisms of MBIs have not been fully established. Emotion regulation (ER) has 
      been suggested as one key mechanism, yet the role of cognitive reappraisal and 
      acceptance strategies is still under debate. To address these questions, a 
      neuroimaging-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed (n=68), 
      comparing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with a reading/listening 
      intervention (READ), using a novel dyadic paradigm for self and other emotion 
      regulation under stress as primary outcome on behavior and brain levels and 
      established empathy measures (clinicatrials.gov NCT03035669). Compared to READ, 
      MBSR led to self-reported stress reduction through both cognitive reappraisal and 
      acceptance only when regulating self and not when regulating others' distress. In 
      addition, MBSR led to increased brain activation over time for regulating own 
      (parietal cortex) and others' (precuneus, TPJ) emotions through cognitive 
      reappraisal and acceptance, albeit this effect was also seen for the reading 
      intervention for regulating own stress via reappraisal. Brain changes did not 
      scale with subjective stress reduction and amount of meditation practice. More 
      distant generalization effects of MBSR on socio-emotional functioning (cognitive 
      empathy and compassion) could also not be shown. This study identified both 
      cognitive reappraisal and acceptance as two ER mechanisms of MBSR, but indicates 
      that effects do not extend to social settings.

TI  - Loving-kindness meditation for chronic low back pain: results from a pilot trial.
PG  - 287-304
AB  - PURPOSE: Loving-kindness meditation has been used for centuries in the Buddhist 
      tradition to develop love and transform anger into compassion. This pilot study 
      tested an 8-week loving-kindness program for chronic low back pain patients. 
      METHOD: Patients (N = 43) were randomly assigned to the intervention or standard 
      care. Standardized measures assessed patients' pain, anger, and psychological 
      distress. FINDINGS: Post and follow-up analyses showed significant improvements 
      in pain and psychological distress in the loving-kindness group, but no changes 
      in the usual care group. Multilevel analyses of daily data showed that more 
      loving-kindness practice on a given day was related to lower pain that day and 
      lower anger the next day. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results suggest that the 
      loving-kindness program can be beneficial in reducing pain, anger, and 
      psychological distress in patients with persistent low back pain. IMPLICATIONS: 
      Clinicians may find loving-kindness meditation helpful in the treatment of 
      patients with persistent pain.

TI  - A preliminary investigation of yoga as an intervention approach for improving 
      long-term weight loss: A randomized trial.
PG  - e0263405

LID - e0263405
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Yoga targets psychological processes which may be important for 
      long-term weight loss (WL). This study is the first to examine the feasibility, 
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of yoga within a weight management 
      program following WL treatment. METHODS: 60 women with overweight or obesity 
      (34.3±3.9 kg/m2, 48.1±10.1 years) were randomized to receive a 12-week yoga 
      intervention (2x/week; YOGA) or a structurally equivalent control 
      (cooking/nutrition classes; CON), following a 3-month behavioral WL program. 
      Feasibility (attendance, adherence, retention) and acceptability (program 
      satisfaction ratings) were assessed. Treatment groups were compared on weight 
      change, mindfulness, distress tolerance, stress, affect, and self-compassion at 6 
      months. Initial WL (3-mo WL) was evaluated as a potential moderator. RESULTS: 
      Attendance, retention, and program satisfaction ratings of yoga were high. 
      Treatment groups did not differ on WL or psychological constructs (with exception 
      of one mindfulness subscale) at 6 months. However, among those with high initial 
      WL (≥5%), YOGA lost significantly more weight (-9.0kg vs. -6.7kg) at 6 months and 
      resulted in greater distress tolerance, mindfulness, and self-compassion and 
      lower negative affect, compared to CON. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings provide 
      preliminary support for yoga as a potential strategy for improving long-term WL 
      among those losing ≥5% in standard behavioral treatment.

AB  - This study compared the effectiveness of two proprioceptive exercise programs for 
      persons diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty-three patients with mild 
      to moderate PD were randomly assigned to a yoga meditation program (YoMed) or to 
      an established proprioceptive training program (PRO). Both interventions included 
      twice weekly sessions (45 minutes each), spanning a 12-week period. Outcome 
      measures included: joint position sense (JPS(45)°, JPS(55)°, JPS(65)°) and joint 
      kinesthesia (JK(Flex) and JK(Ext)), the Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool (TIN), 
      Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), dynamic 
      posturography (DMA and TIME) and the Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG). Test 
      administrators were blinded to group affiliation. Significant between-group 
      differences favoring the YoMed group were observed for TIN (p = 0.01, d = 0.77) 
      and JK(Flex) (p = 0.05, d = -0.72). DMA and TIME scores significantly improved 
      for both groups, and no adverse events were reported. These findings indicate 
      that the YoMed program is safe and effective for patients with PD. Researchers 
      should continue to examine the clinical efficacy of mind-body techniques to 
      improve movement control and body awareness in this population.

TI  - Online self-compassion training to improve the wellbeing of youth with chronic 
      medical conditions: protocol for a randomised control trial.
PG  - 106

LID - 106
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic medical conditions (CMCs) affect up to 35% of children and 
      adolescents. Youth with chronic medical conditions are at an increased risk of 
      psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life, and report 
      rates of mental illness up to double that of their physically healthy peers. 
      Accessible, evidence-based interventions for young people with chronic illness 
      are urgently required to improve their mental health and daily functioning. 
      Self-compassion involves taking a mindful, accepting approach to difficult 
      experiences, being aware that one is not alone in one's suffering, and being kind 
      and understanding with oneself during challenging times. Self-compassion shares 
      strong associations with mental health outcomes among young people and 
      preliminary work indicates that interventions that build self-compassion have the 
      potential to substantially improve youth mental health. Self-compassion is also 
      associated with better physical and mental health outcomes among individuals 
      living with CMCs. While face-to-face self-compassion training is available, there 
      are several barriers to access for youth with CMCs. Online self-compassion 
      training potentially offers an accessible alternative for this high-risk group. 
      METHODS: Self-Compassion Online (SCO) is a self-compassion program that has been 
      tested with a non-clinical adult group. For the proposed trial, a reference group 
      of youth (16-25 years) with chronic illness reviewed the program and proposed 
      adaptations to improve its suitability for youth with chronic illness. In 
      alignment with the SPIRIT Checklist, this paper outlines the protocol for a 
      CONSORT-compliant, single-blind randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy 
      of the adapted program, relative to a waitlist control, for improving 
      self-compassion, wellbeing, distress, emotion regulation, coping and quality of 
      life among young Australians with CMCs. Mechanisms of action and feasibility of 
      SCO will be analysed using quantitative data and participant interviews, 
      respectively. Finally, cost-utility will be analysed using health-related quality 
      of life data. DISCUSSION: The SCO program could provide a scalable solution for 
      improving psychological outcomes and quality of life among youth with chronic 
      illness. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for 
      improving these outcomes, relative to waitlist control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The 
      trial was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on 
      the 11th April 2019, ACTRN12619000572167. Protocol version: Version 2, 21 
      December 2019.

PG  - 349-357
LID - 10.1136/postgradmedj-2019-137413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Junior doctors are frequently exposed to occupational and traumatic 
      stress, sometimes with tragic consequences. Mindfulness-based and fitness 
      interventions are increasingly used to mitigate this, but have not been 
      compared.We conducted a randomised, controlled pilot trial to assess the 
      feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of these interventions in junior 
      doctors. METHODS: We randomised participants (n=21) to weekly 1-hour sessions of 
      personalised, trauma-informed yoga (n=10), with a 4-hour workshop, and eHealth 
      homework; or group-format fitness (n=8) in an existing wellness programme, MDOK. 
      Burnout, traumatic stress and suicidality were measured at baseline and 8 weeks. 
      RESULTS: Both interventions reduced burnout, and yoga increased compassion 
      satisfaction within group on the Professional Quality of Life scale, without 
      difference between groups on this measure.Personalised yoga significantly reduced 
      depersonalisation (z=-1.99, p=0.05) compared with group fitness on the Maslach 
      Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS (MP)) and showed greater flexibility changes. Both 
      interventions increased MBI Personal Accomplishment, with no changes in other 
      self-report psychological or physiological metrics, including 
      breath-counting.Participants doing one-to-one yoga rated it more highly overall 
      (p=0.02) than group fitness, and reported it comparatively more beneficial for 
      mental (p=0.01) and physical health (p=0.05). Face-to-face weekly sessions were 
      100% attended in yoga, but only 45% in fitness. CONCLUSION: In this pilot trial, 
      both yoga and fitness improved burnout, but trauma-informed yoga reduced 
      depersonalisation in junior doctors more than group-format fitness. One-to-one 
      yoga was better adhered than fitness, but was more resource intensive. Junior 
      doctors need larger-scale comparative research of the effectiveness and 
      implementation of individual, organisational and systemic mental health 
      interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ANZCTR 12618001467224.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated anxiety and related symptoms among the 
      general population. In order to cope with the mental health burden, we developed 
      an online brief modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (mMBSR) therapy. We 
      performed a parallel-group randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy 
      of the mMBSR for adult anxiety with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as an 
      active control. Participants were randomized to mMBSR, CBT or waitlist group. 
      Those in the intervention arms performed each therapy for 6 sections in 3 weeks. 
      Measurements were conducted at baseline, post-treatment and 6 months 
      post-treatment by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-15, reverse scored Cohen Perceived Stress scale, 
      Insomnia Severity Index, and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. 150 participants 
      with anxiety symptoms were randomized to mMBSR, CBT or waitlist group. Post 
      intervention assessments showed that mMBSR improved the scores of all the six 
      mental problem dimensions (anxiety, depression, somatization, stress, insomnia, 
      and the experience of pleasure) significantly compared to the waitlist group. 
      During 6-month post treatment assessment, the scores of all six mental problem 
      dimensions in the mMBSR group still showed improvement compared to baseline and 
      showed no significant difference with the CBT group. Our results provide positive 
      evidence for the efficacy and feasibility of an online brief modified MBSR 
      program to alleviate anxiety and related symptoms of individuals from the general 
      population, and the therapeutic benefits of mMBSR persisted for up to six months. 
      This low resource-consuming intervention could facilitate the challenges of 
      supplying psychological health therapy to large scale of population.

TI  - Engaging Patients in Research That Involves Meditation: Religious Concerns and 
      Nursing Implications.
PG  - E828-E834
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0000000000001046 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the use of meditative practices for supporting 
      symptom management among patients undergoing cancer treatment have increased 
      substantially in recent years. Although meditative practices as adjuncts to 
      promoting health have become mainstream, concerns that such strategies conflict 
      with traditional religious tenets have co-occurred. In the context of a 12-week 
      sequential multiple assignment randomized trial of home-based meditative 
      practices and reflexology delivered to patients with cancer by or with family 
      caregivers to manage symptoms, early attrition was identified in the meditative 
      practices arm. OBJECTIVE: Finding religious concerns were factors contributing to 
      attrition; the purpose is to describe adjustments to the training protocol for 
      study recruiters and interveners when enrolling participants and teaching 
      patient-caregiver dyads meditative practices. METHODS: The training protocol for 
      recruiters and interveners was adapted to address religious concerns related to 
      meditative practices. RESULTS: Since initiation, recruiters and interveners have 
      appreciated the adapted protocol, which has improved their capacity to respond to 
      religious concerns. Participants have responded well to consideration of the 
      practices as mindful movements coordinated with breath. CONCLUSIONS: Given 
      broader application of meditation in symptom management studies, researchers will 
      need to be ready to address religious concerns. It is essential that protocols 
      for introducing meditation are broadly presented to respond to concerns of 
      patients and cancer caregivers regarding perceived conflicts with their specific 
      religious beliefs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As the provision of integrative 
      care options that include meditation training for patients grows, nurses require 
      awareness of potential barriers and strategies to ameliorate religious concerns.

AB  - When evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on the 
      stress response, several aspects should be considered, such as (1) effects on 
      various response systems, (2) temporal dynamics of the stress response, and (3) 
      differences between programs. This study assesses the stress-attenuating effects 
      of a standard mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and a second-generation 
      MBI: MBSR with elements of other Buddhist practices (MBSR-B). Ninety-nine healthy 
      volunteers were randomly assigned to the MBSR, MBSR-B, or waitlist control groups 
      and their stress response was evaluated with the Trier Social Stress Test. 
      Changes in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, 
      sympathoadrenomedullary system, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and affect 
      were measured during distinct phases of the task. Compared to waitlist control, 
      the stress-attenuated effects of MBIs were detected across almost all systems and 
      both negative and positive affect. In the parasympathetic branch of the ANS, the 
      effect of MBIs was present in all stress phases (however, in the recovery phase, 
      only MBSR-B has shown a statistically significant effect in comparison with the 
      waitlist control). The stress-attenuating effects of MBIs were observed already 
      in the anticipatory phase for cortisol, ANS, and negative affect (for negative 
      affect, only the modified MBSR-B program has shown statistically significant 
      effect in comparison with the waitlist control).

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an enduring pattern of 
      instability across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal domains. 
      Individuals with BPD are known to be particularly vulnerable to experiences of 
      social rejection, but little work has examined strategies that may moderate their 
      reactivity to social rejection. Using a laboratory experimental approach, this 
      study investigated the effects of brief mindfulness and loving-kindness 
      meditation (LKM) inductions on emotional and behavioral responses to social 
      rejection in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. One hundred and eighteen 
      participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 min of mindful breathing 
      practice, LKM, or a no-instruction control condition, prior to exposure to a 
      social rejection manipulation. Participants rated their emotions and completed a 
      competitive reaction time task, which provided a proxy measure of aggression. 
      Compared to the control condition, the mindfulness group demonstrated 
      significantly quicker recovery in negative affect and feelings of rejection after 
      social rejection. The mindfulness group also reported significantly quicker 
      recovery in negative affect compared to the LKM group. Whereas baseline trait 
      mindfulness negatively predicted aggressive behaviors across all participants, 
      groups did not differ in immediate emotional reactivity or aggressive behavior 
      following social rejection. The findings suggest that mindfulness training may be 
      a promising strategy in alleviating negative emotional effects of social 
      rejection among individuals with high borderline personality traits, and 
      highlight the limited utility of brief LKM practice in buffering the effects of 
      social rejection.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion Smartphone Intervention for Worker Mental Health in 
      Japan: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e53541
LID - 10.2196/53541 [doi]
LID - e53541
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health problems among workers cause enormous losses to 
      companies in Japan. However, workers have been considered to have limited access 
      to psychological support because of time constraints, which makes it difficult 
      for them to engage in face-to-face psychological support interventions. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present an intervention protocol that describes a 
      randomized controlled trial to examine whether brief guided mindfulness 
      meditation (MM) or self-compassion meditation (SCM) provided by a smartphone app 
      is effective for mental health and work-related outcomes among workers. METHODS: 
      This is an open-label, 3-arm randomized controlled trial. The participants will 
      be recruited through an open call on relevant websites with the following 
      inclusion criteria: (1) employees who are working more than 20 hours per week, 
      (2) between the ages of 18 and 54 years, (3) not on a leave of absence, (4) not 
      business owners or students, and (5) not currently diagnosed with a mental 
      disorder and have a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6 score below 13 points. 
      We will include 200 participants and randomly assign them to an SCM course 
      (n=67), an MM course (n=67), and a waitlist group (n=66). The intervention groups 
      (SCM and MM) will be instructed to engage in daily guided self-help, 
      self-compassion, and MMs lasting 6-12 minutes per day over 4 weeks. Primary 
      outcomes will include psychological distress and job performance, and secondary 
      outcomes will include somatic symptoms, cognitive flexibility, self-esteem, 
      self-compassion, perceived stress, well-being, emotion regulation, work 
      engagement, anger, psychological safety, and creativity. All procedures were 
      approved by the ethics committee of the University of Tokyo (22-326). All 
      participants will be informed of the study via the websites, and written informed 
      consent will be collected via web-based forms. RESULTS: The recruitment of 
      participants began in December 2022, and the intervention began in January 2023. 
      As of September 2023, a total of 375 participants have been enrolled. The 
      intervention and data collection were completed in late October 2023. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the development of effective self-care 
      intervention content that will improve mental health, work performance, and 
      related outcomes and promote mindful and self-compassionate attitudes when faced 
      with distress. TRIAL REGISTRATION: University Hospital Medical Information

TI  - Participant experiences of change in mindfulness-based stress reduction for 
      anxiety disorders.
PG  - 1776094
LID - 10.1080/17482631.2020.1776094 [doi]
LID - 1776094
AB  - AIM: To explore experiences of change among participants in a randomized clinical 
      trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for anxiety disorders. METHOD: 
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the subjective experiences 
      of change for individuals with anxiety disorders after a course in MBSR. 
      Interviews were analysed employing hermeneutic-phenomenological thematic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Five main themes were identified: 1) Something useful to do 
      when anxiety appears, 2) Feeling more at ease, 3) Doing things my anxiety 
      wouldn't let me, 4) Meeting what is there, and 5) Better-but not there yet. Most 
      participants used what they had learned for instrumental purposes, and described 
      relief from anxiety and an increased sense of personal agency. A few reported 
      more radical acceptance of anxiety, as well as increased self-compassion. 
      CONCLUSION: Participants of MBSR both describe mindfulness as a tool to "fix" 
      anxiety and as bringing about more fundamental change towards acceptance of their 
      anxiety. The complexity of reported change corresponds with better handling of 
      areas representing known transdiagnostic features of anxiety disorder, such as 
      dysfunctional cognitive processes (including attentional biases), emotional 
      dysregulation, avoidance behaviours, and maladaptive self-relatedness. This 
      supports MBSR as a transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of anxiety 
      disorders.

      on Emotional Distress under Stressful Conditions: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 762-775
LID - 10.3390/ejihpe13040058 [doi]
AB  - Intervention programs based on self-compassion have demonstrated their efficacy 
      both in reducing psychological distress and increasing well-being. The goal of 
      this study was to test the efficacy of an online intervention to increase 
      mindfulness and self-compassion levels in a non-clinical sample in a highly 
      stressful context: the ten weeks of lockdown imposed in the early stages of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention sessions consisted of thirty-minute guided 
      meditations followed by thirty minutes of inquiry. Sixty-one participants 
      completed two thirds of the sessions or more, and 65 individuals participated in 
      a waiting-list (WL) control group. Self-compassion, anxiety, depression and 
      stress levels were assessed. The analysis of pre-post results suggests that the 
      interventions increased self-compassion levels and decreased anxiety, depression 
      and stress levels, whereas the WL group did not show any significant changes. The 
      emotional changes in the intervention group were associated with the increase in 
      self-compassion. However, at follow-up, the scores of emotional distress 
      variables returned to the initial pre-intervention scores. These data can be 
      interpreted in line with previous results that have shown the efficacy of 
      self-compassion-based intervention programs. Given that this efficacy was not 
      maintained at follow-up, data are discussed according to the pervasive role of a 
      highly stressful context and-as described in other studies-the need for regular 
      practice to maintain the benefits obtained.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Mindful Compassion Care Program in reducing burnout and 
      psychological distress amongst frontline hospital nurses during the COVID-19

PG  - 734
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06666-2 [doi]
LID - 734
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that nurses have been more affected by the 
      COVID-19 pandemic than any other group of hospital workers in terms of anxiety, 
      depression, and burnout. Several clinical studies had previously demonstrated the 
      effectiveness of mindfulness and compassion interventions in reducing burnout and 
      emotional distress amongst healthcare professionals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A 
      parallel-group randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility, 
      acceptability, and efficacy of a mindfulness and compassion-focused programme on 
      frontline nurses who had been working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-two 
      participants will be recruited from Verona University Hospital Trust (Veneto 
      Region, north-east Italy) and will be divided equally into an intervention group 
      and a control group. Primary outcome will be assessed using the Emotional 
      Exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS). 
      Secondary outcomes will be measured by the Cynicism and Professional Efficacy 
      subscales of the MBI-GS, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the 
      Impact of Stressful Events (IES-R), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Five 
      Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Forms of 
      Self-Criticising/attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale (FSCRS). DISCUSSION: The 
      study aims to fill a gap in the literature and present a scientifically validated 
      intervention for those healthcare professionals most exposed to the stressful 
      conditions of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT05308537.

TI  - Pathways to mental well-being for graduates of mindfulness-based cognitive

      analysis of an RCT.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore mediated effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
      Therapy-"Taking it Further" (MBCT-TiF) on mental well-being through changes in 
      mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering. METHOD: A secondary analysis of an 
      RCT using simple mediation, with 164 graduates of MBCT and mindfulness-based 
      stress reduction (MBSR), was implemented whereby MBCT-TiF (vs ongoing mindfulness 
      practice; OMP) was the independent variable; changes in mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and decentering during the intervention were the mediators; and 
      mental well-being at post-intervention, whilst controlling for baseline, was the 
      dependent variable. Secondary outcomes included psychological quality of life, 
      depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Compared to OMP, MBCT-TiF experienced 
      significant improvements in mental well-being through changes in all three 
      mediators (mindfulness: ab = 0.11 [0.03, 0.25]; decentering: ab = 0.16 [0.05, 
      0.33]; self-compassion: ab = 0.07 [0.01, 0.18]). A similar pattern was 
      demonstrated for depression, but only mindfulness and decentering mediated 
      effects on psychological quality of life and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The findings 
      provide preliminary support for all three mediators in driving change in mental 
      well-being in a sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates. Future work must be theory-driven 
      and powered to test all mediators in parallel and alongside other potential 
      mediators (e.g., equanimity) to further understand independent contributions and 
      interacting effects.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

TI  - A Web-Based, Mindful, and Compassionate Parenting Training for Mothers 
      Experiencing Parenting Stress: Results from a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial 
      of the Mindful Moment Program.
PG  - 3091-3108
LID - 10.1007/s12671-022-02016-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mindful Moment is a self-guided, web-based, mindful, and 
      compassionate parenting training for postpartum mothers who experience parenting 
      stress. We aimed to assess Mindful Moment's feasibility, acceptability, and 
      usability, and to gather preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in reducing 
      parenting stress and outcomes such as mindful parenting, self-compassion, 
      depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, dispositional mindfulness, mother's 
      perception of infant temperament, and mother-infant bonding. METHODS: This pilot 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) was a two-arm trial and followed the CONSORT 
      2010, CONSORT-EHEALTH, and CONSORT-SPI 2018 extension guidelines. A total of 292 
      Portuguese mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 146) or 
      to the waiting list control group (n = 146) and completed baseline (T1) and 
      postintervention (T2) self-reported assessments. RESULTS: A total of 31 mothers 
      (21.23%) completed the Mindful Moment intervention. Most mothers evaluated the 
      program as good or excellent (90%), considered that Mindful Moment provided them 
      the kind of help they expected or wanted (61%), were satisfied with the help 
      provided by the program (74.6%), would recommend it to a friend in a similar 
      situation (86.4%), and would use it again if needed (81.4%). Regarding the 
      program's preliminary effectiveness, mothers in the intervention group presented 
      a greater decrease in parenting stress, a greater increase in dispositional 
      mindfulness, and a greater decrease in their perception of the difficult 
      temperament of their infants from T1 to T2. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 
      preliminary evidence of the Mindful Moment's effectiveness and suggests that it 
      is a feasible and acceptable program for postpartum mothers experiencing 
      parenting stress. Further research is needed to confirm these results in a larger 
      RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04892082).

      Unit-Based Nurse Leaders: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20116035 [doi]
LID - 6035
AB  - This randomized controlled trial examined the impact of a psychoeducational group 
      program on the mental well-being of unit-based nurse leaders, specifically nurse 
      managers and assistant nurse managers. The program was developed around the 
      themes of resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment to fight burnout 
      and enhance purposeful adaptive coping to reduce distress and improve mental 
      wellbeing. The sample included 77 unit-based nurse leaders. Outcomes included 
      post-traumatic growth, resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, 
      perceived stress, burnout, and job satisfaction. Paired samples t-tests and 
      repeated measures ANOVA tests were conducted to compare outcomes at baseline to 
      the follow-up timepoints of endpoint, one-month follow-up, three-month follow-up, 
      and six-month follow-up. The intervention group participants showed significant 
      improvement in post-traumatic growth between baseline and all follow-up 
      timepoints compared to the waitlist control group. Among intervention group 
      participants, there were also significant improvements in self-reflection and 
      insight, self-compassion, psychological empowerment, and compassion satisfaction, 
      as well as significant reductions in perceived stress, burnout, and secondary 
      traumatic stress. This study extends existing evidence that this 
      psychoeducational group program can be an effective intervention for improving 
      and protecting mental wellbeing. Among nurse leaders, it can reduce stress and 
      burnout and improve post-traumatic growth, self-reflection and insight, 
      self-compassion, psychological empowerment, and compassion satisfaction.

TI  - Comparing self-compassion versus body exposure for adult women with moderate to 
      severe body dissatisfaction: A feasibility and pilot trial.
PG  - 1475-1480
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2724 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of two brief online 
      interventions for body shame for women with moderate to severe negative body 
      image, to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial. The primary 
      feasibility outcomes were recruitment, measure completion rates, retention rates 
      and internet connection failure rates. The secondary pilot outcomes were change 
      on clinical measures and state shame ratings during the interventions. 
      Participants were randomized to either online (40-min single session) body 
      exposure or self-compassion interventions. Five validated nomothetic outcome 
      measures (body dissatisfaction, appreciation, eating disorder, external shame and 
      anxiety) were taken at three time points (preintervention, postintervention and 
      2-week follow-up). Subjective units of body shame (SUBS 0-100 scale) were rated 
      every 5 min during the interventions. The target of recruiting 30 participants in 
      60 days was successfully achieved. The measure completion rate was high (100%), 
      and retention rates (80% to 100%) showed moderate-to-high acceptability of the 
      interventions. Online delivery was moderately viable with a 12.5% session 
      disconnection rate. The self-compassion intervention significantly reduced SUBS 
      ratings during the course of the intervention, but there was no significant 
      improvement or difference between the interventions on nomothetic outcome 
      measures. Findings suggest that a fully powered trial is viable, and sample size 
      calculation and methodological requirements are provided.

AB  - Over the past fifteen years, positive psychology research has validated a set of 
      happiness enhancing techniques. These techniques are relatively simple exercises 
      that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy 
      people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has 
      shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, 
      practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions 
      that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed 
      and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program - PER 
      program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a 
      theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the 
      effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to 
      existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 
      6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation 
      training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer 
      participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness 
      Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant 
      increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant 
      decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls. Our 
      results suggest that the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation can be an 
      effective option to organize and deliver positive integrative interventions.

TI  - An 18-month meditation training selectively improves psychological well-being in 
      older adults: A secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As the world population is ageing, it is vital to understand how 
      older adults can maintain and deepen their psychological well-being as they are 
      confronted with the unique challenges of ageing in a complex world. Theoretical 
      work has highlighted the promising role of intentional mental training such as 
      meditation practice for enhancing human flourishing. However, meditation-based 
      randomised controlled trials in older adults are lacking. We aimed to investigate 
      the effects of meditation training on psychological well-being in older adults. 
      METHODS: This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02977819), which randomised 137 healthy older adults (age 
      range: 65 to 84 years) to an 18-month meditation training, an active comparator 
      (English language training), or a passive control. Well-being was measured at 
      baseline, mid-intervention, and 18-month post-randomisation using the 
      Psychological Well-being Scale (PWBS), the World Health Organisation's Quality of 
      Life (QoL) Assessment psychological subscale, and composite scores reflecting the 
      meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, insight, and a 
      global score comprising the average of these meditation-based dimensions. 
      RESULTS: The 18-month meditation training was superior to English training on 
      changes in the global score (0.54 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.82], p = 0.0002) and the 
      subscales of awareness, connection, insight, and superior to no-intervention only 
      on changes in the global score (0.54 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.82], p = 0.0002) and 
      awareness. Between-group differences in psychological QoL in favour of meditation 
      did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. There were 
      no between-group differences in PWBS total score. Within the meditation group, 
      psychological QoL, awareness, insight, and the global score increased 
      significantly from baseline to 18-month post-randomisation. CONCLUSION: The 
      longest randomised meditation training conducted to date enhanced a global 
      composite score reflecting the meditation-based well-being dimensions of 
      awareness, connection, and insight in older adults. Future research is needed to 
      delineate the cognitive, affective, and behavioural factors that predict 
      responsiveness to meditation and thus help refine the development of tailored 
      meditation training.

TI  - Investigating efficacy of two brief mind-body intervention programs for managing 
      sleep disturbance in cancer survivors: a pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 165-82
LID - 10.1007/s11764-012-0252-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: After completing treatment, cancer survivors may suffer from a multitude 
      of physical and mental health impairments, resulting in compromised quality of 
      life. This exploratory study investigated whether two mind-body interventions, 
      i.e., Mind-Body Bridging (MBB) and Mindfulness Meditation (MM), could improve 
      posttreatment cancer survivors' self-reported sleep disturbance and comorbid 
      symptoms, as compared to sleep hygiene education (SHE) as an active control. 
      METHODS: This randomized controlled trial examined 57 cancer survivors with 
      clinically significant self-reported sleep disturbance, randomly assigned to 
      receive MBB, MM, or SHE. All interventions were conducted in three sessions, once 
      per week. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed via the Medical Outcomes Study 
      Sleep Scale and other indicators of psychosocial functioning relevant to quality 
      of life, stress, depression, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. 
      RESULTS: Mixed effects model analysis revealed that mean sleep disturbance 
      symptoms in the MBB (p = .0029) and MM (p = .0499) groups were lower than in the 
      SHE group, indicating that both mind-body interventions improved sleep. In 
      addition, compared with the SHE group, the MBB group showed reductions in 
      self-reported depression symptoms (p = .040) and improvements in overall levels 
      of mindfulness (p = .018), self-compassion (p = .028), and well-being (p = .019) 
      at postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that 
      brief sleep-focused MBB and MM are promising interventions for sleep disturbance 
      in cancer survivors. Integrating MBB or MM into posttreatment supportive plans 
      should enhance care of cancer survivors with sleep disturbance. Because MBB 
      produced additional secondary benefits, MBB may serve as a promising multipurpose 
      intervention for posttreatment cancer survivors suffering from sleep disturbance 
      and other comorbid symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Two brief 
      sleep-focused mind-body interventions investigated in the study were effective in 
      reducing sleep disturbance and one of them further improved other psychosocial 
      aspects of the cancer survivors' life. Management of sleep problems in survivors 
      is a high priority issue that demands more attention in cancer survivorship.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to have psychological 
      benefits in college students. We explored the effects of an academic Seminar on 
      Compassion on student psychological health. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one participants 
      (14 male, 27 female, mean age 19.8 ± 1.4 years) were assessed pre- and post- 
      spring semesters 2013 and 2014. METHODS: Students were randomized to the Seminar 
      on Compassion or a wait-list control group. Participants completed self-report 
      measures on anxiety, depression, perceived stress, self-compassion, compassion 
      and mindfulness. Salivary alpha-amylase was also assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, 
      self-compassion and mindfulness were negatively correlated with depression, 
      anxiety, and perceived stress. There were significant changes between the 
      intervention and control group from Time 1 to Time 2 in mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, compassion, and salivary alpha-amylase; however, there were no 
      significant changes in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The course was effective in increasing mindfulness, self-compassion and 
      compassion, and decreasing a salivary marker of stress.

      meditation in an open setting associating people with cancer (target population), 
      medical staff and witnesses (neither patient nor medical staff). This study aims 
      (1) to evaluate the effects of meditation on wellness improvement and (2) to 
      identify criteria and modalities for a subsequent randomised study. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: We propose a longitudinal pilot study consisting of a non-randomised 
      experimental preintervention/postintervention survey. The intervention consists 
      in delivering a meditation programme (12 weekly meditation sessions of 1.5 hours 
      each), specifically adapted to our target population and addressing our research 
      hypothesis in an open setting involving people with cancer, medical staff and 
      witnesses (equally distributed in two groups of 15 participants). The main 
      objective is to evaluate participants' adherence to the programme. The effects of 
      meditation will be evaluated on stress, quality of life, feeling of personal 
      effectiveness, on the development of mindfulness and empathy, and on satisfaction 
      and perception of a change in quality of life. We will also measure the putative 
      added value of 'meditating together'. This study is expected to allow validating 
      the evaluation tools and refining the modalities of the workshops. We expect to 
      demonstrate the evolution that this meditation-based intervention induces in the 
      participants. We aim to promote bridge-building, between patients, medical staff 
      but also others. In this way, one's own suffering may be understood in the light 
      of others' suffering, thereby promoting the sense of otherness and giving 
      insights into 'living better with'. This exploratory study will investigate the 
      relevance of this hypothesis, which could then be explored by a randomised study. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee 
      (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est II). Trial findings will be published in 
      peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04410185.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depression is a common psychiatric disorder, frequently taking 
      a chronic course. Despite provision of evidence-based treatments, including 
      antidepressant medication and psychological treatments like cognitive behavioral 
      therapy or interpersonal therapy, a substantial amount of patients do not 
      recover. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been found to be 
      effective in reducing relapse in recurrent depression, as well as lowering 
      symptom levels in acute depression. The effectiveness of MBCT for chronic, 
      treatment-resistant depression has only be studied in a few pilot trials. A large 
      randomized controlled trial is necessary to examine the effectiveness of MBCT in 
      reducing depressive symptoms in chronic, treatment-resistant depression. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized-controlled trial is conducted to compare MBCT with 
      treatment-as-usual (TAU). Patients with chronic, treatment-resistant depression 
      who have received antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy or 
      interpersonal therapy are included. Assessments take place at baseline and post 
      intervention/TAU-period. The primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary 
      outcomes are: remission rates, quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills 
      and self-compassion. Patients in the TAU condition are offered to participate in 
      the MBCT after the post TAU-period assessment. From all completers of the MBCT 
      (MBCT condition and patients participating after the TAU-period), follow-up 
      assessments are taken at three and six months after the completion of the MBCT. 
      DISCUSSION: This trial will result in valuable information about the 
      effectiveness of MBCT in chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients who 
      previously received antidepressant medication and psychological treatment. TRIAL

TI  - The Impact of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Compassion Fatigue of Nurses Working 
      in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A Randomized Clinical Trial Study.
PG  - 215-222
LID - 10.1097/HNP.0000000000000590 [doi]
AB  - Compassion fatigue is a common complication in nurses, which can lead to burnout, 
      job dissatisfaction, and a decline in the quality of patient care. This study 
      aimed to investigate the impact of loving-kindness meditation on compassion 
      fatigue of nurses working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This 
      cluster-blinded randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 66 NICU nurses 
      in 2 educational hospitals selected. The intervention group received a 1-month 
      online program for daily training and practice of loving-kindness meditation. The 
      control group received miscellaneous files on mental health during the COVID-19 
      pandemic period. The Nursing Compassion Fatigue Inventory (NCFI) was filled out 
      by the 2 groups, before and after the intervention. The results showed that the 
      mean scores of the NCFI in the intervention group decreased significantly 
      compared with before the intervention (P = .002). In comparison with the control 
      group, there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the 2 groups 
      after the intervention (P = .034). Among nurses working in NICU, loving-kindness 
      meditation significantly reduces compassion fatigue after 1 month. These findings 
      support the use of this intervention for nurses.

TI  - Primary care-based mindfulness intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder and 
      depression symptoms among Black adults: A pilot feasibility and acceptability 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 858-867
LID - 10.1037/tra0001390 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is support for the use of mindfulness-based approaches with 
      trauma-exposed adults. However, limited data are available on feasibility and 
      acceptability of group-based mindfulness interventions in urban medical clinics 
      serving primarily Black adults with low socioeconomic resources, where rates of 
      trauma exposure are high. The present randomized pilot study evaluated the 
      feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week adapted mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (MBCT) group for trauma-exposed Black adults who screened positive for 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in an urban primary care 
      clinic setting. METHOD: Participants were randomized to waitlist control (WLC) or 
      MBCT. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through examination of 
      retention rates, measures of group satisfaction and treatment barriers, and 
      qualitative interview. Forty-two Black adults (85% women) were consented; of 
      those, 34 (81%) completed preassessment and randomization. RESULTS: Feasibility 
      of study design was shown, with > 75% (n = 26) of randomized participants 
      completing the study through postassessment. Twenty-four individuals (70.5%) 
      completed through 1-month follow-up. Results showed high levels of group 
      acceptability across quantitative and qualitative measures. Perceived barriers to 
      psychological treatment were high, with an average of > 6 barriers present. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate feasibility and acceptability of MBCT group 
      interventions in urban primary care settings with trauma-exposed patients with 
      significant psychopathology. However, substantial barriers to treatment 
      engagement were endorsed and to improve numbers for successful engagement in the 
      intervention, continued efforts to reduce treatment barriers and increase access 
      to mindfulness-based interventions in underresourced communities are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the development of positive psychology, posttraumatic growth 
      research on cancer patients has attracted increasing attention from researchers. 
      It is immensely important to effectively increase the posttraumatic growth level 
      of cancer patients and improve their quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To investigate 
      the effectiveness of a nurse-led mindfulness-based Tai Chi Chuan (MTCC) programme 
      for increasing posttraumatic growth (PTG) and decreasing the perceived stress and 
      anxiety of breast cancer survivors. METHODS: A RCT was conducted. Participants 
      were randomly assigned to either the MTCC group or the control group. The 
      programme included 59 women with stage I-III breast cancer. Participants in the 
      intervention group participated in a nurse-led 8-week, twice a week, one-hour per 
      day mindfulness-based exercise programme. The effectiveness of the intervention 
      was measured three times (T1 - before intervention; T2 - after intervention; T3 - 
      one year after intervention) using validated scales, including the PTG inventory 
      (PTGI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). A 
      repeated-measure analysis of variance model was used to analyse the data. 
      RESULTS: Compared with the wait-list control group, the PTG level in the MTCC 
      group was much higher after the 8-week intervention and the follow-up (F 
      = 374.98, P < .000). The results showed that MTCC increased the level of PTG, and 
      the effect persisted 1 year after intervention. In addition, PSS (F = 55.22, P 
      < .000) and SAS (F = 148.92, P < .000) scores were significantly decreased at T2 
      and T3. CONCLUSION: The research preliminarily revealed that the MTCC programme 
      was simple, effective, and more suitable to clinical nurses which should be 
      recommended to cancer survivors to promote their recovery.

TI  - Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of 
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction on stress regulation and associated 
      neurocognitive mechanisms in stressed university students: the MindRest study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress-related disorders are a growing public health concern. While 
      stress is a natural and adaptive process, chronic exposure to stressors can lead 
      to dysregulation and take a cumulative toll on physical and mental well-being. 
      One approach to coping with stress and building resilience is through 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). By understanding the neural mechanisms 
      of MBSR, we can gain insight into how it reduces stress and what drives 
      individual differences in treatment outcomes. This study aims to establish the 
      clinical effects of MBSR on stress regulation in a population that is susceptible 
      to develop stress-related disorders (i.e., university students with mild to high 
      self-reported stress), to assess the role of large-scale brain networks in stress 
      regulation changes induced by MBSR, and to identify who may benefit most from 
      MBSR. METHODS: This study is a longitudinal two-arm randomised, wait-list 
      controlled trial to investigate the effects of MBSR on a preselected, Dutch 
      university student population with elevated stress levels. Clinical symptoms are 
      measured at baseline, post-treatment, and three months after training. Our 
      primary clinical symptom is perceived stress, with additional measures of 
      depressive and anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, stress resilience, positive mental 
      health, and stress reactivity in daily life. We investigate the effects of MBSR 
      on stress regulation in terms of behaviour, self-report measures, physiology, and 
      brain activity. Repetitive negative thinking, cognitive reactivity, emotional 
      allowance, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion will be tested as potential 
      mediating factors for the clinical effects of MBSR. Childhood trauma, personality 
      traits and baseline brain activity patterns will be tested as potential 
      moderators of the clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study aims to provide 
      valuable insights into the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing stress-related 
      symptoms in a susceptible student population and crucially, to investigate its 
      effects on stress regulation, and to identify who may benefit most from the 
      intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered on September 15, 2022, at

TI  - Effect of blended and unguided online delivery of mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy versus care as usual on distress among cancer patients and survivors: 
      protocol for the three-arm parallel randomized controlled buddy trial.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s40359-023-01052-2 [doi]
LID - 21
AB  - BACKGROUND: One third of cancer patients and survivors experience psychological 
      distress. Previous studies have shown that online mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (eMBCT) supports cancer patients and survivors in managing distress. Lack 
      of peer support and asynchronicity during online interventions have been reported 
      as barriers for treatment adherence and can result in higher drop-out rates. 
      Considering this, two new formats of eMBCT were created. The primary objective of 
      the Buddy trial is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of blended and unguided 
      eMBCT versus care as usual (CAU) on psychological distress among cancer patients 
      and survivors. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on other 
      psychological outcomes and investigating working mechanisms and treatment effect 
      moderators. METHODS: The Buddy trial is a parallel three-armed randomized 
      controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to blended 
      therapist-assisted eMBCT, unguided individual eMBCT or CAU. Eligible participants 
      will be Dutch-speaking adult cancer patients or survivors with access to 
      internet. The primary outcome will be psychological distress scores as assessed 
      by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale immediately post-treatment. 
      Secondary outcome measures include fear of cancer recurrence (FCRI), fatigue 
      (CIS-F), rumination (RRQ), mindfulness skills (FFMQ), decentering (EQ), 
      self-compassion (SCS-SF), positive mental health (MHCSF), health related quality 
      of life (EQ-5D), and costs associated with psychiatric illness (TiC-P). Outcome 
      measures will be evaluated at baseline, mid-treatment, immediately 
      post-treatment, and three-, six-, and nine-months follow-up. Possible mediators, 
      such as engagement with interventions (TWEETS), and moderators will be also 
      analyzed. DISCUSSION: There is room to improve eMBCT for cancer patients prior to 
      implementation to ensure adherence and scalability. Blended and unguided eMBCT 
      may reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life and be easily 
      accessible to cancer patients and survivors. Trial registration

TI  - Investigating the effect of an online self-compassion for weight management 
      (SC4WM) intervention on self-compassion, eating behaviour, physical activity and 
      body weight in adults seeking to manage weight: protocol for a randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individual weight management, defined as engaging in behaviours to 
      maintain or lose weight, can improve health and well-being. However, numerous 
      factors influence weight management outcomes, such as genetics, biology, stress, 
      the social and physical environment. Consequently, weight management can be hard. 
      Self-compassion, described as treating oneself kindly in times of failure or 
      distress, has shown promise in improving weight management outcomes. The 
      objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to examine the efficacy of an online 
      self-compassion for weight management (SC4WM) intervention coupled with an online 
      commercial weight management programme (WW Weight Watchers reimagined) with 
      increasing self-compassion and improving weight management outcomes (eating 
      behaviour, physical activity and body weight) in comparison with the WW programme 
      only and (2) to explore whether improvements in weight management outcomes are 
      moderated by eating restraint, weight self-stigma, perceived stress and 
      psychological coping. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To achieve these objectives, 240 
      participants seeking to manage their weight were randomised to either an online 
      behavioural commercial weight management programme (WW) or the online WW +SC4 WM 
      intervention. Validated measures of self-compassion, stress, weight self-stigma, 
      eating restraint, psychological coping and weight management outcomes were 
      administered online at baseline, 4 weeks and at a 12-week follow-up. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethics has been granted by the University of Auckland Health 
      Research Ethics committee. Results will be communicated in peer-review journals, 
      conferences and a doctoral thesis. If effective in increasing self-compassion and 
      improving weight management outcomes, the intervention could be made more widely 
      available to supplement behavioural weight management programmes. TRIAL

TI  - Internalized weight stigma in women with class III obesity: A randomized 
      controlled trial of a virtual lifestyle modification intervention followed by a 
      mindful self-compassion intervention.
PG  - 816-827
LID - 10.1002/osp4.616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Internalized weight stigma (Internalized-WS) is prevalent among 
      individuals with severe obesity, particularly women, and is associated with 
      shame, disordered eating, and weight gain. Effective, accessible interventions 
      that address both severe (Class-III) obesity and Internalized-WS are needed. This 
      randomized pilot trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
      efficacy of a fully-remote lifestyle modification intervention (LM) followed by 
      mindful self-compassion training (MSC) or control. METHODS: Twenty-eight women 
      with Class-III obesity (46.6 ± 3.7 kg/m(2)) and elevated Internalized-WS were 
      randomized to a virtually-delivered 4-month LM followed by a 2-month MSC or 
      cooking/dietary education (CON). Psychosocial measures/weight were assessed at 
      baseline, 4-(post-LM), 6-(post-MSC/CON), and 9-month (follow-up). RESULTS: 
      Improvements in Internalized-WS, shame, and self-compassion were observed with 
      LM. Mean 4-month weight loss was 6.3 ± 3.7%. MSC had lower attendance and 
      usefulness ratings versus CON. Post-MSC/CON, MSC yielded significant and/or 
      meaningful improvements in Internalized-WS, self-compassion, and intuitive eating 
      relative to CON. Weight loss did not differ by group at 6-month, and at 9-month 
      trended lower in MSC versus CON. CONCLUSION: Virtual LM is feasible, acceptable, 
      and leads to significant weight loss among women with severe obesity; MSC led to 
      further improved Internalized-WS, self-compassion, and intuitive eating. 
      Continued work is needed to elucidate effects of self-compassion training on 
      Internalized-WS, its mechanisms, and linkages to cardiometabolic health and 
      long-term weight loss.

TI  - Meeting suffering with kindness: effects of a brief self-compassion intervention 
      for female college students.
PG  - 794-807
LID - 10.1002/jclp.22076 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the effectiveness of a newly developed 
      3-week self-compassion group intervention for enhancing resilience and well-being 
      among female college students. METHOD: Fifty-two students were randomly assigned 
      to either an intervention designed to teach skills of self-compassion (n = 27) or 
      an active control group intervention in which general time management skills were 
      taught (n = 25). Both interventions comprised 3 group meetings held over 3 weeks. 
      To measure resilience and well-being gains, participants filled out a number of 
      questionnaires before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Results showed that 
      the self-compassion intervention led to significantly greater increases in 
      self-compassion, mindfulness, optimism, and self-efficacy, as well as 
      significantly greater decreases in rumination in comparison to the active control 
      intervention. Whereas both interventions increased life satisfaction and 
      connectedness, no differences were found for worry and mood. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings suggest that a brief self-compassion intervention has potential for 
      improving student resilience and well-being.

TI  - Existential and Mindfulness-Based Intervention to Increase Self-Compassion in 
      Apparently Healthy Subjects (the EXMIND Study): A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 538

LID - 538
AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness is a method of training the regulation of attention with 
      non-judgmental acceptance that is linked to beneficial effects on health. The 
      existential approach supports the uniqueness of each individual and helps to 
      provide meaning to their lives. In this randomized controlled trial, we examined 
      whether mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) and the existential approach could 
      be combined sequentially and whether they operated antagonistically or 
      cooperatively. Methods: One hundred thirty-seven participants aged 20 years or 
      older without any severe mental disorders were randomly assigned (1:1), via an 
      envelope method, to receive either 8-week MBI (N = 68) or 4-week MBI followed by 
      4-week existential approach (EXMIND) (N = 69). Participants were first allocated 
      to a waiting-list group and subsequently randomized to the MBI group or EXMIND 
      group. The primary outcome was self-compassion scale (SCS) total scores at 0, 4, 
      and 8 weeks during intervention or waiting. The analyses were performed by linear 
      mixed models for both primary and secondary outcomes following the 
      intention-to-treat principle. Results: Both MBI and EXMIND groups had 
      significantly increased SCS total scores compared to those of the waiting group, 
      with mean SCS total scores of 2.3 (SD 3.0) in the MBI group and 2.1 (2.9) in the 
      EXMIND group versus 0.3 (2.2) in the waiting group. Conclusions: Our findings 
      suggest that MBI followed by existential approach are not antagonistic and may 
      have cooperative effects, suggesting that EXMIND may be a useful treatment.

TI  - A feasibility and acceptability study of an adaptation of the Mindful 
      Self-Compassion program for adult cancer patients.
PG  - 130-140
LID - 10.1017/S1478951519000737 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Psychosocial interventions that mitigate psychosocial distress in 
      cancer patients are important. The primary aim of this study was to examine the 
      feasibility and acceptability of an adaptation of the Mindful Self-Compassion 
      (MSC) program among adult cancer patients. A secondary aim was to examine 
      pre-post-program changes in psychosocial wellbeing. METHOD: The research design 
      was a feasibility and acceptability study, with an examination of pre- to 
      post-intervention changes in psychosocial measures. A study information pack was 
      posted to 173 adult cancer patients 6 months-5 years post-diagnosis, with an 
      invitation to attend an eight-week group-based adaptation of the MSC program. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-two (19%) consented to the program, with 30 commencing. 
      Twenty-seven completed the program (mean age: 62.93 years, SD 14.04; 17 [63%] 
      female), attending a mean 6.93 (SD 1.11) group sessions. There were no 
      significant differences in medico-demographic factors between program-completers 
      and those who did not consent. However, there was a trend toward shorter time 
      since diagnosis in the program-completers group. Program-completers rated the 
      program highly regarding content, relevance to the concerns of cancer patients, 
      and the likelihood of recommending the program to other cancer patients. 
      Sixty-three percent perceived that their mental wellbeing had improved from pre- 
      to post-program; none perceived a deterioration in mental wellbeing. 
      Small-to-medium effects were observed for depressive symptoms, fear of cancer 
      recurrence, stress, loneliness, body image satisfaction, mindfulness, and 
      self-compassion. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The MSC program appears feasible and 
      acceptable to adults diagnosed with non-advanced cancer. The preliminary 
      estimates of effect sizes in this sample suggest that participation in the 
      program was associated with improvements in psychosocial wellbeing. Collectively, 
      these findings suggest that there may be value in conducting an adequately 
      powered randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the MSC program 
      in enhancing the psychosocial wellbeing of cancer patients.

PG  - 531-541
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000857 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Meditation apps are the most widely used mental health apps. The 
      precise mechanisms underlying their effects remain unclear. In particular, the 
      degree to which affect experienced during meditation is associated with outcomes 
      has not been established. METHOD: We used the meditation app arm of a recently 
      completed randomized controlled trial comparing a self-guided meditation app 
      (Healthy Minds Program) to a waitlist control. Predominantly distressed public 
      school employees (n = 243, 80.9% with clinically elevated depression and/or 
      anxiety) reported positive and negative affect during meditation practice. Data 
      were analyzed using two-level multivariate latent growth curve models 
      (observations nested within participants) that simultaneously attended to both 
      positive and negative affect. We examined whether positive and negative affect 
      during meditation changed over time and whether these changes were associated 
      with changes in psychological distress (parent trial's preregistered primary 
      outcome) at posttest or 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: On average, participants 
      reported decreased negative affect but no change in positive affect during 
      meditation over time. Increased positive affect and decreased negative affect 
      during meditation were associated with improvements in distress at posttest and 
      follow-up. Change in positive affect was a stronger predictor of distress at 
      follow-up than change in negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: Despite notions embedded 
      within mainstream mindfulness meditation training that deemphasize the importance 
      of the affective experience of practice (i.e., nonjudgmental awareness of present 
      moment experience, regardless of valence), results indicate that these 
      experiences contain signals associated with outcomes. Monitoring affect during 
      meditation may be worthwhile to guide intervention delivery (i.e., 
      measurement-based care, precision medicine). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024

TI  - A mindful self-compassion videoconference intervention for nationally recruited 
      posttreatment young adult cancer survivors: feasibility, acceptability, and 
      psychosocial outcomes.
PG  - 1759-1768
LID - 10.1007/s00520-017-3586-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Young adult (YA) cancer survivors report substantial distress, social 
      isolation, and body image concerns that can impede successful reintegration into 
      life years after treatment completion. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) 
      interventions focus on developing mindfulness and self-compassion for managing 
      distress, hardships, and perceived personal inadequacies. An MSC intervention 
      would be beneficial in supporting YA survivors' management of psychosocial 
      challenges that arise in survivorship; however, a telehealth intervention 
      modality is essential for reaching this geographically dispersed population. We 
      conducted a single-arm feasibility study of an MSC 8-week videoconference 
      intervention for nationally recruited YA survivors (ages 18-29). METHODS: The MSC 
      intervention was group-based, 90-minute videoconference sessions, held weekly 
      over 8 weeks, with audio-supplemented home practice. Feasibility and 
      acceptability were assessed via attendance rate and an intervention satisfaction 
      scale. Baseline to post-intervention changes in psychosocial outcomes (body 
      image, anxiety, depression, social isolation, posttraumatic growth, resilience, 
      self-compassion, mindfulness) were assessed using paired t tests and Cohen's d 
      effect sizes. RESULTS: Thirty-four participants were consented and 25 attended a 
      videoconference group. Feasibility was established with 84% attending at least 
      six of the eight sessions, and intervention acceptability was high (M = 4.36, 
      SD = 0.40, score range = 1-5). All psychosocial outcomes, except for resilience, 
      demonstrated significant changes (p < 0.002), with medium to large effect sizes 
      (Cohen's d > 0.5). CONCLUSION: YA survivors are interested in receiving an MSC 
      videoconference intervention. Feasibility, acceptance, and potential psychosocial 
      benefits of the intervention were demonstrated. Findings can be applied toward 
      the design of an efficacy randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life 
      for YA survivors in transition after cancer treatment.

TI  - Effect of m-health-based core stability exercise combined with self-compassion 
      training for patients with non-specific chronic low back pain: study protocol for 
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 265

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-specific chronic low back pain (NCLBP) has a high incidence, 
      which has a significant impact on a patient's body and mind and is a common 
      condition affecting people's quality of life. Core stability exercise (CSE) is a 
      modestly effective treatment for NCLBP; however, CSE has only been shown to be a 
      useful treatment option in the short term. Many clinical practice guidelines 
      recommend the use of a biopsychosocial framework to guide the management of 
      NCLBP. Self-compassion training (SCT) is a promising psychotherapy treatment 
      option for NCLBP; however, there is still a lack of research on CSE combined with 
      SCT. In this study, we will seek to determine whether CSE combined with SCT is an 
      effective treatment option for patients with NCLBP compared to CSE alone. 
      METHODS: In this study, we will randomize 166 adults with NCLBP to a combined SCT 
      and CSE arm or a CSE alone arm (83 participants per group). Both interventions 
      will consist of four weekly 1.5-h group sessions of CSE supplemented by home 
      practice. The combined group protocol also includes 2 h of SCT before CSE. 
      Interviewers masked to the treatment assignments will assess the outcomes at 4 
      and 16 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcomes are back pain disability 
      (based on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain intensity (NRS; 
      average pain, worst pain, average pain) at 16 weeks. DISCUSSION: If SCT is found 
      to enhance the effectiveness of CSE for patients with chronic back pain, the 
      results of the study may promote the development of mind-body therapies for 
      chronic low back pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

TI  - Self-Help for Social Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing a Mindfulness 
      and Acceptance-Based Approach With a Control Group.

AB  - There are many barriers to the delivery of evidence-based treatment, including 
      geographical location, cost, and stigma. Self-help may address some of these 
      factors but there is a paucity of research on the efficacy of self-help for many 
      problems, including social anxiety. The present research evaluated the efficacy 
      of a mindfulness and acceptance-based self-help approach for the treatment of 
      social anxiety. Individuals seeking help for social anxiety or shyness were 
      recruited from the community. Participants (N = 117) were randomly assigned to a 
      book (n = 58) or wait-list control condition (n = 59) on a 1:1 ratio. 
      Hierarchical linear modelling results supported the efficacy of the self-help 
      condition with between-group effect sizes on social anxiety outcomes ranging from 
      .74 to .79. Significant change was also observed on self-compassion, mindfulness, 
      acceptance, and depression. Some variables, including social anxiety and 
      acceptance, were assessed weekly for those in the book condition. Additional 
      participants (n = 35) were recruited for the book condition increasing the sample 
      size to 93 for the latent change score modelling analyses. A unidirectional model 
      was supported: increases in acceptance were associated with subsequent decreases 
      in social anxiety. Overall these results support the use of a mindfulness and 
      acceptance-based self-help approach for social anxiety.

TI  - Modulating affective experience and emotional intelligence with loving kindness 
      meditation and transcranial direct current stimulation: A pilot study.
PG  - 10-25
LID - 10.1080/17470919.2017.1397054 [doi]
AB  - Positive emotional perceptions and healthy emotional intelligence (EI) are 
      important for social functioning. In this study, we investigated whether loving 
      kindness meditation (LKM) combined with anodal transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) would facilitate improvements in EI and changes in affective 
      experience of visual stimuli. LKM has been shown to increase positive emotional 
      experiences and we hypothesized that tDCS could enhance these effects. 
      Eighty-seven undergraduates were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of LKM or a 
      relaxation control recording with anodal tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (left dlPFC) or right temporoparietal junction (right TPJ) at 
      0.1 or 2.0 milliamps. The primary outcomes were self-reported affect ratings of 
      images from the International Affective Picture System and EI as measured by the 
      Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Results indicated no 
      effects of training on EI, and no main effects of LKM, electrode placement, or 
      tDCS current strength on affect ratings. There was a significant interaction of 
      electrode placement by meditation condition (p = 0.001), such that those assigned 
      to LKM and right TPJ tDCS, regardless of current strength, rated neutral and 
      positive images more positively after training. Results suggest that LKM may 
      enhance positive affective experience.

TI  - Cultivating mindfulness: effects on well-being.
PG  - 840-62
LID - 10.1002/jclp.20491 [doi]
AB  - There has been great interest in determining if mindfulness can be cultivated and 
      if this cultivation leads to well-being. The current study offers preliminary 
      evidence that at least one aspect of mindfulness, measured by the Mindful 
      Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; K. W. Brown & R. M. Ryan, 2003), can be 
      cultivated and does mediate positive outcomes. Further, adherence to the 
      practices taught during the meditation-based interventions predicted positive 
      outcomes. College undergraduates were randomly allocated between training in two 
      distinct meditation-based interventions, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction 
      (MBSR; J. Kabat-Zinn, 1990; n=15) and E. Easwaran's (1978/1991) Eight Point 
      Program (EPP; n=14), or a waitlist control (n=15). Pretest, posttest, and 8-week 
      follow-up data were gathered on self-report outcome measures. Compared to 
      controls, participants in both treatment groups (n=29) demonstrated increases in 
      mindfulness at 8-week follow-up. Further, increases in mindfulness mediated 
      reductions in perceived stress and rumination. These results suggest that 
      distinct meditation-based practices can increase mindfulness as measured by the 
      MAAS, which may partly mediate benefits. Implications and future directions are 
      discussed.

TI  - Mindful yoga intervention as add-on to treatment as usual for young women with 
      major depressive disorder: Results from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 925-941
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000777 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the added value of a 9-week mindful yoga intervention (MYI) 
      as add-on to treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing depression for young women 
      (18-34 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT; n = 171) comparing TAU + MYI with TAU-only. Assessments were at 
      baseline, postintervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome 
      measures were clinician-rated and self-reported symptoms of depression, together 
      with a diagnostic interview to establish MDD diagnosis that was restricted to the 
      baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments. Quality of life in various domains 
      was assessed as secondary outcome measure. As potential mediators for treatment 
      efficacy, we included self-report measures of rumination, self-criticism, 
      self-compassion, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived body awareness and 
      dispositional mindfulness, together with behavioral measures of attentional bias 
      (AB) and depression-related self-associations. RESULTS: Adding MYI to TAU did not 
      lead to greater reduction of depression symptoms, lower rate of MDD diagnosis or 
      increase in quality of life in various domains of functioning at post and 
      follow-up assessments. There were no indirect effects through any of the 
      potential mediators, with the exception of self-compassion. CONCLUSION: Adding 
      MYI to TAU appeared not more efficacious than TAU-only in reducing depression 
      symptoms in young women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights

AB  - This study examined the impact of exposure to beauty, self-compassion, and travel 
      (control) TikTok videos on young women's face-related appearance shame and 
      anxiety, self-compassion, mood, upward appearance comparisons and thoughts. 
      Undergraduate women (N = 115) were randomly assigned to view one of three 
      compilation TikTok videos on either beauty tips, self-compassion strategies, or 
      travel destinations. Upward appearance comparisons and thoughts were assessed at 
      post-test only given the items related to video exposure; all other measures were 
      assessed at pre- and post-test. Controlling for pre-test measures, results showed 
      that face-related appearance shame and anxiety, and negative mood were higher, 
      whereas self-compassion was lower in the beauty group relative to the travel 
      control and self-compassion groups. Self-compassion was higher in the 
      self-compassion group relative to the travel control. Women in the beauty group 
      reported more upward appearance comparisons and appearance thoughts relative to 
      women in the travel control and self-compassion groups. The self-compassion group 
      reported more appearance thoughts relative to the travel control. Findings 
      contribute to prior research by showing that brief exposure to beauty TikToks may 
      have a negative effect on how young women feel about their appearance, but also 
      how self-compassion videos may help young women feel more compassionate toward 
      themselves.

TI  - HORYZONS trial: protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a moderated online 
      social therapy to maintain treatment effects from first-episode psychosis 
      services.
PG  - e024104
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024104 [doi]
LID - e024104
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Specialised early intervention services have demonstrated improved 
      outcomes in first-episode psychosis (FEP); however, clinical gains may not be 
      sustained after patients are transferred to regular care. Moreover, many patients 
      with FEP remain socially isolated with poor functional outcomes. To address this, 
      our multidisciplinary team has developed a moderated online social media therapy 
      (HORYZONS) designed to enhance social functioning and maintain clinical gains 
      from specialist FEP services. HORYZONS merges: (1) peer-to-peer social 
      networking; (2) tailored therapeutic interventions; (3) expert and 
      peer-moderation; and (4) new models of psychological therapy (strengths and 
      mindfulness-based interventions) targeting social functioning. The aim of this 
      trial is to determine whether following 2 years of specialised support and 
      18-month online social media-based intervention (HORYZONS) is superior to 18 
      months of regular care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-blind 
      randomised controlled trial. The treatment conditions include HORYZONS plus 
      treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. We recruited 170 young people with FEP, 
      aged 16-27 years, in clinical remission and nearing discharge from Early 
      Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne. The study includes four 
      assessment time points, namely, baseline, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month 
      follow-up. The study is due for completion in July 2018 and included a 40-month 
      recruitment period and an 18-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is social 
      functioning at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include rate of hospital 
      admissions, cost-effectiveness, vocational status, depression, social support, 
      loneliness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, anxiety, psychological well-being, 
      satisfaction with life, quality of life, positive and negative psychotic symptoms 
      and substance use. Social functioning will be also assessed in real time through 
      our Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment tool. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee (2013.146) provided ethics 
      approval for this study. Findings will be made available through scientific 
      journals and forums and to the public via social media and the Orygen website.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation regulates anterior insula activity during empathy for 
      social pain.
PG  - 4034-4046
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23646 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress, promote health, and well-being, as 
      well as to increase compassionate behavior toward others. It reduces distress to 
      one's own painful experiences, going along with altered neural responses, by 
      enhancing self-regulatory processes and decreasing emotional reactivity. In order 
      to investigate if mindfulness similarly reduces distress and neural activations 
      associated with empathy for others' socially painful experiences, which might in 
      the following more strongly motivate prosocial behavior, the present study 
      compared trait, and state effects of long-term mindfulness meditation (LTM) 
      practice. To do so we acquired behavioral data and neural activity measures using 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an empathy for social pain 
      task while manipulating the meditation state between two groups of LTM 
      practitioners that were matched with a control group. The results show increased 
      activations of the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as 
      well as the medial prefrontal cortex and temporal pole when sharing others' 
      social suffering, both in LTM practitioners and controls. However, in LTM 
      practitioners, who practiced mindfulness meditation just prior to observing 
      others' social pain, left AI activation was lower and the strength of AI 
      activation following the mindfulness meditation was negatively associated with 
      trait compassion in LTM practitioners. The findings suggest that current 
      mindfulness meditation could provide an adaptive mechanism in coping with 
      distress due to the empathic sharing of others' suffering, thereby possibly 
      enabling compassionate behavior. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4034-4046, 2017. © 2017 Wiley

AB  - Mindfulness meditation is a self-regulatory practice premised on sustaining 
      nonreactive awareness of arising sensory events that reliably reduces pain. Yet, 
      the specific analgesic mechanisms supporting mindfulness have not been 
      comprehensively disentangled from the potential nonspecific factors supporting 
      this technique. Increased parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity is 
      associated with pain relief corresponding to a number of cognitive manipulations. 
      However, the relationship between the PNS and mindfulness-based pain attenuation 
      remains unknown. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the 
      role of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), a marker of PNS activity, 
      during mindfulness-based pain relief as compared to a validated, sham-mindfulness 
      meditation technique that served as a breathing-based control. Sixty-two healthy 
      volunteers (31 females; 31 males) were randomized to a 4-session (25 min/session) 
      mindfulness or sham-mindfulness training regimen. Before and after each group's 
      respective training, participants were administered noxious (49°C) and innocuous 
      (35°C) heat to the right calf. HF HRV and respiration rate were recorded during 
      thermal stimulation and pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings were collected 
      after each stimulation series. The primary analysis revealed that during 
      mindfulness meditation, higher HF HRV was more strongly associated with lower 
      pain unpleasantness ratings when compared to sham-mindfulness meditation 
      (B = -.82, P = .04). This finding is in line with the prediction that 
      mindfulness-based meditation engages distinct mechanisms from sham-mindfulness 
      meditation to reduce pain. However, the same prediction was not confirmed for 
      pain intensity ratings (B = -.41). Secondary analyses determined that mindfulness 
      and sham-mindfulness meditation similarly reduced pain ratings, decreased 
      respiration rate, and increased HF HRV (between group ps < .05). More mechanistic 
      work is needed to reliably determine the role of parasympathetic activation in 
      mindfulness-based pain relief as compared to other meditative techniques. 
      Perspective: Mindfulness has been shown to engage multiple mechanisms to reduce 
      pain. The present study extends on this work to show that higher HRV is 
      associated with mindfulness-induced reductions in pain unpleasantness, but not 
      pain intensity ratings, when compared to sham-mindfulness meditation. These 
      findings warrant further investigation into the mechanisms engaged by mindfulness 
      as compared to placebo.

TI  - Effects of compassion meditation on a psychological model of charitable donation.
PG  - 691-705
LID - 10.1037/emo0000119 [doi]
AB  - Compassion is critical for societal wellbeing. Yet, it remains unclear how 
      specific thoughts and feelings motivate compassionate behavior, and we lack a 
      scientific understanding of how to effectively cultivate compassion. Here, we 
      conducted 2 studies designed to a) develop a psychological model predicting 
      compassionate behavior, and b) test this model as a mediator of a Compassion 
      Meditation (CM) intervention and identify the "active ingredients" of CM. In 
      Study 1, we developed a model predicting compassionate behavior, operationalized 
      as real-money charitable donation, from a linear combination of self-reported 
      tenderness, personal distress, perceived blamelessness, and perceived 
      instrumental value of helping with high cross-validated accuracy, r = .67, p < 
      .0001. Perceived similarity to suffering others did not predict charitable 
      donation when controlling for other feelings and attributions. In Study 2, a 
      randomized controlled trial, we tested the Study 1 model as a mediator of CM and 
      investigated active ingredients. We compared a smartphone-based CM program to 2 
      conditions-placebo oxytocin and a Familiarity intervention-to control for 
      expectancy effects, demand characteristics, and familiarity effects. Relative to 
      control conditions, CM increased charitable donations, and changes in the Study 1 
      model of feelings and attributions mediated this effect (pab = .002). The 
      Familiarity intervention led to decreases in primary outcomes, while placebo 
      oxytocin had no significant effects on primary outcomes. Overall, this work 
      contributes a quantitative model of compassionate behavior, and informs our 
      understanding of the change processes and intervention components of CM.

TI  - Investigating the Specific Effects of an Online Mindfulness-Based Self-Help 
      Intervention on Stress and Underlying Mechanisms.
PG  - 1245-1257
LID - 10.1007/s12671-017-0867-y [doi]
AB  - Previous research examining the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) 
      and their mechanisms of change has been hampered by failure to control for 
      non-specific factors, such as social support and interaction with group members, 
      facilitator contact and expectation of benefit, meaning that it remained possible 
      that benefits of MBIs could have been attributable, perhaps entirely, to 
      non-specific elements. This experimental study examined the effects of a 2-week 
      online mindfulness-based self-help (MBSH) intervention compared to a well-matched 
      classical music control condition and a waitlist control condition on perceived 
      stress. This study also tested mindfulness, self-compassion and worry as 
      mechanisms of the effects of MBSH versus both control conditions on stress. 
      University students and staff (N = 214) were randomised to MBSH, classical music, 
      or waitlist conditions and completed self-report measures pre-, mid- and 
      post-intervention. Post-intervention, MBSH was found to significantly reduce 
      stress compared to both control conditions. Bootstrapping-based mediation 
      analyses used standardised residualised change scores for all variables, with 
      mediators computed as change from baseline to mid-intervention, and the outcome 
      computed as change from baseline to post-intervention. Changes in mindfulness, 
      self-compassion and worry were found to significantly mediate the effects of MBSH 
      versus both control conditions on changes in stress. Findings suggest that 
      cultivating mindfulness specifically confers benefits to stress and that these 
      benefits may occur through improving theorised mechanisms.

AB  - Although several interventions that target obesity have been examined, the 
      success of these interventions in generating and maintaining positive results has 
      yet to be confirmed. This study protocol therefore presents a trial aimed at 
      analyzing the effectiveness of a well-being-centered acceptance and commitment 
      therapy (ACT)- and mindfulness-based group intervention following the 
      valued-based healthy living (VHL) approach (Mind&Life intervention) for 
      individuals experiencing overweight-related distress. A randomized controlled 
      trial with two parallel groups will be conducted in 110 adults attending primary 
      care units with overweight or obesity. Participants will be randomly allocated to 
      one of the two study conditions. Interventions will either be the treatment as 
      usual (TAU) or the Mind&Life intervention-an ACT- and mindfulness-based 
      intervention-plus the TAU intervention. Quality of life, weight self-stigma, 
      general health status, eating habits, physical activity, eating behavior, 
      anthropometric, body composition, cardiovascular, and physiological variables, as 
      well as process variables, will be examined at baseline, posttreatment, 6-month 
      follow-up, and 1-year follow-up. This trial aims to offer a novel psychological 
      approach for addressing the psychological and physical impairments suffered by 
      people with overweight or obesity in the current environment. ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - Work stress is a major contributor to absenteeism and reduced work productivity. 
      A randomised and controlled study in employee-volunteers (with Perceived Stress 
      Scale [PSS-14]>22) was performed to assess a mindfulness program based on brief 
      integrated mindfulness practices (M-PBI) with the aim of reducing stress in the 
      workplace. The PSS-14 of the employees before and after 8-weeks M-PBI program, as 
      well as after a 20-week follow-up, was assessed (primary endpoint). The employees 
      also carried the following questionnaires (secondary endpoints): Five Facet 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Experiences 
      Questionnaire-Decentering (EQ-D), and Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey 
      (MBI-GS). Heart Rate Variability (HRV) was measured during each session in a 
      subgroup of employees (n = 10) of the interventional group randomly selected. A 
      total of 40 employees (77.5% female median [SD] age of 36.6 [5.6] years) took 
      part in this study: 21 and 19 in the intervention and control group, 
      respectively. No differences in baseline characteristics were encountered between 
      the groups. Results show a significant decrease in stress and increase in 
      mindfulness over time in the intervention group (PSS-14 and FFMQ; p < 0.05 both). 
      Additionally, an improvement in decentering (EQ-D), self-compassion (SCS) and 
      burnout (MBI-GS) were also observed compared to the control group (p < 0.05 in 
      all). HRV measurement also showed an improvement. In conclusion, a brief 
      practices, 8-weeks M-BIP program is an effective tool to quickly reduce stress 
      and improve well-being in a workplace.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Age-Well observational, cross-sectional study investigates the 
      affective and cognitive mechanisms of meditation expertise with behavioral, 
      neuroimaging, sleep, and biological measures sensitive to aging and Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). METHODS: Thirty cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 65 years or 
      older with at least 10,000 hours of practice in mindfulness meditation (MM) and 
      loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) are selected. The outcomes are 
      the neuroimaging brain correlates of MM and LKCM and the assessments of long-term 
      meditation practices on behavioral, neural, and biological measures as compared 
      to nonmeditator older controls from the Age-Well randomized controlled trial. 
      RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection began in late 2016 and will be completed 
      by late 2019. DISCUSSION: Results are expected to foster the understanding of the 
      effects of meditation expertise on aging and of the mechanisms of action 
      underlying the meditation intervention in the Age-Well randomized controlled 
      trial. These finding will contribute to the design of meditation-based prevention 
      randomized controlled trials for the aged population and to the exploration of 
      the possible long-time developmental trajectory of meditation training.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of Tong Len Meditation Practice in Cancer Patients: 
      Evaluation of a Distant Psychological Healing Effect.

AB  - CONTEXT: Tong Len meditation is an important therapeutic tool in the Tibetan 
      medicine, and it can be used for self-healing and/or to heal others. Currently, 
      in the West, there is no scientific study concerning the efficacy of a Tong Len 
      distant healing effect on psychological disorders in cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: 
      To evaluate a distant healing effect of Tong Len meditation on stress, anxiety, 
      depression, fatigue, and self-perceived quality of life in cancer patients. These 
      psychological objectives were chosen as a consequence of the limited scientific 
      literature of present day. DESIGN: We performed a double-blind randomized 
      controlled trial on 103 cancer patients with tumors. Overall, 12 meditators used 
      Tong Len in aid of 52 patients randomly selected as experimental group, while the 
      remaining 51 patients constituted the control group. Patients and meditators did 
      not know each other. All patients completed profile of mood states (POMS) and 
      European Quality of Life-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires before treatment 
      (T0), after two (T1) and three months of treatment (T2), and one month after 
      treatment cessation (T3). RESULTS: With regard to the parameters related to 
      depression, a statistically significant improvement (P = .003) was observed in 
      the treatment group compared to controls. On the other hand, the vigor/activity 
      parameter saw significant improvements in the control group (P = .009). Both 
      groups exhibited significant improvements in the other factors assessed in the 
      POMS and EQ-5D questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide sufficient 
      evidence supporting an efficacy of Tong Len meditation in distant psychological 
      healing as compared to a control condition. The research highlighted some 
      psychological improvements through Tong Len distant meditation in a group of 
      patients unknown to meditators. Therefore, the enhancement detected in most 
      parameters in both treatment and control groups raises interest on in-depth 
      analysis and evaluation of distant meditation on cancer patients to mitigate 
      psychological problems caused by the disease.

TI  - Effects of a mindfulness-based versus a health self-management intervention on 
      objective cognitive performance in older adults with subjective cognitive decline 
      (SCD): a secondary analysis of the SCD-Well randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/s13195-022-01057-w [doi]
LID - 125
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) perceive 
      that their cognition has declined but do not show objective impairment on 
      neuropsychological tests. Individuals with SCD are at elevated risk of objective 
      cognitive decline and incident dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions 
      (including mindfulness-based and health self-management approaches) are a 
      potential strategy to maintain or improve cognition in SCD, which may ultimately 
      reduce dementia risk. METHODS: This study utilized data from the SCD-Well 
      randomized controlled trial. One hundred forty-seven older adults with SCD 
      (M(Age) = 72.7 years; 64% female) were recruited from memory clinics in four 
      European countries and randomized to one of two group-based, 8-week 
      interventions: a Caring Mindfulness-based Approach for Seniors (CMBAS) or a 
      health self-management program (HSMP). Participants were assessed at baseline, 
      post-intervention (week 8), and at 6-month follow-up (week 24) using a range of 
      cognitive tests. From these tests, three composites were derived-an "abridged" 
      Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5(Abridged)), an attention 
      composite, and an executive function composite. Both per-protocol and 
      intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Linear mixed models evaluated the 
      change in outcomes between and within arms and adjusted for covariates and 
      cognitive retest effects. Sensitivity models repeated the per-protocol analyses 
      for participants who attended ≥ 4 intervention sessions. RESULTS: Across all 
      cognitive composites, there were no significant time-by-trial arm interactions 
      and no measurable cognitive retest effects; sensitivity analyses supported these 
      results. Improvements, however, were observed within both trial arms on the 
      PACC5(Abridged) from baseline to follow-up (Δ [95% confidence interval]: CMBAS = 
      0.34 [0.19, 0.48]; HSMP = 0.30 [0.15, 0.44]). There was weaker evidence of an 
      improvement in attention but no effects on executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Two 
      non-pharmacological interventions conferred small, non-differing improvements to 
      a global cognitive composite sensitive to amyloid-beta-related decline. There was 
      weaker evidence of an effect on attention, and no evidence of an effect on 
      executive function. Importantly, observed improvements were maintained beyond the 
      end of the interventions. Improving cognition is an important step toward 
      dementia prevention, and future research is needed to delineate the mechanisms of 
      action of these interventions and to utilize clinical endpoints (i.e., 
      progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia). TRIAL REGISTRATION:
