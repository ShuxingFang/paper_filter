TI  - Effectiveness of a mindfulness education program in primary health care
      professionals: a pragmatic controlled trial.
PG  - 4-12

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Burnout is a very prevalent type of stress among health
      professionals. It affects their well-being, performance, and attitude toward
      patients. This study assessed the effectiveness of a training program for primary
      health care professionals designed to reduce burnout and mood disturbance,
      increase empathy, and develop mindfulness. METHODS: Pragmatic randomized
      controlled trial with pre- and postintervention measurements of 68 primary health
      care professionals (43 in the intervention and 25 in the control group) in Spain.
      The intervention consisted of presentations of clinically relevant topics,
      mindfulness-based coping strategies, mindfulness practice, yoga, and group
      discussions (8 sessions of 2.5 hours per week plus a 1-day session of 8 hours).
      Outcome measures included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Profile of Mood States,
      Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Baer's Five Facets Mindfulness
      Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on changes in personal habits and mindfulness
      practice. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: The
      intervention group improved in the 4 scales measured. The magnitude of the change
      was large in total mood disturbance (difference between groups -7.1; standardized
      effect-size [SES] 1.15) and mindfulness (difference between groups 11; SES 0.9)
      and moderate in the burnout (difference between groups -7; SES 0.74) and empathy
      scales (difference between groups 5.2; SES 0.71). No significant differences were
      found in the control group. DISCUSSION: Our study supports the use of
      mindfulness-based programs as part of continuing professional education to reduce
      and prevent burnout, promote positive attitudes among health professionals,
      strengthen patient-provider relationships, and enhance well-being.

TI  - Changes in Empathy Mediate the Effects of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy but
      Not Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Social Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 1098-1111

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) has been shown to be associated with difficulty in
      the ability to vicariously share others' positive emotions (positive affective
      empathy). Mixed evidence also suggests potentially impaired recognition of the
      positive and negative emotions of others (cognitive empathy) and impaired or
      enhanced sharing of the negative emotions of others (negative affective empathy).
      Therefore, we examined whether two efficacious treatments for SAD,
      cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction
      (MBSR), improve empathy in SAD relative to a wait-list condition and whether
      improvements in empathy mediate improvements in social anxiety. In the context of
      a randomized controlled trial, participants with SAD completed an empathy task at
      baseline, posttreatment/wait-list (N = 81), and 1-year follow-up (N = 37).
      Relative to both MBSR and wait-list, CBGT resulted in significant improvements in
      positive affective empathy. CBGT-related changes in positive affective empathy
      also mediated improvements in social anxiety at both posttreatment/wait-list and
      at 1-year follow-up. Other indices of empathy did not change differentially
      across the three conditions. Therefore, one way in which CBGT may specifically
      confer benefits to individuals with SAD is through increasing their ability or
      willingness to share in the positive emotions of others.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on objective and subjective
      sleep parameters in women with breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 424-32
LID - 10.1002/pon.3603 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
      mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer survivors (MBSR(BC)) on
      multiple measures of objective and subjective sleep parameters among breast
      cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: Data were collected using a two-armed randomized
      controlled design among BCS enrolled in either a 6-week MBSR(BC) program or a
      usual care (UC) group with a 12-week follow-up. The present analysis is a subset
      of the larger parent trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01177124).
      Seventy-nine BCS participants (mean age 57 years), stages 0-III, were randomly
      assigned to either the formal (in-class) 6-week MBSR(BC) program or UC.
      Subjective sleep parameters (SSP) (i.e., sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI)) and objective sleep parameters (OSP) (i.e., actigraphy)
      were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after completing the MBSR(BC) or
      UC program. RESULTS: Results showed indications of a positive effect of MBSR(BC)
      on OSP at 12 weeks on sleep efficiency (78.2% MBSR(BC) group versus 74.6% UC
      group, p = 0.04), percent of sleep time (81.0% MBSR(BC) group versus 77.4% UC
      group, p = 0.02), and less number waking bouts (93.5 in MBSR(BC) group versus
      118.6 in the UC group, p < 0.01). Small nonsignificant improvements were found in
      SSP in the MBSR(BC) group from baseline to 6 weeks (PSQI total score, p = 0.09).
      No significant relationship was observed between minutes of MBSR(BC) practice and
      SSP or OSP. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBSR(BC) may be an efficacious
      treatment to improve objective and subjective sleep parameters in BCS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence links depression and stress to more rapid progression of
      HIV-1 disease. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test whether an
      intervention aimed at improving stress management and emotion regulation,
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), would improve immunological (i.e. CD4+
      T-cell counts) and psychological outcomes in persons with HIV-1 infection.
      METHODS: We randomly assigned participants with HIV-1 infection and CD4 T-cell
      counts >350 cells/μl who were not on antiretroviral therapy in a 1:1 ratio to
      either an MBSR group (n = 89) or an HIV disease self-management skills group
      (n = 88). The study was conducted at the University of California at San
      Francisco. We assessed immunologic (CD4, c-reactive protein, IL-6, and d-dimer)
      and psychological measures (Beck Depression Inventory for depression, modified
      Differential Emotions Scale for positive and negative affect, Perceived
      stress-scale, and mindfulness) at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of the
      intervention; we used multiple imputation to address missing values. RESULTS: We
      observed statistically significant improvements from baseline to 3-months within
      the MBSR group in depression, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, and
      mindfulness; between group differences in change were significantly greater in
      the MBSR group only for positive affect (per item difference on DES-positive
      0.25, 95% CI 0.049, 0.44, p = .015). By 12 months the between group difference in
      positive affect was not statistically significant, although both groups had
      trends toward improvements compared to baseline in several psychological outcomes
      that were maintained at 12-months; these improvements were only statistically
      significant for depression and negative affect in the MBSR group and perceived
      stress for the control group. The groups did not differ significantly on rates of
      antiretroviral therapy initiation (MBSR = 39%, control = 29%, p = .22). After
      12 months, the mean decrease in CD4+ T-cell count was 49.6 cells/μl in
      participants in the MBSR arm, compared to 54.2 cells/μl in the control group, a
      difference of 4.6 cells favoring the MBSR group (95% CI, -44.6, 53.7, p = .85).
      The between group differences in other immunologic-related outcomes (c-reactive
      protein, IL-6, HIV-1 viral load, and d-dimer) were not statistically significant
      at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR improved positive affect more than an active
      control arm in the 3 months following the start of the intervention. However,
      this difference was not maintained over the 12-month follow-up and there were no
      significant differences in immunologic outcomes between intervention groups.
      These results emphasize the need for further carefully designed research if we
      are to translate evidence linking psychological states to immunological outcomes
      into evidence-based clinical practices.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the incidence of and survival from breast cancer continue to
      raise, interventions to reduce anxiety and depression before, during and after
      treatment are needed. Previous studies have reported positive effects of a
      structured 8-week group mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) among
      patients with cancer and other conditions. PURPOSE: To test the effect of such a
      programme on anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer in a
      population-based randomised controlled study. METHODS: A total of 336 women who
      had been operated on for breast cancer (stage I-III) were randomised to usual
      care or MBSR+usual care. Questionnaires including the Symptom Checklist-90r
      anxiety and depression subscales and the Center for Epidemiological
      Studies-Depression scale were administered before randomisation and immediately,
      6 and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses
      showed differences between groups in levels of anxiety (p=0.0002) and depression
      (SCL-90r, p<0.0001; CES-D, p=0.0367) after 12 months. Graphical comparisons of
      participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline showed a
      significantly greater decrease in the intervention group throughout follow-up and
      no differences among least affected participants. Medium-to-large effects were
      found for all outcomes in the intervention group in analyses of change scores
      after 12 months' follow-up. CONCLUSION: The 8-week group based MBSR intervention
      had clinically meaningful, statistically significant effects on depression and
      anxiety after 12 months' follow-up, and medium-to-large effect sizes. Our
      findings support the dissemination of MBSR among women with breast cancer.

TI  - Psychosocial interventions affecting global perceptions of control in people with
      Parkinson's disease: a scoping review.
PG  - 443-452
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2023.2169376 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Perceived control is an important construct for the psychological
      well-being of people affected by chronic conditions, and higher perceived control
      is associated with better outcomes. Psychosocial interventions have been trialled
      in these populations to improve both global and specific perceptions of control.
      However, most interventions involving people with Parkinson's have focused on
      single-domain forms of control, while those addressing global perceived control
      are yet to be reviewed. This study aimed to identify and map the types of
      psychosocial interventions in individuals with Parkinson's which have included
      forms of global perceived control as an outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scoping
      review based on a search across MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Academic Search
      Ultimate. RESULTS: From an initial return of 4388 citations, 12 citations were
      eventually included. These consisted of 8 quantitative and 4 qualitative studies,
      and covered 4 overarching categories of psychosocial interventions. Mixed results
      were found for cognitive, educational, and physical interventions, while a
      randomised controlled trial on mindfulness-based lifestyle programme showed more
      preliminary positive evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Further rigorous research is required
      on the topic to build on these preliminary findings. In the meantime, clinicians
      may need to consider programmes which proved effective with populations similar
      to people with Parkinson's.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPerceived control is a
      psychological construct important for people with chronic illnesses, which can be
      targeted by psychosocial interventions.This article reviewed psychosocial
      interventions targeting global forms of perceived control in Parkinson's.Mixed
      results were reported for the cognitive, educational, and physical interventions
      identified, while a randomised controlled trial on a mindfulness-based lifestyle
      programme showed more promising evidence.In the meantime, clinicians may need to
      consider programmes found to be effective with people with similar conditions to
      Parkinson's.

TI  - The LIFEwithIBD Intervention: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of
      a Face-to-Face Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Compassion-Based
      Intervention Tailored to People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
PG  - 699367
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.699367 [doi]
LID - 699367
AB  - Background: There is ample evidence of the high mental health burden caused by
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Several constructs such as experiential
      avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have recently emerged as
      potential intervention targets to improve mental health in IBD. Psychotherapeutic
      models such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based
      interventions are known to target these constructs. In this protocol, we aim to
      describe a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of an
      ACT and compassion-focused intervention named Living with Intention, Fullness,
      and Engagement with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (LIFEwithIBD) intervention +
      Treatment As Usual (TAU) vs. TAU in improving psychological distress, quality of
      life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame,
      psychological flexibility, self-compassion, disease activity, inflammation
      biomarkers, and gut microbiota diversity. Methods: This trial is registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03840707, date assigned 13/02/2019). The
      LIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation to the IBD population of the Mind
      programme for people with cancer, an acceptance, mindfulness, and
      compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered in a group format. The
      LIFEwithIBD intervention's structure and topics are presented in this protocol.
      Participants were recruited at the Gastroenterology Service of the Coimbra
      University Hospital between June and September 2019. Of the 355 patients
      screened, 61 participants were selected, randomly assigned to one of two
      conditions [experimental group (LIFEwithIBD + TAU) or control group (TAU)] and
      completed the baseline assessment. Outcome measurement took place at baseline,
      post-intervention, 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Discussion: Results from this RCT
      will support future studies testing the LIFEwithIBD intervention or other
      acceptance and/or compassion-based interventions for IBD.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for multiple chemical sensitivity: a study
      protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-13-179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a condition characterized by
      recurrent, self-reported symptoms from multiple organ systems, attributable to
      exposure to a wide range of chemically unrelated substances at low levels. The
      pathophysiology is unknown, and affected individuals generally favor avoidance of
      the symptom triggering substances as a coping strategy. The impact of MCS on
      daily life may thus be severe. An intervention that may effectively reduce the
      impact of MCS, alleviate the symptoms and the psychological distress associated
      with the condition is therefore highly needed. In this study we will assess the
      effects of a mindfulness-based cognitive (MBCT) program on MCS. METHODS/DESIGN:
      Using a randomized controlled design (RCT), we will compare MBCT with treatment
      as usual (TAU). The MBCT intervention will include 8 weekly 2.5 hour sessions,
      and 45 minutes of mindfulness home practice 6 days each week. Participants will
      be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6 and 12
      months' follow-up. Based on sample size estimation, 82 participants will be
      randomized to either the MBCT intervention or to TAU. The primary outcome will be
      a measure of the impact of MCS on the participants' lives. The secondary outcome
      measures are physical symptoms of psychological distress, perceived stress,
      illness perceptions, QOL, and work ability. Lastly, we will assess whether any
      effect of MBCT on the primary effect measure is mediated by level of mindfulness,
      self-compassion, perceived stress, and rumination. DISCUSSION: This trial will
      provide important information on the effects of MBCT on MCS. TRIALS REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effectiveness of providing university students with a mindfulness-based
      intervention to increase resilience to stress: 1-year follow-up of a pragmatic
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 151-160
LID - 10.1136/jech-2020-214390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is concern that increasing demand for student mental health
      services reflects deteriorating student well-being. We designed a pragmatic,
      parallel, single-blinded randomised controlled trial hypothesising that providing
      mindfulness courses to university students would promote their resilience to
      stress up to a year later. Here we present 1-year follow-up outcomes. METHODS:
      University of Cambridge students without severe mental illness or crisis were
      randomised (1:1, remote software-generated random numbers), to join an 8-week
      mindfulness course adapted for university students (Mindfulness Skills for
      Students (MSS)), or to mental health support as usual (SAU). RESULTS: We
      randomised 616 students; 53% completed the 1-year follow-up questionnaire.
      Self-reported psychological distress and mental well-being improved in the MSS
      arm for up to 1 year compared to SAU (p<0.001). Effects were smaller than during
      the examination period. No significant differences between arms were detected in
      the use of University Counselling Service and other support resources, but there
      was a trend for MSS participants having milder needs. There were no differences
      in students' workload management; MSS participants made more donations. Home
      practice had positive dose-response effects; few participants meditated. No
      adverse effects related to self-harm, suicidality or harm to others were
      detected. CONCLUSION: Loss to follow-up is a limitation, but evidence suggests
      beneficial effects on students' average psychological distress that last for at
      least a year. Effects are on average larger at stressful times, consistent with
      the hypothesis that this type of mindfulness training increases resilience to
      stress. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12615001160527.

TI  - Compassion-focused self-help for psychological distress associated with skin
      conditions: a randomized feasibility trial.
PG  - 1095-1114
LID - 10.1080/08870446.2019.1707829 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study tested the feasibility of a self-help intervention based on
      Compassion-Focused Theory (CFT), and estimated treatment effects in a population
      of adults with skin conditions and associated psychological distress.Design: A
      randomized-controlled design was used, with 176 participants being allocated to
      either CFT-based self-help or a waitlist control group, who received usual
      medical care. The two-week intervention was provided by email.Main Outcome
      Measures: Treatment adherence and attrition rates were calculated, and
      effectiveness was estimated using measures of perceived stress, anxiety,
      depression, dermatology-specific quality of life and self-compassion.Results:
      Eighty-seven participants completed the post-intervention questionnaires (51%),
      and practiced on a median of 9/14 days. Study completers demonstrated
      significant, moderate improvements on measures of stress, anxiety, depression,
      self-compassion and dermatology-specific quality of life, relative to controls.
      In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, these findings remained significant,
      however effect sizes reduced from moderate to small.Conclusions: The findings
      indicate that CFT self-help shows promise in the treatment of psychological
      distress associated with skin conditions, however further testing of the
      intervention is not feasible without significant methodological changes,
      including the method of treatment delivery. Future studies should also include a
      follow-up period, as the duration of treatment effects could not be shown.

TI  - The Role of Daily Steps in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: Secondary
      Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial of a 6-Month Internet-Based,
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Youth.
PG  - e46419
LID - 10.2196/46419 [doi]
LID - e46419
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports physical activity (PA) as an adjunctive
      treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Few studies, however, have
      examined the relationship between objectively measured PA and MDD treatment
      outcomes using prospective data. OBJECTIVE: This study is a secondary analysis of
      data from a 24-week internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy program for MDD. The purpose of this analysis was twofold: (1) to examine
      average daily step counts in relation to MDD symptom improvement, and whether
      pain moderated this relationship; and (2) to examine whether changes in step
      activity (ie, step trajectories) during treatment were associated with baseline
      symptoms and symptom improvement. METHODS: Patients from the Centre for Addiction
      and Mental Health were part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the
      effects of internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy for
      young adults (aged 18-30 years old) with MDD. Data from 20 participants who had
      completed the intervention were analyzed. PA, in the form of objectively measured
      steps, was measured using the Fitbit-HR Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc), and self-reported
      depression severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).
      Linear regression analysis was used to test PA's relationship with depression
      improvement and the moderating effect of pain severity and pain interference.
      Growth curve and multivariable regression models were used to test longitudinal
      associations. RESULTS: Participants walked an average of 8269 steps per day, and
      each additional +1000-step difference between participants was significantly
      associated with a 2.66-point greater improvement (reduction) in BDI-II,
      controlling for anxiety, pain interference, and adherence to Fitbit monitoring
      (P=.02). Pain severity appeared to moderate (reduce) the positive effect of
      average daily steps on BDI-II improvement (P=.03). Higher baseline depression and
      anxiety symptoms predicted less positive step trajectories throughout treatment
      (Ps≤.001), and more positive step trajectories early in the trial predicted
      greater MDD improvement at the end of the trial (Ps<.04). However, step
      trajectories across the full duration of the trial did not significantly predict
      MDD improvement (Ps=.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study used objective measurements to
      demonstrate positive associations between PA and depression improvement in the
      context of cognitive behavioral treatment. Pain appeared to moderate this
      relationship, and baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted PA
      trajectories. The findings inform future interventions for major depression.
      Future research with larger samples should consider additional moderators of
      PA-related treatment success and the extent to which outcomes are related to PA
      change in multimodal interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov

      Mental Illness in Denmark: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e211020
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1020 [doi]
LID - e211020
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Caregivers of people with mental illness are at increased risk of
      developing depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect
      of a compassion cultivation training (CCT) program on decreasing caregiver
      psychological distress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This
      waitlist-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2 different
      community settings in Denmark. Caregivers were excluded if they had a diagnosed
      and untreated mental illness, addiction, meditation practice, or current
      psychotherapeutic treatment. Enrollment occurred between May 2018 and March 2019.
      A repeated measurement model was used to examine the impact of the intervention.
      The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. Data analysis
      was conducted from June 4 to July 7, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were
      randomized 1-to-1 to an 8-week CCT course or waitlist control. Block
      randomization was used with 40 participants in each block. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURES: The main outcome was reduction in psychological distress, as measured
      by the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS). Baseline, postintervention, and
      3- and 6-month follow-up measurements were collected. RESULTS: Among 192
      participants assessed for eligibility, 161 participants were included in the
      study (mean [SD] age, 52.6 [12.5] years; 142 [88.2%] women), with 79 participants
      randomized to the CCT intervention and 82 participants in the waitlist control
      group. At baseline, the mean (SD) DASS scores for the intervention vs control
      groups were 10.89 (8.66) vs 10.80 (8.38) for depression, 6.89 (6.48) vs 6.68
      (5.33) for anxiety, and 14.96 (7.90) vs 15.77 (7.40) for stress. The CCT group
      experienced statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome in mean
      change from baseline vs the control group at postintervention (adjusted mean
      difference: depression, -4.16 [95% CI, -6.75 to -1.58]; P = .002; anxiety, -2.24
      [95% CI, -3.99 to -0.48]; P = .01; stress, -4.20 [95% CI, -6.73 to -1.67];
      P = .001), the 3-month follow-up (adjusted mean difference: depression, -3.78
      [95% CI, -6.40 to -1.17]; P = .005; anxiety, -2.50 [95% CI, -4.27 to -0.73];
      P = .006; stress, -3.76 [95% CI, -6.32 to -1.21]; P = .004), and the 6-month
      follow-up (adjusted mean difference: depression: -4.24 [95% CI, -6.97 to -1.52];
      P = .002; anxiety, -2.12 [95% CI, -3.96 to -0.29]; P = .02; stress: -3.79 [95%
      CI, -6.44 to -1.13]; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest
      that CCT was superior to the waitlist control in supporting caregivers' mental
      health. Statistically and clinically significant reductions in psychological
      distress were found and sustained at the 6-month follow-up. The improvements
      noted in this randomized clinical trial could serve to encourage implementation
      of future evidence-based programs for caregivers. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

      mindfulness-based cancer recovery program for underserved individuals living with
      cancer in Alberta: protocol development for a randomized wait-list controlled
      clinical trial.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-13-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated stress can exacerbate cancer symptom severity, and after
      completion of primary cancer treatments, many individuals continue to have
      significant distress. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is an 8-week group
      psychosocial intervention consisting of training in mindfulness meditation and
      yoga designed to mitigate stress, pain, and chronic illness. Efficacy research
      shows face-to-face (F2F) MBCR programs have positive benefits for cancer
      patients; however barriers exist that impede participation in F2F groups. While
      online MBCR groups are available to the public, none have been evaluated. PRIMARY
      OBJECTIVE: determine whether underserved patients are willing to participate in
      and complete an online MBCR program. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: determine whether
      online MBCR will mirror previous efficacy findings from F2F MBCR groups on
      patient-reported outcomes. METHOD/DESIGN: The study includes cancer patients in
      Alberta, exhibiting moderate distress, who do not have access to F2F MBCR.
      Participants will be randomized to either online MBCR, or waiting for the next
      available group. An anticipated sample size of 64 participants will complete
      measures online pre and post treatment or waiting period. Feasibility will be
      tracked through monitoring numbers eligible and participating through each stage
      of the protocol. DISCUSSION: 47 have completed/completing the intervention. Data
      suggest it is possible to conduct a randomized waitlist controlled trial of
      online MBCR to reach underserved cancer survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does adding psychological intervention to medical therapy improve
      nausea/vomiting, psychological symptoms, and pregnancy distress in women with
      moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Three weeks of
      medical therapy plus psychotherapy yielded statistically and clinically
      significant improvements in NVP-specific symptoms, anxiety/depression symptoms,
      and pregnancy distress, compared with medical therapy alone. WHAT IS KNOWN
      ALREADY: Pregnancy with nausea/vomiting is associated with psychiatric morbidity.
      Evidence supports the exploration of psychosocial reactions in addition to
      biochemical markers related to NVP. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This
      prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study was
      performed at two obstetrics clinics in Iran. A total of 86 women, aged 18-40
      years, between 6 and 12 weeks pregnant with moderate NVP, more than 5 years of
      education, and not currently practicing any relaxation techniques or undergoing
      any psychotherapy, were enrolled from June 2013 to November 2014.
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 86 moderate NVP women were
      randomly allocated to either a control (medical therapy alone) or experimental
      (medical therapy plus psychotherapy) group. Block randomization was achieved
      using a paper list prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in
      the trial. The experimental group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg
      daily) for 3 weeks, and also received intensive mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy (MBCT) in eight individual sessions (50 min each) over 3 weeks. The
      control group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily tablet) for 3 weeks
      alone. All participants completed the Rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and
      retching (RINVR), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the
      prenatal distress questionnaire (PDQ) at baseline, 3 weeks after baseline at the
      end of the study, and at a 1 month post-treatment follow-up. Linear mixed-effects
      models were used, in an intention-to-treat analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF
      CHANCE: In the psychotherapy plus medical therapy group, the mean relative
      difference between baseline and post-treatment decreased for RINVR; nausea 8.2
      (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1, 10.2), vomiting 3.5 (95% CI 1.5, 5.8), and
      total RINVR 11.7 (95% CI 6.5, 16.5), for HADS; anxiety 5.1 (95% CI 3.2, 9.2),
      depression 3.5 (95% CI 2.4, 7.3), total HADS 7.2 (95% CI 4.4, 12.1), for PDQ;
      birth concerns 3.3 (95% CI 1.3, 9.1), body concerns 1.5 (95% CI 0.9, 5.1),
      relationship concerns 2.1 (95% CI 1.2, 5.9), and total PDQ 5.9 (95% CI 3.5,
      10.6). At 1 month after treatment, the statistically significant improvement in
      RINVR, HADS and PDQ, as well as clinical improvement in severity of symptoms,
      persisted. Medical therapy plus psychotherapy also improved nausea/vomiting
      symptoms, psychological symptoms, and reduced pregnancy distress more than
      medical therapy alone, with an effect size of 0.42-0.72 over the trial period.
      LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The conclusions were limited to a small number
      of women with moderate NVP. It is unclear whether the difference between the
      outcomes in the different groups was related to MBCT alone, or to the extra time
      and attention paid to patients in the medical therapy plus psychotherapy. The
      participants in the study did not remain blind to the treatment and the outcome
      may only be representative of women with moderate NVP who have been referred to
      obstetrics clinics. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings show that
      adding 3 weeks of psychological intervention to medical therapy may appear to
      produce positive therapeutic outcomes upon conclusion of treatment, and 1 month
      after treatment. This suggests that psychotherapy should be considered as an
      adjunctive treatment option for women with moderate NVP. In future studies,
      however, a group of patients who are receiving placebo psychotherapy along with
      medical treatment should be included. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of the
      addition of psychological intervention to standard medical therapy would be
      useful.

TI  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of mindfulness-based Triarchic
      body-pathway relaxation technique: a pilot study.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1007/s10484-008-9050-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The "Triarchic body-pathway relaxation technique" (TBRT) is a form of
      ancient Chinese mindfulness-based meditation professed to give rise to positive
      emotions and a specific state of consciousness in which deep relaxation and
      internalized attention coexist. The purpose of this study was to examine the EEG
      pattern generated during the practice of this mindfulness exercise, and compare
      it to music listening which has been shown to induce positive emotions. METHODS:
      Nineteen college students (aged 19-22 years) participated in the study. Each
      participant listened to both the TBRT and music audiotapes while EEG was
      recorded. The order of presentation was counterbalanced to avoid order effect.
      Two EEG indicators were used: (1) alpha asymmetry index, an indicator for
      left-sided anterior activation, as measure of positive emotions, and (2) frontal
      midline theta activity, as a measure for internalized attention. RESULTS:
      Increased left-sided activation, a pattern associated with positive emotions, was
      found during both TBRT exercise and music conditions. However, only TBRT exercise
      was shown to exhibit greater frontal midline theta power, a pattern associated
      with internalized attention. CONCLUSIONS: These results provided evidence to
      support that the TBRT gives rise to positive emotional experience, accompanied by
      focused internalized attention.

TI  - A pilot and feasibility study of a randomized clinical trial testing a
      self-compassion intervention aimed to increase physical activity behaviour among
      people with prediabetes.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/s40814-022-01072-6 [doi]
LID - 111
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seventy-five per cent of individuals with prediabetes will eventually
      be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Physical activity is a cornerstone in reducing
      type 2 diabetes risk but can be a challenging behaviour to adopt for those living
      with prediabetes. Individuals with prediabetes experience difficult emotions
      associated with being at risk for a chronic disease, which can undermine
      self-regulation. Self-compassion enhances self-regulation because it mitigates
      difficult emotions and promotes adaptive coping. We performed a pilot randomized
      controlled trial to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a
      self-compassion informed intervention to increase physical activity for persons
      with prediabetes. METHODS: This explanatory mixed methods study tested the
      feasibility and acceptability of a two-arm, randomized, single-blind, actively
      controlled, 6-week online intervention. Using a 1:1 allocation ratio,
      participants (identified as people with prediabetes, low physical activity, and
      low self-compassion) were randomized to a self-compassion (M(age) = 60.22 years)
      or control condition (M(age) = 56.13 years). All participants received behaviour
      change education (e.g. SMART goals, action-coping planning) and either other
      health knowledge (control condition: e.g. sleep, benefits of water) or
      self-compassion training (intervention condition: practising mindfulness, writing
      a letter to themselves offering the same support that they would offer to a
      friend). The primary outcome was to determine the feasibility and acceptability
      of the trial. To be considered feasible, our outcomes needed to meet or surpass
      our pre-determined criteria (e.g. time for group formation: 14-20 participants
      per month). Feasibility was assessed by examining the recruitment rates,
      retention, adherence, fidelity, and capacity. Semi-structured interviews were
      conducted with participants to determine trial acceptability. As a secondary
      purpose, we examined the means on key study variables (secondary and exploratory
      variables; see Table 1) at all planned time points (baseline, intervention-end,
      6- and 12-week follow-up) to identify if they are suitable to include in the
      efficacy trial (see Additional Table 3). RESULTS: Eighteen participants were
      screened and randomized to one of two conditions. Retention, instructor fidelity,
      safety, capacity, adherence to most of the study aspects, and acceptability by
      participants and facilitators all met the criteria for feasibility. Recruitment
      rate, process time, and adherence to home practice were below our criteria, and
      we offer ways to address these shortcomings for the efficacy trial. CONCLUSION:
      The results from this study suggest that it should be feasible to deliver our
      intervention while highlighting the alterations to components that may be altered
      when delivering the efficacy trial. We outline our changes which should improve
      and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of our planned intervention.

TI  - eLIFEwithIBD: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of an online
      acceptance and commitment therapy and compassion-based intervention in
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 1369577
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1369577 [doi]
LID - 1369577
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) entails physical, psychological, and
      social burden and holds a significant impact on quality of life. Experiential
      avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have been identified as
      possible therapeutic targets for improving mental health in people with IBD.
      Traditional face-to-face psychological therapy continues to provide obstacles for
      patients seeking assistance. Online psychological therapies centered on
      acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion have been shown to improve psychological
      distress in other populations. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the study protocol
      of a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of an ACT and compassion-based,
      online intervention - eLIFEwithIBD - on the improvement of psychological
      distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception,
      illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, and self-compassion. METHODS:
      The eLIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation of the LIFEwithIBD programme
      (delivered through an in-person group format) and entails an ACT, mindfulness,
      and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered as an e-health tool
      for people with IBD. This protocol outlines the structure and contents of the
      eLIFEwithIBD intervention. Participants were recruited by an advertisement on the
      social media platforms of Portuguese Associations for IBD in January 2022. A
      psychologist conducted a brief interview with 80 patients who were interested in
      participating. Fifty-five participants were selected and randomly assigned to one
      of two conditions [experimental group (eLIFEwithIBD + medical TAU; n = 37) or
      control group (medical TAU; n = 18)]. Outcome measurement took place at baseline,
      post-intervention, and 4-month follow-up. All analyses are planned as
      intent-to-treat (ITT). RESULTS: The eLIFEwithIBD intervention is expected to
      empower people with IBD by fostering psychological strategies that promote
      illness adjustment and well-being and prevent subsequent distress. The
      eLIFEwithIBD aims to gain a novel and better understanding of the role of online
      contextual behavioral interventions on improving the quality of life and mental
      health of people with IBD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Elevated fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive
      evaluation (FPE) are thought to play key roles in the maintenance of social
      anxiety disorder (SAD). Although efficacious therapies exist for SAD, the
      potential mediating and moderating effects of FNE and FPE on social anxiety
      treatment outcome have not been examined. METHODS: This sample comprised a
      secondary analysis of 210 individuals who participated in one of three randomized
      controlled trials for the treatment of SAD. Participants were randomized to:
      individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), group CBT, community
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), group MBSR, or they were randomized to
      waitlist and offered treatment after waitlist. Assessments were completed pre-
      and post-treatment/waitlist and, for the treatment groups, at three-month
      follow-up. RESULTS: CBT and MBSR led to greater reductions in FNE and FPE than
      waitlist, with CBT more efficacious in reducing FPE than MBSR. For both CBT (vs.
      waitlist) and MBSR (vs. waitlist), there were significant indirect effects on
      post-treatment social anxiety through both FNE and FPE, and the indirect effect
      through FPE was greater for CBT than MBSR. However, in the fully longitudinal
      model testing mediation, CBT and MBSR were not differentially mediated by FPE.
      Baseline FNE and FPE each moderated CBT treatment outcome compared to waitlist -
      higher baseline FNE and FPE were associated with higher baseline social anxiety
      and greater reductions in social anxiety during CBT. DISCUSSION: FNE and FPE
      contributed in sometimes similar and sometimes distinct ways to the mediation and
      moderation of psychosocial approaches for treating SAD. This supports the
      importance of distinguishing between fears of negative and positive evaluation in
      the assessment and treatment of SAD.

      compared to a relaxation program and teaching as usual in schools: A
      cluster-randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) have shown promising effects
      on mental health among children and adolescents, but high-quality studies
      examining the topic are lacking. The present study assessed the effects of MBI on
      mental health in school-setting in an extensive randomised controlled trial.
      METHODS: Finnish school children and adolescents (N = 3519), aged 12-15 years
      (6th to 8th graders), from 56 schools were randomized into a 9 week MBI group,
      and control groups with a relaxation program or teaching as usual. The primary
      outcomes were resilience, socio-emotional functioning, and depressive symptoms at
      baseline, at completion of the programs at 9 weeks (T9), and at follow-up at 26
      weeks (T26). RESULTS: Overall, mindfulness did not show more beneficial effects
      on the primary outcomes compared to the controls except for resilience for which
      a positive intervention effect was found at T9 in all participants (β=1.18, SE
      0.57, p = 0.04) as compared to the relaxation group. In addition, in gender and
      grade related analyses, MBI lowered depressive symptoms in girls at T26 (β=-0.49,
      SE 0.21, p = 0.02) and improved socio-emotional functioning at T9 (β=-1.37, SE
      0.69, p = 0.049) and at T26 (β=-1.71, SE 0.73, p = 0.02) among 7th graders as
      compared to relaxation. LIMITATIONS: The inactive control group was smaller than
      the intervention and active control groups, reducing statistical power.
      CONCLUSIONS: A short 9-week MBI in school-setting provides slight benefits over a
      relaxation program and teaching as usual. Future research should investigate
      whether embedding regular mindfulness-based practice in curriculums could
      intensify the effects.

AB  - The global population is aging while modern healthcare systems are responding
      with limited success to the growing care demands of the senior population.
      Capitalizing on recent technological advancements, new ways to improve older
      adults' quality of life have recently been implemented. The current study
      investigated, from a qualitative point of view, the utility of a
      mindfulness-based smartphone application for older adults. A description of the
      older adults' experience with the smartphone application designed to enhance
      well-being and mindfulness will be presented. Participants'general beliefs about
      the benefits of technology for personal well-being will also be discussed. 68
      older adults were recruited from different education centers for seniors.
      Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: a) a treatment group, which
      received the smartphone application intervention (n = 34), or b) a waitlist
      control group (n = 34). The experimental intervention included the utilization of
      a smartphone app designed specifically for improving older adult well-being and
      mindfulness levels. Participants completed semi-structured interviews evaluating
      participants' treatment experience and technology-acceptance at recruitment (T0,
      baseline) and post-intervention (T1, post-intervention). Through thematic
      analysis, four themes were identified from verbatim responses of both interviews:
      Utility of technology for health, Impressions of technology, Mindful-benefits of
      smartphone application usage, and Smartphone application usage as a means to
      improve interpersonal relationships. Participants showed a positive experience of
      the app intervention. Qualitative analysis underlined the main
      Mindfulness-benefits reported by participants and the potentially crucial role of
      "Langerian" mindfulness in the relationship between older adults and health
      technology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine immune
      recovery following breast cancer (BC) therapy and evaluate the effect of
      mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy (MBSR) on immune recovery with
      emphasis on lymphocyte subsets, T cell activation, and production of T-helper 1
      (Th1; interferon [IFN]-γ) and T-helper 2 (Th2; interleukin-4 [IL-4]) cytokines.
      METHOD: Participants who completed the study consisted of 82 patients diagnosed
      with Stage 0-III BC, who received lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation ±
      chemotherapy. Patients were randomized into an MBSR(BC) intervention program or a
      control (usual care) group. Immune cell measures were assessed at baseline and
      within 2 weeks after the 6-week intervention. The numbers and percentages of
      lymphocyte subsets, activated T cells, and Th1 and Th2 cells in peripheral blood
      samples were determined by immunostaining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immune
      subset recovery after cancer treatment showed positive associations with time
      since treatment completion. The B and natural killer (NK) cells were more
      susceptible than T cells in being suppressed by cancer treatment. Women who
      received MBSR(BC) had T cells more readily activated by the mitogen
      phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and an increase in the Th1/Th2 ratio. Activation was
      also higher for the MBSR(BC) group if <12 weeks from the end of treatment and
      women in MBSR(BC) <12 weeks had higher T cell count for CD4(+). CONCLUSION:
      MBSR(BC) promotes a more rapid recovery of functional T cells capable of being
      activated by a mitogen with the Th1 phenotype, whereas substantial recovery of B
      and NK cells after completion of cancer treatment appears to occur independent of
      stress-reducing interventions.

      Hyperactivity Disorder: Mindfulness as a Useful Treatment Modality.
PG  - 425-431
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000682 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a structured
      mindfulness group intervention program targeting deficient emotional
      self-regulation (DESR) in a sample of children with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: Seventy-two children aged 7 to 12 years
      with ADHD were randomized into 2 groups (mindfulness and control). The
      dysregulation profile was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)
      Attention/Anxiety-Depression/Aggression scales. RESULTS: Children with ADHD who
      received mindfulness-based group therapy showed lower levels of DESR after
      treatment, with a reduction in CBCL dysregulation profile (F (1,63) = 4.81; p =
      0.032). All ADHD symptoms showed a moderately significant positive correlation
      with DESR (p < 0.01). Children with combined-type showed higher levels of DESR
      than children with inattentive-type (p = 0.018); however, no statistically
      significant changes were observed in the combined-type after mindfulness
      treatment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mindfulness in the form of
      structured group therapy might be clinically relevant in treating children with
      ADHD and thus make an impact on the overall clinical outcome, regardless of the
      ADHD subtype.

AB  - As one of the frontline professionals during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,
      social workers can face tremendous pressure, which can lead to mental health
      problems. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a brief
      mindfulness-based intervention had short- and middle-term effects on social
      workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a randomized controlled trial,
      49 social workers were assigned to an experimental group (n = 28) or a waitlist
      control group (n = 21). The intervention was a four-week mindfulness-based
      program. The outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-test, and at
      one-month follow-up test. At post-test and follow-up, the workers in the
      experimental group reported higher mean scores in psychological flexibility and
      self-compassion and lower mean scores in depression compared to the workers in
      the waitlist control group. Although the experimental group also showed lower
      mean scores than the waitlist control group in anxiety and stress at both
      post-test and follow, the differences were not statistically significant. The
      findings suggest that a brief mindfulness-based intervention can improve
      psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and depression in social workers
      working during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to protected mental health, adding
      support to continuing development of such efficient mindfulness-based programs.
      Future studies should use larger samples and examine brief interventions' working
      mechanisms. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary

LID - CD007030
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common and distressing problem after
      stroke. The best ways to prevent or treat PSF are uncertain. Several different
      interventions can be argued to have a rational basis. OBJECTIVES: To determine
      whether, among people with stroke, any intervention reduces the proportion of
      people with fatigue, fatigue severity, or both; and to determine the effect of
      intervention on health-related quality of life, disability, dependency and death,
      and whether such intervention is cost effective. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
      Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2014), Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE
      (1950 to May 2014), EMBASE (1980 to May 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014), AMED
      (1985 to May 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2014), Digital Dissertations (1861 to
      May 2014), British Nursing Index (1985 to May 2014), PEDro (searched May 2014)
      and PsycBITE (searched May 2014). We also searched four ongoing trials
      registries, scanned reference lists, performed citation tracking of included
      trials and contacted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors
      independently scrutinised all titles and abstracts and excluded obviously
      irrelevant studies. We obtained the full texts for potentially relevant studies
      and three review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria. We
      included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an intervention with a
      control, or compared different interventions for PSF. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of
      bias for each included trial. The primary outcomes were severity of fatigue, or
      proportion of people with fatigue after treatment. We performed separate analyses
      for trials investigating efficacy in treating PSF, trials investigating efficacy
      in preventing PSF and trials not primarily investigating efficacy in PSF but
      which reported fatigue as an outcome. We pooled results from trials that had a
      control arm. For trials that compared different potentially active interventions
      without a control arm, we performed analyses for individual trials without
      pooling.We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) as the effect size for
      continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled the
      results using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity using the I(2)
      statistic. We performed separate subgroup analyses for pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological interventions. We also performed sensitivity analyses to
      assess the influence of methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved 12,490
      citations, obtained full texts for 58 studies and included 12 trials (three from
      the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 participants. Eight
      trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials
      with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five
      pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a
      combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions: a
      fatigue education programme and a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme).
      The fatigue severity was lower in the intervention groups than in the control
      groups (244 participants, pooled SMD -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.93 to
      -0.21), with significant heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 87%, degrees of
      freedom (df) = 6, P value < 0.00001). The beneficial effect was not seen in
      trials that had used adequate allocation concealment (two trials, 89
      participants, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.04) or trials that had used adequate
      blinding of outcome assessors (four trials, 198 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI
      -2.31 to 0.11).No trial primarily investigated the efficacy in preventing
      PSF.Four trials (248 participants) did not primarily investigate the efficacy on
      fatigue but other symptoms after stroke. None of these interventions showed any
      benefit on reducing PSF, which included tirilazad mesylate, continuous positive
      airway pressure for sleep apnoea, antidepressants and a self management programme
      for recovery from chronic diseases. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient
      evidence on the efficacy of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue after
      stroke. Trials to date have been small and heterogeneous, and some have had a
      high risk of bias. Some of the interventions described were feasible in people
      with stroke, but their efficacy should be investigated in RCTs with a more robust
      study design and adequate sample sizes.

TI  - Yoga-Based Group Intervention for In-patients With Schizophrenia Spectrum
      Disorders-A Qualitative Approach.
PG  - 715670
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.715670 [doi]
LID - 715670
AB  - Background: Yoga may pose a promising complementary therapy in the multimodal
      treatment of in-patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, to
      date, no studies have qualitatively examined in-patients' with SSD experiences of
      Yoga as well as their perceptions of its limitations and benefits as a treatment
      component. This qualitative study aimed to explore for the first time the
      mechanisms and processes of Yoga-based Group Intervention (YoGI) for in-patients
      with SSD in Germany by asking for their subjective experiences. Findings could
      serve as a preliminary basis for developing an effective and evidence-based YoGI
      manual tailored to this patient group. Materials and Methods: In total, 25
      semi-structured interviews were conducted directly after YoGI, for which
      responses were either noted down by hand or audio-recorded. The interview guide
      was pilot-tested and consisted of 14 questions to explore the personal
      articulated experiences of participation in YoGI from in-patients with SSD.
      Positive, negative, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were assessed during a
      diagnostic interview and through questionnaires. The interview data was
      transcribed, coded by two independent researchers, and analysed using an
      inductive thematic approach. The research team collaboratively discussed emerging
      categories to reduce redundancy and form meaningful themes and subthemes.
      Results: The analysis revealed seven main themes. YoGI was perceived as feasible
      and focusing on individual adaptation, captured by the theme inclusivity.
      Nevertheless, participants encountered challenges; thus, physical limitations
      need to be considered. While practising together, participants experienced
      interconnectedness and developed a mindful stance as they accepted their
      limitations and adapted exercises with self-compassion. Patients described that
      following the flow of the asanas required physical persistence, which ultimately
      led many participants to experience confidence and relaxation. YoGI affected
      symptom representation as heightened awareness led participants to notice
      impeding as well as improved symptoms. Conclusion: YoGI showed various promising
      effects on in-patients with SSD. Future research should examine to what extent
      these effects can be sustained and how the mindful approach during YoGI can be
      transferred to areas outside the Yoga class. Furthermore, a randomised controlled
      trial could investigate the effectiveness of a manualised YoGI.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The primary objective of this study was to examine the effects of a
      bespoke and innovative six-week online Mindfulness-based Social Work and
      Self-Care (MBSWSC) programme on the stress, feelings of burnout, anxiety,
      depression, and well-being of a sample of social workers. This secondary
      objective was to examine the effectiveness of MBSWSC at improving a number of
      potentially important mindfulness-based programme mechanisms of action, including
      mindfulness, attention regulation (decentering), acceptance, self-compassion,
      non-attachment, aversion, worry and rumination. A randomised controlled trial
      with repeated measures (pre-post intervention) was conducted to evaluate the
      effects of MBSWSC against an active control. The active control was a modified
      mindfulness-based programme which focussed on supporting increases in mindfulness
      and self-compassion in social workers with a view to improving the same primary
      study outcomes. Sixty-two participants were randomly allocated to MBSWSC (n = 33)
      or the active control (n = 29). When compared to the active control group, the
      MBSWSC programme was found to be significantly superior at improving stress,
      emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and depression. MBSWSC was also superior to the
      active control at improving acceptance, mindfulness, non-attachment, attention
      regulation (decentering) and worry of the social workers in this study. The
      results suggest that MBSWSC is a very useful therapeutic programme, which has the
      capacity to improve a range of important mental health and well-being outcomes
      for social workers. The results also indicate that the MBSWSC programme has the
      capacity to improve a range of important mindfulness-based mechanisms of action.

TI  - Complementary and integrative health approaches to manage chronic pain in U.S.
      military populations: Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis,
      1985-2019.
PG  - 295-309
LID - 10.1037/ser0000417 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of complementary and
      integrative health (CIH) approaches for reducing pain intensity (primary outcome)
      and depressive symptoms (secondary outcome) as well as improving physical
      functioning (secondary outcome) among U.S. military personnel living with chronic
      pain. Studies were retrieved from bibliographic databases, databases of funded
      research, and reference sections of relevant articles. Studies that (a) evaluated
      a CIH approach to promote chronic pain management among military personnel, (b)
      used a randomized controlled trial design, and (c) assessed pain intensity were
      included. Two coders extracted data from each study and calculated effect sizes.
      Discrepancies between coders were resolved through discussion. Comprehensive
      searches identified 12 studies (k = 15 interventions) that met inclusion
      criteria. CIH practices included cognitive-behavioral therapies (k = 5), positive
      psychology (k = 3), yoga (k = 2), acupuncture (k = 2), mindfulness-based
      interventions (k = 2), and biofeedback (k = 1). Across these studies,
      participants who received the intervention reported greater reductions in pain
      intensity (d+ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.21, 0.67], k = 15) compared to controls.
      Statistically significant improvements were also observed for physical
      functioning (d+ = 0.36, 95% CI [0.11, 0.61], k = 11) but not for depressive
      symptoms (d+ = 0.21, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.57], k = 8). CIH approaches reduced pain
      intensity and improved physical functioning. These approaches offer a
      nonpharmacological, nonsurgical intervention for chronic pain management for
      military personnel. Future studies should optimize interventions to improve
      depressive symptoms in military populations experiencing chronic pain. (PsycInfo

TI  - Teaching Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Self-Compassion (TADS) to Reduce
      Diabetes Distress: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e53935
LID - 10.2196/53935 [doi]
LID - e53935
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescents living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience
      diabetes distress (DD), a construct distinct from depression or anxiety that
      refers to the negative emotions that arise from living with and managing
      diabetes. Self-compassion, which involves being open to one's own suffering and
      treating oneself with the same care one would show to loved ones, is associated
      with better psychological and clinical outcomes among individuals with T1D.
      Self-compassion is a skill that can be taught and therefore represents an
      opportunity for intervention. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to
      assess the effectiveness of a web-based mindful self-compassion for teens (MSC-T)
      intervention on improving DD, anxiety, depression, diabetes-related disordered
      eating, and suicidal ideation experienced by youth with T1D (aged between 12 and
      17 years) compared with a waitlist control group (standard of care). We will also
      explore (1) if the effect of the MSC-T intervention changes over time, (2) if the
      MSC-T intervention has a positive impact on measures of glycemic control, and (3)
      if the effect of the MSC-T intervention differs based on self-reported gender.
      METHODS: We will conduct a single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled
      trial of 140 adolescents with T1D followed for 12 months. Participants will be
      randomly allocated (using hidden allocation) in a 1:1 ratio to either the MSC-T
      intervention or the waitlist control group. Our primary outcome is DD, as
      measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes-Teen (PAID-T) version at 3 months.
      Secondary outcomes, assessed at 3 and 12 months, include anxiety (Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale), depression (Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), diabetes-related disordered eating (Diabetes Eating
      Problem Survey-Revised [DEPS-R] version), and suicidal ideation (using 1 question
      from the PHQ-9). RESULTS: Study recruitment began in October 2022 and was
      completed in March 2023, with a total of 141 participants enrolling. Data
      collection will be ongoing until March 2024. The first results are expected in
      June 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be the first randomized trial to assess
      the effectiveness of the web-based MSC-T intervention on adolescents with T1D.
      Given that adolescence is a period where individuals are typically required to
      assume more responsibility for their diabetes care, providing adolescents with
      the tools they need to better manage the stress that often accompanies T1D
      management is paramount. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05463874;

TI  - Systematic Review for the Medical Applications of Meditation in Randomized
      Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031244 [doi]
LID - 1244
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meditation has been increasingly adapted for healthy populations and
      participants with diseases. Its beneficial effects are still challenging to
      determine due to the heterogeneity and methodological obstacles regarding medical
      applications. This study aimed to integrate the features of therapeutic
      meditation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We conducted a
      systematic review of RCTs with meditation for populations with diseases using the
      PubMed database through June 2021. We analyzed the characteristics of the
      diseases/disorders, participants, measurements, and their overall benefits.
      RESULTS: Among a total of 4855 references, 104 RCTs were determined and mainly
      applied mindfulness-based (51 RCTs), yoga-based (32 RCTs), and transcendental
      meditation (14 RCTs) to 10,139 patient-participants. These RCTs were conducted
      for participants with a total of 45 kinds of disorders; the most frequent being
      cancer, followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases and affective
      mood disorder. Seven symptoms or signs were frequently assessed: depressive mood,
      feeling anxious, quality of life, stress, sleep, pain, and fatigue. The RCTs
      showed a higher ratio of positive outcomes for sleep (73.9%) and fatigue (68.4%).
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review produced the comprehensive features of RCTs
      for therapeutic meditation. These results will help physicians and researchers
      further study clinical adaptations in the future as reference data.

TI  - Mindfulness and compassion-based programs on eating behavior of post-bariatric
      surgery patients: A two phased clinical trial protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Weight regain after bariatric surgery remains a relevant and
      worrisome topic, requiring greater understanding and involvement in research into
      new adjuvant treatments. This study aims to compare the preliminary effectiveness
      and feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and Attachment-Based
      Compassion Therapy programs as opposed to usual treatments (workshops) on the
      eating behavior of patients with progressive weight gain after bariatric surgery
      in Brazilian patients at a private clinic. It was hypothesized that both
      interventions are feasible and that the self-compassion program may be more
      effective than the mindfulness program. METHODS: The study will be divided into
      two phases: a cross-analytical study of those who underwent bariatric surgery and
      a randomized controlled trial only with the ones who had weight regain.
      Interventions will be conducted for eight weeks synchronously with three
      assessment points (baseline, post intervention, and 6-month follow-up), both
      online. The primary outcome will be a change in eating behavior. Secondary
      outcomes will include improved quality of life, enhanced body image satisfaction
      and reduced distortion (Brazilian Silhouette Scales for adults), better weight
      management (maintenance or weight reduction), increased frequency of activity and
      monitoring with the surgery team. Qualitative data will also be collected by
      online identification of a sub-sample of participants. RESULTS: Improvements are
      expected in eating behavior, weight, reverse progressive weight gain,
      classification of self-image, quality of life, and levels of mindfulness,
      self-compassion, and anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study seeks to gather preliminary
      evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness and compassion training for the
      adjunctive treatment of progressive weight gain in post-bariatric patients.

TI  - Cognitive Behavior Therapy vs Mindfulness in Treatment of Prolonged Grief
      Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 646-654
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.0432 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Although grief-focused cognitive behavior therapies are the most
      empirically supported treatment for prolonged grief disorder, many people find
      this treatment difficult. A viable alternative for treatment is mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative efficacies of grief-focused
      cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to reduce
      prolonged grief disorder severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A
      single-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial was conducted among adults aged
      18 to 70 years with prolonged grief disorder, as defined in the International
      Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, and assessed by clinical interview
      based on the Prolonged Grief-13 (PG-13) scale. Those with severe suicidal risk,
      presence of psychosis, or substance dependence were excluded. Between November
      2012 and November 2022, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to eleven
      90-minute sessions of grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy or
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy at a traumatic stress clinic in Sydney,
      Australia, with follow-up through 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received
      once-weekly 90-minute individual sessions for 11 weeks. Grief-focused cognitive
      behavior therapy comprised 5 sessions of recalling memories of the deceased, plus
      cognitive restructuring and planning future social and positive activities.
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy comprised mindfulness exercises adapted to
      tolerate grief-related distress. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome
      was change in prolonged grief disorder severity measured by the PG-13 scale
      assessed at baseline, 1 week posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment (primary
      outcome time point), as well as secondary outcome measures of depression,
      anxiety, grief-related cognition, and quality of life. RESULTS: The trial
      included 100 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [13.4] years; 87 [87.0%] female),
      50 in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy condition and 50 in the
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy condition. Linear mixed models indicated that
      at the 6-month assessment, participants in the grief-focused cognitive behavior
      therapy group showed greater reduction in PG-13 scale score relative to those in
      the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group (mean difference, 7.1; 95% CI,
      1.6-12.5; P = .01), with a large between-group effect size (0.8; 95% CI,
      0.2-1.3). Participants in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy group also
      demonstrated greater reductions in depression as measured on the Beck Depression
      Inventory than those in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group (mean
      difference, 6.6; 95% CI, 0.5-12.9; P = .04) and grief-related cognition (mean
      difference, 14.4; 95% CI, 2.8-25.9; P = .02). There were no other significant
      differences between treatment groups and no reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS
      AND RELEVANCE: In this study, grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy conferred
      more benefit for core prolonged grief disorder symptoms and associated problems 6
      months after treatment than mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Although both
      treatments may be considered for prolonged grief disorder, grief-focused
      cognitive behavior therapy might be the more effective choice, taking all factors
      into consideration. TRIAL REGISTRATION: anzctr.org.au Identifier:

TI  - A Component Analysis of the Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS)
      Program for Mindful Parenting by Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder.
PG  - 463-475
LID - 10.1007/s12671-020-01376-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) has been shown to
      be effective in reducing stress and burnout in parents and professional
      caregivers of children and adolescents with intellectual and developmental
      disabilities (IDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of this study was
      to assess the comparative effects of the mindfulness (MB) and positive behavior
      support (PBS) components against the MBPBS program for mindful parenting.
      METHODS: The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with
      a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years
      of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly
      assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training
      specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the
      mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological
      stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e.,
      aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers' requests). RESULTS:
      Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived
      psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no
      significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the
      children's aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with
      most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition,
      respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to
      mothers' requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then
      PBS. Changes across all variables for both mothers and their children were
      maintained for 3 years post-intervention. After time and training type were
      controlled for, meditation time was a significant predictor in reducing
      aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and in enhancing compliance of the
      children with mothers' requests. CONCLUSIONS: Positive outcomes for mothers and
      their children with ASD were significantly greater in the MBPBS condition,
      followed by the MB condition, and least in the PBS condition. MBPBS appears to be
      an effective mindful parenting program on the assessed variables.

TI  - A Novel Mindful-Compassion Art-Based Therapy for Reducing Burnout and Promoting
      Resilience Among Healthcare Workers: Findings From a Waitlist Randomized Control
      Trial.

AB  - Protecting the mental health of healthcare workers is an urgent global public
      health priority. Healthcare workers, especially those immersed in palliative
      care, are prone to burnout due to the intense emotions associated with
      end-of-life caregiving. This study examines the efficacy of a novel, multimodal,
      and group-based Mindful-Compassion Art-based Therapy (MCAT) that integrates
      reflective self-awareness with creative emotional expression for protecting
      healthcare workers' mental health. A dual-arm open-label waitlist randomized
      controlled trial was conducted. A total of 56 healthcare workers were recruited
      from the largest homecare hospice in Singapore and randomized to the
      immediate-treatment condition of a standardized 6-week, 18-hours MCAT
      intervention (n=29), or the waitlist-control condition (n=27). Self-administered
      outcome measures on burnout, resilience, emotional regulation, self-compassion,
      death attitudes, and quality of life were collected at baseline,
      post-intervention/second-baseline at 6weeks, and follow-up/post-intervention at
      12weeks. Results from mixed model ANOVAs reveal that treatment group participants
      experienced significant reduction in mental exhaustion, as well as significant
      improvements in overall emotional regulation, nonreactivity to intrusive
      thoughts, approach acceptance of death, and afterlife belief as compared to
      waitlist-control immediately after MCAT completion. Effect sizes of these impacts
      ranged from medium to large (η (2)=0.65 to 0.170). Results from one-way ANOVAs
      further reveal that the treatment gains of reduced mental exhaustion and
      increased emotional regulation were maintained among treatment group participants
      at 12-weeks follow-up compared to baseline, with new benefits identified. These
      include increased ability to observe and describe one's experiences, elevated
      overall self-compassion, greater mindful awareness, enhanced common humanity, and
      better quality of life. Effect sizes of these impacts were large (η (2)=0.128 to
      0.298). These findings reflect the robust effectiveness and positive residual
      effects of MCAT for reducing burnout, building resilience, nurturing compassion,
      fostering collegial support, and promoting mental wellness among healthcare
      workers. The clinical model and applicability of MCAT in larger and more diverse
      caregiving contexts, such as family dementia care, are discussed. Clinical Trial

TI  - Psychological interventions for people with psychotic experiences: A systematic
      review and meta-analysis of controlled and uncontrolled effectiveness and
      economic studies.
PG  - 673-695

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many people with psychotic experiences do not develop psychotic
      disorders, yet those who seek help demonstrate high clinical complexity and poor
      outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological interventions for people
      with psychotic experiences. METHOD: We searched 13 databases for studies of
      psychological interventions for adults with psychotic experiences, but not
      psychotic disorders. Our outcomes were the proportion of participants remitting
      from psychotic experiences (primary); changes in positive and negative psychotic
      symptoms, depression, anxiety, functioning, distress, and quality of life; and
      economic outcomes (secondary). We analysed results using multilevel
      random-effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 27
      reports met inclusion criteria. In general, there was no strong evidence for the
      superiority of any one intervention. Five studies reported on our primary
      outcome, though only two reports provided randomised controlled trial evidence
      that psychological intervention (specifically, cognitive behavioural therapy)
      promoted remission from psychotic experiences. For secondary outcomes, we could
      only meta-analyse trials of cognitive behavioural therapy. We found that
      cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than treatment as usual for
      reducing distress (pooled standardised mean difference: -0.24; 95% confidence
      interval = [-0.37, -0.10]), but no more effective than the control treatment for
      improving any other outcome. Individual reports indicated that cognitive
      behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, sleep cognitive
      behavioural therapy, systemic therapy, cognitive remediation therapy, and
      supportive treatments improved at least one clinical or functional outcome. Four
      reports included economic evaluations, which suggested cognitive behavioural
      therapy may be cost-effective compared with treatment as usual. CONCLUSION: Our
      meta-analytic findings were primarily null, with the exception that cognitive
      behavioural therapy may reduce the distress associated with psychotic
      experiences. Our analyses were limited by scarcity of studies, small samples and
      variable study quality. Several intervention frameworks showed preliminary
      evidence of positive outcomes; however, the paucity of consistent evidence for
      clinical and functional improvement highlights a need for further research into
      psychological treatments for psychotic experiences. PROSPERO PROTOCOL

AB  - Healthcare workers play a critical role in the health of a nation, yet rates of
      healthcare worker stress are disproportionately high. We evaluated whether
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for life (MBCT-L), could reduce stress in
      healthcare workers and target a range of secondary outcomes. Method: This is the
      first parallel randomised controlled trial of MBCT-L. Participants were NHS
      workers, who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either MBCT-L or wait-list.
      The primary outcome was self-reported stress at post-intervention. Secondary
      variables were well-being, depression, anxiety, and work-related outcomes. Mixed
      regressions were used. Mindfulness and self/other-compassion were explored as
      potential mechanisms of effects on stress and wellbeing. Results: We assigned 234
      participants to MBCT-L (n = 115) or to wait-list (n = 119). 168 (72%)
      participants completed the primary outcome and of those who started the MBCT-L
      73.40% (n = 69) attended the majority of the sessions. MBCT-L ameliorated stress
      compared with controls (B = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.63‒3.56; d = -0.72; p < .0001).
      Effects were also found for well-being, depression and anxiety, but not for
      work-related outcomes. Mindfulness and self-compassion mediated effects on stress
      and wellbeing. Conclusions: MBCT-L could be an effective and acceptable part of a
      wider healthcare workers well-being and mental health strategy.

TI  - Taking the edge off: a feasibility randomized controlled trial of an online
      mindfulness-based intervention to reduce suspiciousness/paranoia in high positive
      schizotypy.
PG  - 1380077
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1380077 [doi]
LID - 1380077
AB  - Positive schizotypy can uniquely predict the development of psychosis with
      suspiciousness/paranoia having emerged as a key risk factor, pointing to
      significant worth in reducing this aspect in individuals with high positive
      schizotypy. Reduced paranoia in the general population following brief online
      mindfulness training has been previously reported. This study investigated the
      feasibility of a 40-day online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) (n = 12) in
      the individuals with high positive schizotypy characterized by high
      suspiciousness/paranoia and to estimate its effect on paranoia as compared with
      an active control condition using reflective journaling (n = 12). The outcome
      measures were self-reported trait and VR-induced state paranoia, completed at
      baseline, after 10 days and post-intervention. The feasibility criteria included
      retention, adherence, engagement, and acceptability. There was 100% retention,
      excellent adherence to content and engagement, with an average MBI session
      completion rate of 91%. Acceptability, indexed by a self-rated motivation to
      continue practice post-intervention, was also high. No MBI effect on trait
      paranoia was observed; however, the MBI group showed a reduction in the
      VR-induced state paranoia with a medium-to-large effect (d = 0.63). The findings
      support conducting larger-scale randomized controlled trials to evaluate the
      effects of online MBIs on reducing suspiciousness/paranoia to mitigate psychosis
      risk in individuals with high positive schizotypy. Clinical Trial

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading cause of disability and the conventional
      management has several limitations. Recent studies demonstrated the benefits of
      yoga in psychological disorders. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of the Integrated
      Yoga Module (IYM) to standard care with added yogic education on lifestyle
      modification (YELM) in patients with clinical depression. METHODS: A PROBE trial
      was conducted at a single tertiary care hospital in India. Adults aged 18 to 64
      with clinical depression were randomized to either an IYM or an active control
      group using a computer-generated mixed block randomization sequence. Both groups
      received YELM in addition to standard care and the intervention group practiced
      IYM, for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the reduction in depression symptoms
      assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and secondary outcomes
      involved self-compassion, brief resilience, positive and negative experiences,
      and quality of life, evaluated at 8 weeks. RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of
      participants was 32.2 ± 10.0 and 54.3% were females. The IYM group showed
      statistically significant improvements in BDI-II scores β = -6.7 (95% CI [-10.8,
      -2.5]; p = .001), resilience β = 0.4 (95% CI [0.02, 0.80]; p = .037), physical
      health domain of WHOQOL - BREF β = 10.1 (95% CI [0.7, 19.5]; p = .035) and
      negative emotions (SPANE-N) β = 2.8 (95% CI [0.1, 5.4]; p = .037). However, no
      significant differences were found in SCS-SF β = -0.3 (95% CI [-0.7, 0.0];
      p = .053). CONCLUSIONS: IYM as an adjunct is superior to conventional medical
      management in reducing symptoms and improving positive psychological resources in
      clinical depression.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the role of mindfulness and mindfulness-based
      interventions to optimize recovery from a substance use disorder (SUD). However,
      relatively little is known about the theory-based psychological and social
      pathways whereby mindfulness could have beneficial effects for managing a
      chronic, relapsing SUD. Informed by Revised Stress and Coping Theory, the present
      cross-sectional study examined affective, cognitive, and social pathways whereby
      mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. A total of 161
      HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using sexual minority men completed a screening
      visit for a randomized controlled trial. Using a hybrid structural equation
      model, we examined pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower
      methamphetamine craving. We found that greater mindfulness was directly
      associated with lower negative affect and higher positive affect as well as
      indirectly associated with less methamphetamine craving. Interestingly, the
      indirect association between mindfulness and methamphetamine craving appeared to
      be uniquely attributable to positive affect. Only positive affect was indirectly
      associated with lower methamphetamine craving via higher positive re-appraisal
      coping and greater self-efficacy for managing triggers for methamphetamine use.
      Methamphetamine craving was supported by moderate associations with greater
      substance use severity and more frequent methamphetamine use. These findings
      support the role of mindfulness in cultivating positive affect, which could be
      crucial to build the capacity of individuals to manage methamphetamine craving as
      a chronic stressor that threatens recovery from SUD.

TI  - Can Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Build Cognitive Reserve and Learn
      Mindfulness Meditation? Qualitative Theme Analyses from a Small Pilot Study.
PG  - 825-842

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: High levels of chronic stress negatively impact the
      hippocampus and are associated with increased incidence of mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. While mindfulness meditation may
      mitigate the effects of chronic stress, it is uncertain if adults with MCI have
      the capacity to learn mindfulness meditation. METHODS: 14 adults with MCI were
      randomized 2:1 to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a wait-list
      control group. We conducted qualitative interviews with those who completed MBSR.
      Transcribed interviews were: a) coded using an emergent themes inductive approach
      informed by grounded theory; b) rated 0-10, with higher scores reflecting greater
      perceived benefit from, and understanding of, mindfulness meditation. Ratings
      were correlated with daily home practice times and baseline level of cognitive
      function. RESULTS: Seven themes emerged from the interviews: positive perceptions
      of class; development of mindfulness skills, including meta-cognition; importance
      of the group experience; enhanced well-being; shift in MCI perspective; decreased
      stress reactivity and increased relaxation; improvement in interpersonal skills.
      Ratings of perceived benefit and understanding ranged from 2-10 (mean = 7) and of
      0-9.5 (mean = 6), respectively. Many participants experienced substantial
      benefit/understanding, some had moderate, and a few had minimal
      benefit/understanding. Understanding the key concepts of mindfulness was highly
      positively correlated with ≥20 minutes/day of home practice (r = 0.90) but not
      with baseline cognitive function (r = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Most adults with MCI
      were able to learn mindfulness meditation and had improved MCI acceptance,
      self-efficacy, and social engagement. Cognitive reserve may be enhanced through a
      mindfulness meditation program even in patients with MCI.

TI  - Assessing feasibility and acceptability of yoga and group CBT for adolescents
      with depression: A pilot randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 525-540
LID - 10.1177/13591045221092885 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Given increasing rates of depression in adolescents, there is a clear
      need for innovative treatments. In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we
      assessed acceptability and feasibility of two group-based interventions: yoga and
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The goal of this work is to prepare for a
      future fully powered randomized trial to test the hypothesis that yoga is not
      inferior to an established adolescent depression treatment, namely, group CBT.
      METHODS: We enrolled 42 adolescents with elevated depression symptoms.
      Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week group-based intervention, yoga
      or CBT. We had a priori feasibility and acceptability targets, including for
      recruitment rate, retention rate, expectancy, credibility, program satisfaction,
      class attendance, engagement in home practice, and instructor/leader manual
      adherence. We assessed adverse events, and within-subject changes in outcomes
      (depression, anxiety, impairment, sleep disturbance) and possible mediators
      (mindfulness, self-compassion). RESULTS: Both interventions met most
      acceptability and feasibility targets. The only target not met related to low
      engagement in home practice. Participants within each study arm showed decreased
      depression symptoms over time and increased self-compassion. CONCLUSIONS: A yoga
      intervention appears to be acceptable and feasible to adolescents with
      depression. However, it may be challenging for this group to engage in
      unstructured home practice.

TI  - Mindfulness instruction for HIV-infected youth: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 688-695
LID - 10.1080/09540121.2017.1394434 [doi]
AB  - HIV-infected youth experience many stressors, including stress related to their
      illness, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Therefore,
      there is a significant need to identify potentially effective interventions to
      improve stress management, coping, and self-regulation. The object of the study
      was to assess the effect of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program
      compared to an active control group on psychological symptoms and HIV disease
      management in youth utilizing a randomized controlled trial. Seventy-two
      HIV-infected adolescents, ages 14-22 (mean age 18.71 years), were enrolled from
      two urban clinics and randomized to MBSR or an active control. Data were
      collected on mindfulness, stress, self-regulation, psychological symptoms,
      medication adherence, and cognitive flexibility at baseline, post-program, and
      3-month follow-up. CD4+ T lymphocyte and HIV viral load (HIV VL) counts were also
      pulled from medical records. HIV-infected youth in the MBSR group reported higher
      levels of mindfulness (P = .03), problem-solving coping (P = .03), and life
      satisfaction (P = .047), and lower aggression (P = .002) than those in the
      control group at the 3-month follow-up. At post-program, MBSR participants had
      higher cognitive accuracy when faced with negative emotion stimuli (P = .02).
      Also, those in the MBSR study arm were more likely to have or maintain reductions
      in HIV VL at 3-month follow-up than those in the control group (P = .04). In our
      sample, MBSR instruction proved beneficial for important psychological and
      HIV-disease outcomes, even when compared with an active control condition. Lower
      HIV VL levels suggest improved HIV disease control, possibly due to higher levels
      of HIV medication adherence, which is of great significance in both HIV treatment
      and prevention. Additional research is needed to explore further the role of MBSR
      for improving the psychological and physical health of HIV-positive youth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent
      major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and
      remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on
      latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity
      for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of
      interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive
      interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological
      therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy,
      second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or
      lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes
      among adults with a history of SAD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE
      (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases
      was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register
      (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane
      Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial
      registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and
      handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review
      articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: To examine efficacy, we included randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were
      free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we
      intended to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that
      compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of
      psychological therapy, light therapy, second-generation antidepressants,
      melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare
      psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions
      listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as
      monotherapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened abstracts
      and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently
      extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence. MAIN
      RESULTS: We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of
      reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records
      during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full-text review
      for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We
      rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of
      blinding.The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of
      SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45- to 60-minute
      sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment
      but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred.
      Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode
      measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR,
      range 0-90) from September 2011 to mid-April 2012. The incidence of a new
      depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT
      group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS-SR ≥ 20), compared to 74%
      of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI)
      0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence).For participants with
      depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups.
      Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS-SR,
      and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20,
      95% CI -3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality-evidence).The overall
      discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group
      and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low
      quality-evidence).Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high
      risk of bias of the included study and imprecision.Investigators provided no
      information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared
      psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as
      second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the
      onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is
      inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on
      one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small
      sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT
      as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence
      for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or
      against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should
      be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that
      are supported by evidence.

TI  - Mindfulness-based eating awareness training versus itself plus implementation
      intention model: a randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity causes many physical and mental illnesses. This study
      compares mindfulness-based eating awareness training (MB-EAT) versus MB-EAT plus
      implementation intention model for effectiveness on body mass index (BMI), weight
      self-efficacy, and physical activity in obese women with BMIs ≤ 25 (n = 52).
      METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, the participants were selected by the
      simple random sampling method and randomly divided into three groups. A
      12-session MB-EAT of 150 min per session was performed for experimental group I.
      The experimental group II received MB-EAT alone for physical activity planning
      and MB-EAT plus implementation intention; also, both groups were compared to the
      control group. Data were measured by the scales, a questionnaire, and a
      checklist, and the P-values are based on the results of the generalized
      estimating equation (GEE) test. P < 0.001 were considered the significance level.
      RESULTS: The MB-EAT and MB-EAT + implementation intention effectiveness on the
      two experimental groups' BMI, weight self-efficacy, and physical activity was
      significantly different from the control group. In the integrated group versus
      the MB-EAT group, BMI, physical activity, and physical discomfort, were more
      effective than the weight self-efficacy subscales. Both intervention groups were
      effective on BMI, weight self-efficacy, and physical activity, but the integrated
      group's effectiveness was more. CONCLUSIONS: The MB-EAT effectiveness trial is
      theory-based, reducing weight and the psychological and behavioral consequences
      of overweight and obese adults. The MB-EAT + the Implementation intention model
      is to plan regular and daily exercise according to each individual's specific
      circumstances. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial registration number:
      (IRCT20200919048767N1).

LID - 3559
AB  - Lifestyle interventions can have a positive impact on quality of life and
      psychological parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). In this
      randomized controlled trial, 145 participants with MetS (62.8% women; 59.7 ± 9.3
      years) were randomized to (1) 5-day fasting followed by 10 weeks of lifestyle
      modification (F + LM; modified DASH diet, exercise, mindfulness; n = 73) or (2)
      10 weeks of lifestyle modification only (LM; n = 72). Outcomes were assessed at
      weeks 0, 1, 12, and 24, and included quality of life (Short-Form 36 Health Survey
      Questionnaire, SF-36), anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,
      HADS), stress (Cohen Perceived Stress Scale, CPSS), mood (Profile of Mood States,
      POMS), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale, GSE), mindfulness (Mindfulness
      Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS), and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale,
      SCS). At week 1, POMS depression and fatigue scores were significantly lower in F
      + LM compared to LM. At week 12, most self-report outcomes improved in both
      groups-only POMS vigor was significantly higher in F + LM than in LM. Most of the
      beneficial effects within the groups persisted at week 24. Fasting can induce
      mood-modulating effects in the short term. LM induced several positive effects on
      quality of life and psychological parameters in patients with MetS.

TI  - Predictors and Effects of Usage of an Online Mindfulness Intervention for
      Distressed Cancer Patients: Usability Study.
PG  - e17526
LID - 10.2196/17526 [doi]
LID - e17526
AB  - BACKGROUND: One in three cancer patients experience high psychological distress.
      Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing psychological distress
      in this patient group. However, these interventions lack availability and
      flexibility, which may compromise participation in the intervention for cancer
      patients experiencing late symptoms like fatigue or pain. Therefore,
      mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly offered via the internet.
      However, little is known about the usage of these online mindfulness-based
      interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to (1) predict uptake of and
      adherence to online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) using baseline
      patient characteristics (demographic, cancer-related, personality, and
      psychological variables) and (2) examine the relations between adherence and
      treatment outcomes in eMBCT for cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 125 cancer
      patients were assigned to eMBCT in a parent randomized controlled trial comparing
      MBCT and eMBCT with treatment as usual in distressed cancer patients. Various
      usage measures of eMBCT were automatically tracked within the online program.
      Based on activity of use, participants were classified as nonusers, minimal
      users, low users, and intended users. Questionnaires were used to assess baseline
      characteristics (preintervention) and outcomes (pre- and postintervention). To
      answer the research questions, data were analyzed with t tests, χ(2) tests, and
      linear regression models. RESULTS: Based on weekly activity, participants were
      classified as nonusers (n=17, 13.6%), who completed no exercises in MBCT; minimal
      users (n=31, 24.8%), who completed at least one exercise of one to three
      sessions; low users (n=12, 9.6%), who completed at least one exercise of four to
      seven sessions; and intended users (n=65, 52.0%), who completed at least one
      exercise of eight to nine sessions. Nonusers had more fear of cancer recurrence
      at baseline than users (uptake), and intended users were more conscientious than
      minimal and low users (adherence). Intended users reported a larger reduction in
      psychological distress and more improvement of positive mental health (ie,
      emotional, psychological, and social well-being) after the intervention than
      other participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that adherence was related to
      improved patient outcomes. Patients with strong fear of recurrence or low levels
      of conscientiousness should receive extra attention, as they are less likely to
      respectively start or complete eMBCT. Future research may focus on the
      development of flexible and adaptive eMBCT programs to fit individual needs.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for HIV treatment side effects: a randomized,
      wait-list controlled trial.
PG  - 161-71
LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.04.007 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV offer life-extending
      benefit; however, the side effects associated with ART use negatively impact
      quality of life and medication adherence among people living with HIV.
      OBJECTIVES: This study tested the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
      (MBSR) for reducing ART symptoms and bother/distress related to ART side effects.
      Secondary aims were to test the impact of MBSR on medication adherence and
      psychological functioning. METHODS: Seventy-six people living with HIV who were
      actively taking ART and reported distress from ART-related side effects were
      randomly assigned to an MBSR program or a wait-list control (WLC) standard care
      condition. We measured side effects, ART adherence, perceived stress, depression,
      positive and negative affect, and mindfulness at three time points: baseline,
      three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up. Side effects and related distress
      were assessed separately from other symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with a WLC,
      participants in the MBSR condition experienced a reduction in the frequency of
      symptoms attributable to ARTs at three months post-intervention (mean
      difference=0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.01, 0.66; t(132)=2.04, P=0.044)
      and six months post-intervention (mean difference=0.38; 95% CI=0.05, 0.71;
      t(132)=2.27, P=0.025). MBSR participants also experienced a reduction in distress
      associated with those symptoms at three months post-intervention (mean
      difference=0.47; 95% CI=0.003, 0.94; t(132)=1.99, P=0.048) compared with the WLC
      condition. CONCLUSION: MBSR is a promising approach for reducing HIV
      treatment-related side effects.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to treat multiple chemical sensitivities: a
      randomized pilot trial.
PG  - 233-8

AB  - Multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) is a medically unexplained and socially
      disabling disorder characterized by negative health effects attributed to
      exposure to common airborne chemicals. Currently, there is no evidence-based
      treatment. The objectives of the study were to assess the feasibility of an
      8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program (MBCT) for adults with MCS and
      to evaluate possible effects on psychological distress and illness perception.
      The study design was a randomized clinical trial. The MBCT programme comprised 8
      weekly sessions of 2½ hours. Forty-two adults were screened for eligibility and
      37 were included. Mean age of the participants was 51.6 years, 35 (94.6%) were
      female and 21 (56.8%) were unemployed. Measures of psychological distress and
      illness perceptions were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and at 3 months
      follow-up. No significant differences in effect measures were found between the
      groups. However, those who completed the MBCT program generally reported
      benefiting in terms of improved coping strategies and sleep quality. The positive
      verbal feedback from the participants in the MBCT group suggests that a larger
      randomized clinical trial on the effect of MBCT for MCS could be considered.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Caregivers of Frail Older Chinese Adults: A
      Study Protocol.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19095447 [doi]
LID - 5447
AB  - Studies have consistently showed that informal caregivers have worse health, more
      medical consultations, anxiety and depression, and lower quality of life than
      those who do not provide such care. Positive outcomes of psychoeducation
      interventions have been found, but many of them are relatively long in duration,
      making them less cost-effective in implementation. The proposed study is a
      multi-site, three-arm randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness-based
      intervention for Chinese family caregivers. Effects of the intervention will be
      compared with those of an evidence-based psychoeducation program and
      treatment-as-usual. Two hundred forty cross-generational caregivers of frail
      older adults with moderate to severe levels of frailty will be recruited and
      randomly assigned to mindfulness-based intervention, psychoeducation, and
      treatment-as-usual experimental conditions. Program effectiveness will be
      analyzed on measures of caregiver burden, depression, anxiety, positive
      caregiving experience, spirituality, family conflict, and the biomarker of heart
      rate variability. Measures on coping styles, experiential avoidance, and
      self-efficacy will be explored to see if they mediate the changes to participant
      improvements in outcomes. Six-month follow-up will be included to investigate the
      maintenance effects. This study will provide evidence on mindfulness-based
      interventions on caregivers of frail older adults and expand the existing models
      of intergenerational caregiving in Chinese culture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to estimate the effect of mindfulness therapy on mental
      health. METHODS: Two researchers searched 12 databases to identify relevant
      trials that were published from 1 January 2018 to 1 May 2023. We performed a
      meta-analysis to determine the effect of mindfulness therapy on depression, which
      was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS),
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and
      Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS); anxiety, which was measured by the Beck
      Anxiety Inventory (BAI), PROMIS, and DASS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
      (GAD-7); stress, which was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), DASS,
      and GAD-7; mindfulness, which was measured by the GAD-7, Five Facet Mindfulness
      Questionnaire (FFMQ), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Short Form-12
      Mental Component Score (SF-12 MCS) and Short Form-12 Physical Component Score
      (SF-12 PCS); and sleep quality, which was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI). After screening studies based on the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,824
      participants were ultimately included. RESULTS: All these studies demonstrated
      positive effects of mindfulness therapy on depression (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI:
      [-0.44, -0.22], p < 0.00001, I2 = 29%), anxiety (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI: [-0.46,
      -0.25], p < 0.00001, I2 = 40%), stress (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: [-0.48, -0.29], p <
      0.00001, I2 = 69%) and sleep quality scores (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI: [-1.54, -0.09],
      p = 0.03, I2 = 0%). However, there was no significant difference in mindfulness
      (SMD = -0.12, 95% CI: [-0.36, -0.12], p = 0.34, I2 = 34%) between the mindfulness
      therapy group and the control group. DISCUSSION: In future studies, it is
      necessary to consider the investigation on whether the strategies of improving
      the mindfulness therapy in adherence and fidelity can work on the improvement of
      the outcomes in mental health. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

AB  - BACKGROUND: People frequently experience physical and psychological challenges
      (e.g., depression and anxiety) and high risk of poor prognosis after an acute
      coronary event. Mindfulness-based intervention holds promise as an effective
      approach to promoting health and well-being. OBJECTIVES: To explore the
      feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects on psychological distress,
      cardiovascular risk factors and health-related quality of life of a
      mindfulness-oriented psycho-behavioral intervention for patients with acute
      coronary syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to
      test the feasibility, acceptability and potential effects of the intervention in
      50 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The intervention included six weekly
      sessions, including one face-to-face session and five WeChat-delivered sessions
      that incorporated mindfulness training with health education and lifestyle
      modification. Eligible patients were recruited in two public hospitals in China
      and randomly allocated into the intervention group (n = 25) or control group
      (n = 25). RESULTS: Intervention feasibility was supported by a relatively high
      recruitment rate (66.7%) and retention rate (84%) and a smooth and brief data
      collection procedure (15 to 25 min) of the pilot study. Positive responses of the
      acceptability dichotomous scale ranged from 81% to 100%, suggesting the
      intervention was generally acceptable. The intervention had a significant
      group × time effect on dietary behavior (B = 0.31,95% CI: 0.08, 0.54, P = 0.008)
      with an effect size (Cohen's d) of -0.72. CONCLUSIONS: The mindfulness-oriented
      psycho-behavioral intervention appears to be feasible and acceptable and have a
      promising effect on dietary behavior in patients with acute coronary syndrome. A
      fully powered randomized controlled trial is warranted to further assess the
      efficacy of the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial

AB  - A pilot-randomised controlled trial (RCT) examined the effects of a brief
      mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on persistent pain patients and assessed the
      feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT. A brief (15 min) mindfulness
      body-scan audio was compared with an active control administered in a clinic and
      then used independently over 1 month. Immediate effects of the intervention were
      assessed with brief measures of pain severity, distraction and distress.
      Assessments at baseline, 1 week and 1 month included pain severity and
      interference, mood, pain-catastrophizing, mindfulness, self-efficacy, quality of
      life and intervention acceptability. Of 220 referred patients, 147 were
      randomised and 71 completed all assessments. There were no significant immediate
      intervention effects. There were significant positive effects for ratings of
      intervention 'usefulness' at 1 week (p = 0.044), and pain self-efficacy at 1
      month (p = 0.039) for the MBI group compared with control. Evidently, it is
      feasible to recruit persistent pain patients to a brief MBI study. Strategies are
      needed to maximise retention of participants.Trial registration Current

TI  - Rationale and design of a multisite randomized clinical trial examining an
      integrated behavioral treatment for veterans with co-occurring chronic pain and
      opioid use disorder: The pain and opioids integrated treatment in veterans
      (POSITIVE) trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) individually represent a
      risk to health and well-being. Concerningly, there is evidence that they are
      frequently co-morbid. While few treatments exist that simultaneously target both
      conditions, preliminary work has supported the feasibility of an integrated
      behavioral treatment targeting pain interference and opioid misuse. This
      treatment combined Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Mindfulness-Based
      Relapse Prevention (ACT+MBRP). This paper describes the protocol for the
      adequately powered efficacy study of this integrated treatment. METHODS: A
      multisite randomized controlled trial will examine the efficacy of ACT+MBRP in
      comparison to a parallel education control condition, focusing on opioid safety
      and pain education. Participants include veterans (n = 160; 21-75 years old)
      recruited from three Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare Systems with chronic
      pain who are on a stable dose of buprenorphine. Both conditions include twelve
      weekly 90 min group sessions delivered via telehealth. Primary outcomes include
      pain interference (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System - Pain
      Interference) and hazardous opioid use (Current Opioid Misuse Measure), which
      will be examined at the end of the active treatment phase and through 12 months
      post-intervention. Secondary analyses will evaluate outcomes including pain
      intensity, depression, pain-related fear, and substance use, as well as treatment
      mechanisms. CONCLUSION: This study will determine the efficacy of an integrated
      behavioral treatment program for pain interference and hazardous opioid use among
      veterans with chronic pain and OUD who are prescribed buprenorphine, addressing a
      critical need for more integrated treatments for chronic pain and OUD. TRIAL

      Chinese older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a multicenter randomized

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and
      therefore early intervention could have the best chance of preserving brain
      health. There are significant differences in health awareness, living customs,
      and daily behaviors among Chinese older adults compared to Europeans and
      Americans. Because the synergistic benefits of multidomain non-pharmacological
      interventions are consistent with the multifactorial pathogenicity of MCI, such
      interventions are more appealing, easier to adhere to, and more relevant to daily
      life than single-mode interventions. One of the aims of this study is to verify
      the effect of multidomain intervention strategies for MCI patients based on
      Chinese population characteristics, and the other is to establish a biobank and
      image database to investigate the pathogenesis and pathways of cognitive
      impairment. METHODS: Our study was designed as a national multicenter,
      community-based randomized controlled trial (RCT). Twelve medical institutions in
      ten Chinese cities will participate in our study from 2020 to 2024, and 1080
      community residents aged 50 and above will be enrolled as participants. Each
      sub-center will be responsible for 90 participants (30 people per community)
      across three communities (non-contact control group, health education group, and
      multidomain intervention group). The community will be the basic unit of the
      present study, and all participants in each community will receive the same
      intervention/control measure. Three working groups are set up in each sub-center
      to manage the three communities independently to minimize interference at the
      implementation level between the groups. The multidomain intervention group will
      receive integrated interventions including exercise, nutrition, sleep, health
      education and mindfulness meditation. All data generated by the research will be
      analyzed and processed by statistical software (such as SPSS 21.0, Python 3.0,
      etc.), and part of the research data will be displayed in the form of graphs and
      tables. DISCUSSION: In order to achieve a high-quality community intervention
      study, it is crucial to have a well-designed experimental protocol that follows
      rigorous scientific methodology. In addition, effective management of quality
      control measures and monitoring compliance throughout the study process are
      essential components. This study provides a detailed discussion of stakeholder
      compliance, research quality control, potential harm and mitigation, auditing,
      and future plans in order to better address research issues. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Mindfulness meditation for younger breast cancer survivors: a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1231-40
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk for
      psychological and behavioral disturbances after cancer treatment. Targeted
      interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group. METHODS:
      This randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief, mindfulness-based
      intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress,
      depression, and inflammatory activity. Women diagnosed with early stage breast
      cancer at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly
      assigned to a 6-week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPS) intervention group (n =
      39) or to a wait-list control group (n = 32). Participants completed
      questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive
      symptoms (primary outcomes) as well as physical symptoms, cancer-related
      distress, and positive outcomes. Blood samples were collected to examine genomic
      and circulating markers of inflammation. Participants also completed
      questionnaires at a 3-month follow-up assessment. RESULTS: In linear mixed
      models, the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress
      (P = .004) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms (P = .094), as well as
      significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression (P = .009) and
      inflammatory signaling (P = .001) at postintervention. Improvements in secondary
      outcomes included reduced fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and
      increased peace and meaning and positive affect (P < .05 for all). Intervention
      effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the
      3-month follow-up assessment, although reductions in cancer-related distress were
      observed at that assessment. CONCLUSIONS: A brief, mindfulness-based intervention
      demonstrated preliminary short-term efficacy in reducing stress, behavioral
      symptoms, and proinflammatory signaling in younger breast cancer survivors.

TI  - Internet-based instructor-led mindfulness for work-related rumination, fatigue,
      and sleep: Assessing facets of mindfulness as mechanisms of change. A randomized
      waitlist control trial.
PG  - 153-169
LID - 10.1037/ocp0000028 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to extend our theoretical understanding of how mindfulness-based
      interventions exert their positive influence on measures of occupational health.
      Employing a randomized waitlist control study design, we sought to (a) assess an
      Internet-based instructor-led mindfulness intervention for its effect on key
      factors associated with "recovery from work," specifically, work-related
      rumination, fatigue, and sleep quality; (b) assess different facets of
      mindfulness (acting with awareness, describing, nonjudging, and nonreacting) as
      mechanisms of change; and (c) assess whether the effect of the intervention was
      maintained over time by following up our participants after 3 and 6 months.
      Participants who completed the mindfulness intervention (n = 60) reported
      significantly lower levels of work-related rumination and fatigue, and
      significantly higher levels of sleep quality, when compared with waitlist control
      participants (n = 58). Effects of the intervention were maintained at 3- and
      6-month follow-up with medium to large effect sizes. The effect of the
      intervention was primarily explained by increased levels of only 1 facet of
      mindfulness (acting with awareness). This study provides support for online
      mindfulness interventions to aid recovery from work and furthers our
      understanding with regard to how mindfulness interventions exert their positive
      effects. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Exploring the clinical outcome of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for bipolar
      and unipolar depressive patients in routine clinical practice: a pilot study.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s40345-019-0153-0 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been adopted as an
      evidence-based treatment for unipolar depressive disorder (UDD). Although MBCT
      has not been included in the treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder (BD), MBCT
      is regularly being offered to patients with BD in routine clinical practice. In
      this pilot study we used routine outcome monitoring (ROM) data to explore whether
      there are indications that patients with BD might benefit less from MBCT than
      patients with UDD in terms of feasibility and effectiveness. METHODS: The study
      population consisted of patients with BD (n = 30) or UDD (n = 501) who received
      MBCT at the Radboudumc Centre for Mindfulness in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.
      Patients completed self-report measures of depressive symptom severity, worry,
      well-being, mindfulness skills and self-compassion pre- and post MBCT as part of
      the ROM. RESULTS: There were significant less patients with BD who decided to
      start MBCT after intake than patients with UDD. No differences in dropout between
      groups were found. Results showed significant moderate to large improvements in
      both groups after MBCT, while no differences between groups were found, on all
      outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there are no
      indications that MBCT, when delivered in heterogeneous patient groups in routine
      clinical practice, is less beneficial for patients with BD than patients with UDD
      in terms of feasibility and effectiveness. This lends support to conduct an
      adequately powered RCT to examine the (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT in BD as the
      next step before implementing MBCT on a larger scale in patients with BD.

      needs.
PG  - 1476-87
LID - 10.1037/a0027537 [doi]
AB  - Parents and teachers of children with special needs face unique social-emotional
      challenges in carrying out their caregiving roles. Stress associated with these
      roles impacts parents' and special educators' health and well-being, as well as
      the quality of their parenting and teaching. No rigorous studies have assessed
      whether mindfulness training (MT) might be an effective strategy to reduce stress
      and cultivate well-being and positive caregiving in these adults. This randomized
      controlled study assessed the efficacy of a 5-week MT program for parents and
      educators of children with special needs. Participants receiving MT showed
      significant reductions in stress and anxiety and increased mindfulness,
      self-compassion, and personal growth at program completion and at 2 months
      follow-up in contrast to waiting-list controls. Relational competence also showed
      significant positive changes, with medium-to-large effect sizes noted on measures
      of empathic concern and forgiveness. MT significantly influenced caregiving
      competence specific to teaching. Mindfulness changes at program completion
      mediated outcomes at follow-up, suggesting its importance in maintaining
      emotional balance and facilitating well-being in parents and teachers of children
      with developmental challenges.

TI  - Dispositional Mindfulness, Meditation, and Conditional Goal Setting.
PG  - 204-214
AB  - Conditional goal setting (CGS, the tendency to regard high order goals such as
      happiness, as conditional upon the achievement of lower order goals) is observed
      in individuals with depression and recent research has suggested a link between
      levels of dispositional mindfulness and conditional goal setting in depressed
      patients. Since interventions which aim to increase mindfulness through training
      in meditation are used with patients suffering from depression it is of interest
      to examine whether such interventions might alter CGS. Study 1 examined the
      correlation between changes in dispositional mindfulness and changes in CGS over
      a 3-4 month period in patients participating in a pilot randomised controlled
      trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Results indicated that
      increases in dispositional mindfulness were significantly associated with
      decreases in CGS, although this effect could not be attributed specifically to
      the group who had received training in meditation. Study 2 explored the impact of
      brief periods of either breathing or loving kindness meditation on CGS in 55
      healthy participants. Contrary to expectation, a brief period of meditation
      increased CGS. Further analyses indicated that this effect was restricted to
      participants low in goal re-engagement ability who were allocated to loving
      kindness meditation. Longer term changes in dispositional mindfulness are
      associated with reductions in CGS in patients with depressed mood. However
      initial reactions to meditation, and in particular loving kindness meditation,
      may be counterintuitive and further research is required in order to determine
      the relationship between initial reactions and longer-term benefits of meditation
      practice.

TI  - Cognitive rehabilitation and mindfulness reduce cognitive complaints in multiple
      sclerosis (REMIND-MS): A randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive problems, both complaints and objective impairments, are
      frequent and disabling in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and profoundly
      affect daily living. However, intervention studies that focus on cognitive
      problems that patients experience in their daily lives are limited. This study
      therefore aimed to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation
      therapy (CRT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on patient-reported
      cognitive complaints in MS. METHODS: In this randomized-controlled trial, MS
      patients with cognitive complaints completed questionnaires and underwent
      neuropsychological assessments at baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
      Patient-reported cognitive complaints were primarily investigated. Secondary
      outcomes included personalized cognitive goals and objective cognitive function.
      CRT and MBCT were compared to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) using linear
      mixed models. RESULTS: Patients were randomized into CRT (n = 37), MBCT (n = 36)
      or ETAU (n = 37), of whom 100 completed the study. Both CRT and MBCT positively
      affected patient-reported cognitive complaints compared to ETAU at post-treatment
      (p<.05), but not 6 months later. At 6-month follow-up, CRT had a positive effect
      on personalized cognitive goals (p=.028) and MBCT on processing speed (p=.027).
      Patients with less cognitive complaints at baseline benefited more from CRT on
      the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (i.e. primary outcome measuring cognitive
      complaints) at post-treatment (p=.012-.040), and those with better processing
      speed at baseline benefited more from MBCT (p=.016). CONCLUSION: Both CRT and
      MBCT alleviated cognitive complaints in MS patients immediately after treatment
      completion, but these benefits did not persist. In the long term, CRT showed
      benefits on personalized cognitive goals and MBCT on processing speed. These
      results thereby provide insight in the specific contributions of available
      cognitive treatments for MS patients.

TI  - Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in reducing psychological
      distress and improving sleep in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: study
      protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (MindIBD).
PG  - 183
LID - 10.1186/s40359-023-01127-0 [doi]
LID - 183
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) suffer from
      psychological distress, fatigue and sleep disturbances, which are associated with
      reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased societal costs. Only limited
      psychosocial treatment options are available. As Mindfulness-Based Cognitive
      Therapy (MBCT) has demonstrated to improve psychological distress, QoL and sleep
      in other populations, MBCT might also be effective in patients with IBD. METHODS:
      The MindIBD study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial
      comparing MBCT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) versus TAU alone in a targeted
      number of 136 IBD patients in remission, aged 16 years and older with at least
      mild psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total
      score ≥ 11). Primary outcome is reduction of psychological distress
      post-intervention, measured by the HADS. In addition, the effect of MBCT on sleep
      quality (including actigraphy and electroencephalography recordings), fatigue,
      disease activity, perceived disease control, QoL and positive mental health will
      be examined. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months follow-up. Cost-effectiveness will be determined and a process evaluation
      will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable insight into the
      clinical effect of MBCT on psychological distress, sleep quality, fatigue and QoL
      in IBD patients and into the cost-effectiveness. If effective, MBCT can be a
      valuable addition to the available psychosocial interventions for patients with
      IBD. Moreover, findings from this study may also be applicable in patients with
      other chronic conditions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04646785,

AB  - It is well-documented that university students have an increased risk in
      developing psychological problems because they face multiple stressors.
      Cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness-based stress prevention programs were
      shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress in
      university students. However, little is known of their effect on resource
      activation. Additionally, most validated interventions are unidimensional, i.e.,
      including one stress-coping approach. In this study, we investigated the
      short-term effects of a multidimensional stress prevention program on students'
      quality of life, psychological symptoms and resources, and resilience factors
      against stress. Using an experimental design, 64 healthy undergraduate students
      (56 women), between 18 and 34 years old (M = 21.34, SD = 2.53), from the
      University of Fribourg, Switzerland, were randomly allocated either to the
      intervention or the wait-list control group. The intervention group participated
      in a multidimensional stress prevention program, integrating mindfulness-based
      activities, cognitive and behavioral strategies, social skills, and emotional
      regulation exercises. The program consisted of eight 2-h weekly sessions. Before
      and after the intervention, participants completed self-reported questionnaires
      evaluating quality of life; psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety,
      social anxiety, and interpersonal problems; as well as psychological resources
      like self-efficacy, sense of coherence, self-compassion, and social support,
      presented online. A standardized clinical interview was performed at pre- and
      post-measurement times. To analyze the sort-term effects of the program, we used
      mixed, two-factorial ANOVAs (per-protocol analyses). In accordance with our
      hypotheses, our results showed significant reduction of psychological symptoms,
      including anxiety, interpersonal problems, and symptoms of pain; a significant
      increase in quality of life, sense of coherence, and self-compassion in students
      who participated in the intervention program compared to the control group, (all
      p < 0.05). No significant results were found for symptoms of depression, social
      anxiety, self-efficacy, and social support. These preliminary findings indicate
      specific short-term effects of our multidimensional stress prevention program on
      psychological symptoms and on quality of life as well as promising effects on
      psychological resources and factors associated with resilience against stress.
      Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of the intervention as
      well as the effects in clinical samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve
      aspects of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in
      person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps
      as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few
      studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can
      enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public. METHODS: The present
      pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the
      self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app 'Headspace' (n = 38) for a period of
      10 or 30 days, to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults
      from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress
      Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and
      after 10 and 30 days of the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants (MM n = 9,
      WL n = 3) were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control,
      the MM app positively impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and
      resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen's d =
      0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day
      assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM
      app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self-reported benefits.
      Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in
      perceived stress that emerged in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot
      randomised controlled trial shows that self-reported improvements in psychosocial
      outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short-term engagement with a
      mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive
      studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN34618894.

TI  - Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Training in Surgery: Additional Analysis
      of the Mindful Surgeon Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to be feasible in
      surgical trainees, but affective, cognitive, and performance benefits seen in
      other high-stress populations have yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To explore
      potential benefits to stress, cognition, and performance in postgraduate year 1
      (PGY-1) surgery residents receiving modified mindfulness-based stress reduction
      (modMBSR). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This follow-up study is an analysis
      of the Mindful Surgeon pilot randomized clinical trial of modMBSR (n = 12) vs an
      active control (n = 9), evaluated at baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 1
      year (T3), took place at an academic medical center residency training program
      among PGY-1 surgery residents. Data were collected between June 2016 and June
      2017 and analyzed from June 2017 to December 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Weekly 2-hour
      modMBSR classes and 20 minutes of daily home practice during an 8-week period vs
      an active control (different content, same structure). MAIN OUTCOMES AND
      MEASURES: Preliminary evidence of efficacy was explored, primarily focusing on
      perceived stress and executive function and secondarily on burnout, depression,
      motor skill performance, and changes in blood oxygen level-dependent functional
      neuroimaging during an emotion regulation task. Group mean scores were calculated
      at T1, T2, and T3 and in linear mixed-effects multivariate analysis. Effect size
      for analysis of covariance is presented as partial η2 with the following cutoff
      points: small, less than 0.06; medium, 0.06 to 0.14; large, greater than 0.14.
      RESULTS: Postgraduate year 1 surgery residents (N = 21; 8 [38%] women) were
      randomized to a modMBSR arm (n = 12) or an active control arm (n = 9). Linear
      mixed-effects modeling revealed differences at T2 and T3 in perceived stress
      (mean [SD] difference at T2: modMBSR, 1.42 [5.74]; control, 3.44 [6.71];
      η2 = 0.07; mean [SD] difference at T3: modMBSR, 1.00 [4.18]; control, 1.33
      [4.69]; η2 = 0.09) and in mindfulness (mean [SD] difference at T2: modMBSR, 3.08
      [3.63]; control, 1.56 [4.28]; η2 = 0.13; mean [SD] difference at T3: modMBSR,
      2.17 [3.66]; control, -0.11 [6.19]; η2 = 0.15). Burnout at T2 (mean [SD]
      difference: modMBSR, 4.50 [9.08]; control, 3.44 [6.71]; η2 = 0.01) and T3 (mean
      [SD] difference: modMBSR, 5.50 [9.96]; control, 5.56 [9.69]; η2 = 0.01) showed
      similar increase in both groups. Working memory increased more at T2 in the
      modMBSR arm (mean [SD] difference, 0.35 [0.60]) than in the control arm (mean
      [SD] difference, 0.21 [0.74]; η2 = 0.02) and at T3 (modMBSR, 0.68 [0.69];
      control, 0.26 [0.58]; η2 = 0.20). Cognitive control decreased more in the control
      arm at T2 (mean [SD] difference at T2: modMBSR, 0.15 [0.40]; control, -0.07
      [0.32]; η2 = 0.13) and at T3 (mean [SD] difference: modMBSR, 0.07 [0.59];
      control, -0.26 [0.53]; η2 = 0.16). Mean (SD) circle-cutting time improved more at
      T2 in the modMBSR arm (-24.08 [63.00] seconds) than in the control arm (-4.22
      [112.94] seconds; η2 = 0.23) and at T3 in the modMBSR arm (-4.83 [77.94] seconds)
      than in the control arm (11.67 [145.17] seconds; η2 = 0.13). Blood oxygen
      level-dependent functional neuroimaging during an emotional regulation task
      showed unique postintervention activity in the modMBSR arm in areas associated
      with executive function control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and
      self-awareness (precuneus). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this pilot randomized
      clinical trial, modMBSR in PGY-1 surgery residents showed potential benefits to
      well-being and executive function, suggesting a powerful role for
      mindfulness-based cognitive training to support resident well-being and
      performance, as mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
      Education. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03141190.

      and Moderation Effects of Spirituality.
PG  - 532-542
LID - 10.1089/jicm.2023.0179 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Understanding the relevance of religion or spirituality (R/S) in the
      treatment of mental disorders is central to clinical and academic psychiatry. In
      this secondary analysis, associations of R/S with depression were investigated
      with respect to a new second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, the
      Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program. Methods: Different
      aspects of spirituality, spiritual coping, and spiritual engagement were assessed
      in 81 patients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate depression. Treatment effects
      on R/S postscores and predictor and moderation effects of depression severity and
      stress change-scores were evaluated at 8 weeks (MBLM vs. CONTROL [drug
      continuation therapy] vs. TAU [inpatient treatment as usual]) and 6 months
      (TAU+MBLM vs. TAU). Results: At both time points, significant differences between
      MBLM versus TAU and CONTROL were found in a range of spiritual outcomes, most of
      them with a medium-to-large effect size and in favor of MBLM. Baseline interest
      in spirituality (p = 0.001) and baseline spiritual mind-body practice (p = 0.017)
      were identified as independent predictors of change in depression severity at 6
      months. Moreover, moderation analyses found that patients reporting often/regular
      spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months did not benefit differently from
      TAU+MBLM versus TAU (p = 0.437) regarding their change in depression severity and
      stress, while those reporting no/seldom spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months
      benefited significantly worse from TAU than from TAU+MBLM (p = 0.002).
      Conclusions: Participation in the MBLM program resulted in significantly greater
      increases in spirituality in depressed patients than standard therapy. Interest
      in spirituality and engagement in spiritual mind-body practices at baseline were
      positive predictors of clinical outcome in both groups. Patients of any group who
      regularly performed spiritual mind-body practices benefited equally in terms of
      antidepressant outcomes, underlining the benefit of these practices within a
      general therapeutic framework. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03652220.

LID - e017858
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To synthesise the available evidence on interventions designed to
      improve individual resilience. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis
      METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid Medline, Ovid
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Ovid Cochrane and WHO Clinical Trials Registry in order to
      identify any controlled trials or randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining
      the efficacy of interventions aimed at improving psychological resilience. Pooled
      effects sizes were calculated using the random-effects model of meta-analysis.
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Valid and reliable measures of psychological resilience.
      RESULTS: Overall, 437 citations were retrieved and 111 peer-reviewed articles
      were examined in full. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria and were
      subject to a quality assessment, with 11 RCTs being included in the final
      meta-analysis. Programmes were stratified into one of three categories (1)
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions, (2) mindfulness-based
      interventions or (3) mixed Interventions, those combining CBT and Mindfulness
      training. A meta-analysis found a moderate positive effect of resilience
      interventions (0.44 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.64) with subgroup analysis suggesting
      CBT-based, mindfulness and mixed interventions were effective. CONCLUSIONS:
      Resilience interventions based on a combination of CBT and mindfulness techniques
      appear to have a positive impact on individual resilience.

TI  - Understanding and restoring dopaminergic function in fibromyalgia patients using
      a mindfulness-based psychological intervention: a [18F]-DOPA PET study. Study
      protocol for the FIBRODOPA study-a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 864

LID - 864
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a very prevalent and debilitating chronic pain
      disorder that is difficult to treat. Mindfulness-based techniques are regarded as
      a very promising approach for the treatment of chronic pain and in particular FM.
      The Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention, a
      mindfulness-based group intervention, has shown beneficial effects in
      opioid-treated chronic pain patients, including reduced pain severity, functional
      interference, and opioid dosing, by restoring neurophysiological and behavioral
      responses to reward. The first evidence for a hypodopaminergic state and impaired
      reward processing in FM has been reported. However, little is known about its
      impact on dopamine (DA) function and in particular with regard to DA responses to
      monetary reward in FM. The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate if
      MORE is able to restore the DA function in FM patients, in particular with regard
      to the DA responses to reward, and to reduce pain and mood complaints in FM.
      METHODS: The present study is a multi-center interventional RCT with 3 time
      points: before the intervention, after completion of the intervention, and
      3 months after completion of the intervention. Sixty-four FM patients will be
      randomly assigned to either the MORE intervention (N = 32) or a non-intervention
      control group (N = 32). Additionally, a comparison group of healthy women (N =
      20) for PET measures will be enrolled and another group of healthy women (N = 15)
      will do the ambulatory assessments only. The MORE intervention consists of eight
      2-h-long group sessions administered weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Before and
      after the intervention, FM participants will undergo [18F] DOPA positron emission
      tomography (PET) and functional MR imaging while performing a reward task. The
      primary outcome will be endogeneous DA changes measured with [18F] DOPA PET at
      baseline, after the intervention (after 8 weeks for the non-intervention control
      group), and at 3 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be (1) clinical pain
      measures and FM symptoms using standardized clinical scales; (2) functional brain
      changes; (3) measures of negative and positive affect, stress, and reward
      experience in daily life using the ambulatory assessment method (AA); and (4)
      biological measures of stress including cortisol and alpha-amylase. DISCUSSION:
      If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of MORE in restoring DA
      function, reducing pain, and improving mood symptoms, MORE can be judged to be a
      promising means to improve the quality of life in FM patients. The findings of
      this trial may inform health care providers about the potential use of the MORE
      intervention as a possible non-pharmacological intervention for FM. TRIAL

TI  - The coMforT study of a trauma-informed mindfulness intervention for women who
      have experienced domestic violence and abuse: a protocol for an intervention
      refinement and individually randomized parallel feasibility trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is common and destructive to
      health. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major mental health
      consequence of DVA. People who have experienced DVA have specific needs, arising
      from the repeated and complex nature of the trauma. The National Institute for
      Health and Care Excellence recommends more research on the effectiveness of
      psychological interventions for people who have experienced DVA. There is growing
      evidence that mindfulness-based interventions may help trauma symptoms. METHODS:
      Intervention refinement and randomized controlled feasibility trial. A prototype
      trauma-informed mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (TI-MBCT) intervention will
      be co-produced following qualitative interviews and consensus exercise with
      stakeholders. Participants in the feasibility trial will be recruited from DVA
      agencies in two geographical regions and randomized to receive either TI-MBCT or
      usual care (self-referral to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
      (IAPT) service). TI-MBCT will be delivered as a group-based eight-week program.
      It will not be possible to blind the participants or the assessors to the study
      allocation. The following factors will inform the feasibility of progressing to a
      fully powered trial: recruitment, retention, intervention fidelity, and the
      acceptability of the intervention and trial design to participants. We will also
      test the feasibility of measuring the following participant outcomes before and 6
      months post-randomization: PTSD, dissociative symptoms, depression, anxiety, DVA
      re-victimization, self-compassion, and mother-reported child health. Process
      evaluation and economic analysis will be embedded within the feasibility trial.
      DISCUSSION: This study will lead to the development of a TI-MBCT intervention for
      DVA survivors with PTSD and inform the feasibility and design of a fully powered
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The full trial will aim to determine the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a TI-MBCT intervention in improving the
      clinically important symptoms of PTSD in DVA survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - The Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in Primary Care: A Meta-Analytic
      Review.
PG  - 573-82
LID - 10.1370/afm.1863 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Positive effects have been reported after mindfulness-based
      interventions (MBIs) in diverse clinical and nonclinical populations. Primary
      care is a key health care setting for addressing common chronic conditions, and
      an effective MBI designed for this setting could benefit countless people
      worldwide. Meta-analyses of MBIs have become popular, but little is known about
      their efficacy in primary care. Our aim was to investigate the application and
      efficacy of MBIs that address primary care patients. METHODS: We performed a
      meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials addressing the effect of
      MBIs in adult patients recruited from primary care settings. The PRISMA
      (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and Cochrane
      guidelines were followed. Effect sizes were calculated with the Hedges g in
      random effects models. RESULTS: The meta-analyses were based on 6 trials having a
      total of 553 patients. The overall effect size of MBI compared with a control
      condition for improving general health was moderate (g = 0.48; P = .002), with
      moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 59; P <.05). We found no indication of publication
      bias in the overall estimates. MBIs were efficacious for improving mental health
      (g = 0.56; P = .007), with a high heterogeneity (I(2) = 78; P <.01), and for
      improving quality of life (g = 0.29; P = .002), with a low heterogeneity (I(2) =
      0; P >.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of randomized controlled trials
      applying MBIs in primary care is still limited, our results suggest that these
      interventions are promising for the mental health and quality of life of primary
      care patients. We discuss innovative approaches for implementing MBIs, such as
      complex intervention and stepped care.

TI  - Insurance-Reimbursable Mindfulness for Safety-Net Primary Care Patients: A Pilot
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1744-1759
LID - 10.1007/s12671-019-01116-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness is effective for reducing anxiety and depression and
      increasing chronic disease self-management. An accessible, insurance-reimbursable
      model for implementation in patient-centered medical homes within US healthcare
      systems has promise for patients with multi-morbid conditions. Clarifying both
      the dose needed to impact anxiety, depression and self-management, and the design
      requirements for accessible primary care implementation, is essential. METHODS:
      We tested feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Mindfulness Training
      for Primary Care (MTPC), an 8-week, referral-based, insurance-reimbursable
      mindfulness program integrated within primary care, compared with a Low-Dose
      Comparator (LDC), consisting of a 60-minute mindfulness introduction plus
      referral to community and digital resources. Outcome measures were assessed at
      baseline and 8 weeks. MTPC is trauma-informed, incorporates mindfulness-oriented
      behavior change skills, and is designed to target anxiety, depression, stress,
      and chronic illness selfmanagement. Participants schedule a PCP visit to
      co-create a self-management action plan during week 6. RESULTS: Primary care
      providers (PCP) referred 344 patients over 14 months. Eighty-one participants
      with DSM-V anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, trauma- and stress-related
      disorders participated in this pilot randomized-controlled comparative
      effectiveness trial [MTPC (n=54); LDC (n=27)]. These data suggest that MTPC was
      more effective than LDC for reducing anxiety (p=0.01), enhancing mindfulness
      (p=0.02) and self-compassion (p=0.001), and for catalyzing selfmanagement
      behavior change through action plan initiation (OR=4.34, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS:
      MTPC was successfully integrated into a health system, was billed to insurance,
      and was acceptable to a diverse primary care population. Replication with a
      larger study and further accessibility adaptations are needed to confirm and
      expand these pilot results.

TI  - Mindfulness Meditation for Primary Headache Pain: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 829-838
LID - 10.4103/0366-6999.228242 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that mindfulness meditation has a
      potential effect in controlling headaches, such as migraine and tension-type
      headache; however, its role remains controversial. This review assessed the
      evidence regarding the effects of mindfulness meditation for primary headache
      pain. METHODS: Only English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials [the Cochrane Library], PsycINFO, Psychology and behavioral
      science collection, PsyArticles, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched from
      their inception to November 2016 with the keywords ("meditation" or "mindfulness"
      or "vipassana" or "dzogchen" or "zen" or "integrative body-mind training" or
      "IBMT" or "mindfulness-based stress reduction" or "MBSR" or "mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy" or "MBCT" and "Headache" or "Head pain" or "Cephalodynia" or
      "Cephalalgia" or "Hemicrania" or "Migraine"). Titles, abstracts, and full-text
      articles were screened against study inclusion criteria: controlled trials of
      structured meditation programs for adult patients with primary headache pain. The
      quality of studies included in the meta-analysis was assessed with the Yates
      Quality Rating Scale. The meta-analysis was conducted with Revman 5.3. RESULTS:
      Ten randomized controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial with a
      combined study population of 315 patients were included in the study. When
      compared to control group data, mindfulness meditation induced significant
      improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference, -0.89; 95%
      confidence interval, -1.63 to -0.15; P = 0.02) and headache frequency (-0.67;
      -1.24 to -0.10; P = 0.02). In a subgroup analysis of different meditation forms,
      mindfulness-based stress reduction displayed a significant positive influence on
      pain intensity (P < 0.000). Moreover, 8-week intervention had a significant
      positive effect (P < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness meditation may reduce pain
      intensity and is a promising treatment option for patients. Clinicians may
      consider mindfulness meditation as a viable complementary and alternative medical
      option for primary headache.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Program Plus Amygdala and Insula Retraining (MAIR) for the
      Treatment of Women with Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9103246 [doi]
LID - 3246
AB  - The lack of highly effective treatments for fibromyalgia (FM) represents a great
      challenge for public health. The objective of this parallel, pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) was two-fold: (1) to analyze the clinical effects of
      mindfulness plus amygdala and insula retraining (MAIR) compared to a structurally
      equivalent active control group of relaxation therapy (RT) in the treatment of
      FM; and (2) to evaluate its impact on immune-inflammatory markers and
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in serum. A total of 41 FM patients were
      randomized into two study arms: MAIR (intervention group) and RT (active control
      group), both as add-ons of treatment as usual. MAIR demonstrated significantly
      greater reductions in functional impairment, anxiety, and depression, as well as
      higher improvements in mindfulness, and self-compassion at post-treatment and
      follow-up, with moderate to large effect sizes. Significant decreases in pain
      catastrophizing and psychological inflexibility and improvements in clinical
      severity and health-related quality of life were found at follow-up, but not at
      post-treatment, showing large effect sizes. The number needed to treat was three
      based on the criteria of ≥50% Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) reduction
      post-treatment. Compared to RT, the MAIR showed significant decreases in BDNF. No
      effect of MAIR was observed in immune-inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., TNF-α, IL-6,
      IL-10, and hs-CRP). In conclusion, these results suggest that MAIR, as an
      adjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU), appears to be effective for the management
      of FM symptoms and for reducing BDNF levels in serum.

AB  - Middle adolescents (15-17 years old) are prone to increased risk taking and
      emotional instability. Emotion dysregulation contributes to a variety of
      psychosocial difficulties in this population. A discipline such as yoga offered
      during school may increase emotion regulation, but research in this area is
      lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a yoga intervention on
      the emotion regulation of high school students as compared to physical education
      (PE). In addition, the potential mediating effects of mindful attention,
      self-compassion, and body awareness on the relationship between yoga and emotion
      regulation were examined. High school students were randomized to participate in
      a 16-week yoga intervention (n = 19) or regular PE (n = 18). Pre-post data
      analyses revealed that emotion regulation increased significantly in the yoga
      group as compared to the PE group (F (1,32) = 7.50, p = .01, and eta(2) = .19).
      No significant relationship was discovered between the changes in emotion
      regulation and the proposed mediating variables. Preliminary results suggest that
      yoga increases emotion regulation capacities of middle adolescents and provides
      benefits beyond that of PE alone.

AB  - Meditation-based mind-body therapies (yoga, tai-chi, qi-gong, mindfulness) have
      been suggested to have a potential therapeutic effect on negative symptoms. We
      conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) examining effectiveness of yoga, tai-chi, qi-gong and mindfulness on
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia, using different databases and trial
      registries. The primary outcome was effect of mind-body therapies on negative
      symptoms and the secondary outcome was effect on positive symptoms. Fifteen RCTs
      were included in the meta-analysis (N = 1081 patients). Overall, we found a
      beneficial effect of mind-body interventions on negative symptoms at endpoint
      compared to treatment-as-usual or non-specific control interventions, but the
      effect was small and moderate to high heterogeneity was present. A subgroup
      analysis for different types of therapy revealed a significant effect of
      mindfulness-based and yoga interventions on negative symptoms, but heterogeneity
      within the yoga subgroup was high. Our results did not show an increase of
      positive symptoms (N = 1051). Our results suggest a potential for
      meditation-based mind-body therapies in the treatment of negative symptoms, in
      particular for mindfulness based approaches and to a lesser extent yoga.
      Limitations in the available comparisons do not allow concluding on a specific
      effect of these interventions. Overall, the currently available evidence remains
      limited and does not yet allow one to recommend mind-body therapies for the
      reduction of negative symptoms. However, the present findings justify further
      research on mind-body therapies for the treatment of negative symptoms.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation training effects on CD4+ T lymphocytes in HIV-1 infected
      adults: a small randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 184-8
LID - 10.1016/j.bbi.2008.07.004 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness meditation training has stress reduction benefits in various patient
      populations, but its effects on biological markers of HIV-1 progression are
      unknown. The present study tested the efficacy of an 8-week Mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR) meditation program compared to a 1-day control seminar on
      CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in stressed HIV infected adults. A single-blind
      randomized controlled trial was conducted with enrollment and follow-up occurring
      between November 2005 and December 2007. A diverse community sample of 48 HIV-1
      infected adults was randomized and entered treatment in either an 8-week MBSR or
      a 1-day control stress reduction education seminar. The primary outcome was
      circulating counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Participants in the 1-day control
      seminar showed declines in CD4+ T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among
      participants in the 8-week MBSR program were unchanged from baseline to
      post-intervention (time x treatment condition interaction, p=.02). This effect
      was independent of antiretroviral (ARV) medication use. Additional analyses
      indicated that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as
      measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness meditation

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a promising adjunctive
      treatment for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      (IBD) and comorbid depression. OBJECTIVES: This pilot randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) aimed to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of an adapted MBCT program for
      AYA, aged 16-29, with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-four AYAs were randomly allocated to
      MBCT (n = 33) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 31). Primary outcome measure was
      the depression score on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes
      included anxiety, stress, IBD-related quality of life, coping, mindfulness,
      post-traumatic growth, medication adherence, IBD activity, inflammatory markers,
      microbiome characteristics and brain functional connectivity. RESULTS: Study
      recruitment rate was 75%, retention rate 70%, and session attendance 92%.
      Intention to treat analyses revealed that, compared to TAU group, MBCT group had
      significantly lower depression (∆ = -6.0; 95%CI = -10.8 to -1.2; P = 0.015) and
      stress (∆ = -5.1; 95%CI = -10.1 to -0.0; P = 0.049), higher active coping
      (∆ = 1.0;95%CI = 0.1-1.9; P = 0.022), and total mindfulness scores
      (∆ = 10.9;95%CI = 1.1-20.8; P = 0.030) at 8 weeks (post-therapy), and improved
      coping by positive reframing (∆ = 1.1;95%CI = 0.0-2.2; P = 0.043) and planning
      (∆ = 0.9;95%CI = 0.0-1.9; P = 0.045), mindful awareness
      (∆ = 5.2.;95%CI = 2.0-8.5; P = 0.002) and total mindfulness scores
      (∆ = 10.8.;95%CI = 0.4-21.1; P = 0.042) at 20 weeks. On per protocol analysis,
      MBCT group had significantly lower depression (∆ = -6.3; 95%CI = -11.4 to -1.2;
      P = 0.015), stress (∆ = -6.0; 95%CI = -11.2 to -0.5; P = 0.032), increased active
      coping (∆ = 0.9;95%CI = 0-1.7; P = 0.05) at 8 weeks, and mindful awareness
      (∆ = 5.4; 95%CI = 2.1-8.6; P = 0.001) at 20 weeks. CONCLUSION: In AYAs with IBD,
      MBCT is feasible and beneficial in improving depression, stress, mindfulness and
      adaptive coping. It holds promise as an important component of integrated IBD
      care. Trial registration number ACTRN12617000876392, U1111-1197-7370;

TI  - The Effect of M-Health-Based Core Stability Exercise Combined with
      Self-Compassion Training for Patients with Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain: A
      Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.
PG  - 511-528
LID - 10.1007/s40122-022-00358-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP) is a leading contributor
      to disease burden worldwide, and the management of NCLBP has always been a
      problem. This study is designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of
      m-health-based core stability exercise (CSE) combined with self-compassion
      training (SCT) and compare it with m-health-based CSE alone for the management of
      NCLBP. METHODS: This study is a pilot, patient-blinded randomized controlled
      trial. Participants with NCLBP were randomized into an intervention group and a
      control group. All the participants received m-health-based CSE, but those in the
      intervention group also received SCT before CSE. The intervention took place
      weekly on Saturday or Sunday for 4 weeks in total. Patients self-assessed their
      outcomes by filling out electronic questionnaires at 4 and 16 weeks after the
      start of the study. The primary outcome metrics for these questionnaires were
      back pain disability (based on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ)
      and Pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS; current pain, worst pain, average
      pain). The secondary outcome metrics were anxiety (GAD-7,7-item Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder scale), Depression Symptoms (PHQ-9,Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9), pain catastrophizing (PCS, Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and
      Self-efficiency (PSEQ, Pain Self-Efficiency Questionnaire). RESULTS: A total of
      37 patients comprising 28 (75.7%) females completed the study, with 19 patients
      in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. The mean (SD) patient age
      was 35.2 (11.1) years. For all primary outcomes, although there were no
      significant differences between groups, we found that participants in the
      intervention group improved function and pain earlier. The RMDQ score changed by
      - 1.771 points (95% CI - 3.768 to 0.227) from baseline to 4 weeks in the control
      group and by - 4.822 points (95% CI - 6.752 to - 2.892) in the intervention group
      (difference between groups, - 3.052 [95% CI - 5.836 to - 0.267]). Also, the RMDQ
      score changed by - 3.328 points (95% CI - 5.252 to - 1.403) from baseline to
      16 weeks in the control group and by - 5.124 points (95% CI - 7.014 to - 3.233)
      in the intervention group (difference between groups - 1.796 [95% CI - 4.501 to
      0.909]). A similar pattern was found in the NRS scores. For secondary outcomes,
      the intervention group was superior to the control group in for GAD-7
      (intervention difference from CSE along at week 16, - 2.156 [95% CI - 4.434
      to - 0.122; P value for group effect was 0.030]). At the end of treatment, the
      improvement in PCS in the intervention group was significant (difference in PCS
      score at week 4, - 6.718 [95% CI - 11.872 to - 1.564]). We also found significant
      changes in PCS in the control group (- 6.326 [95% CI, - 11.250 to - 1.401]) at
      the 16-week follow-up. As for PSEQ, there were no apparent differences between
      the two groups. There were no adverse events relented to study participation.
      CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study is feasible to deliver, and our results indicate
      that participants in the group of m-health-based CSE combined with SCT may
      experience faster relief from pain intensity and back disability than those in
      the group of m-health-based CSE alone. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2100042810.

OAB - The impact of chronic low back pain on people’s life quality and social economy
      is increasing year by year. Helping patients self-manage low back pain through a
      biological-psycho-social model seems to be an effective management approach, but
      the lack of connectivity between disciplines limits the development of
      multidisciplinary collaboration. Mindfulness-related therapy (self-compassion
      training) has been proven to be effective in chronic pain, and exercise therapy
      is widely used in rehabilitation medicine. In this study, these two programs were
      combined. We also used mobile health technology in the study, which brings a lot
      of convenience for research. The results of the study showed that the efficacy of
      the combined group seemed to be more obvious and worthy of further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension and prehypertension have been widely recognized as the
      main contributors of global mortality. Evidence shows mindfulness-based
      interventions may reduce blood pressure and improve mental health. However, the
      effect of mindfulness-based interventions on blood pressure and mental health has
      not been fully understood. METHODS: Potential studies published before May 24th
      2023 were identified by searching Embase, Ovid Emcare, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of
      Science, Cochrane, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang
      database, and VIP China Science. Additionally, two grey databases were searched:
      Mednar, WorldWideScience.org. The risk of bias in the included studies was
      assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool. The random-effects
      meta-analyses were conducted using Review Man 5.4 software and the key outcomes
      are presented as mean difference or standard mean difference and the 95%
      confidential interval. RESULTS: Searches returned 802 studies in total, of which
      12 were included (N = 715). The duration of interventions was 8 weeks in 10
      trials and 6 weeks in one trial. Pooled effect sizes indicated reductions in
      systolic blood pressure (MD = - 9.12, 95% CI [- 12.18, - 6.05], p < 0.001),
      diastolic blood pressure (MD = - 5.66, 95% CI [- 8.88, - 2.43], p < 0.001),
      anxiety (SMD = - 4.10; 95% CI [- 6.49, - 1.71], p < 0.001), depression
      (SMD = - 1.70, 95%CI [- 2.95, - 0.44], p < 0.001) and perceived stress
      (SMD = - 5.91, 95%CI [- 8.74, - 3.09], p < 0.001) at post-intervention. The
      findings from subgroup analyses are favorable for mindfulness-based interventions
      regardless of gender and baseline blood pressure with regard to BP reduction,
      with a more profound effect observed in participants with higher pre-intervention
      blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence for the positive role
      of mindfulness-based interventions in hypertension management. More large
      randomized control trials with sufficient statistical power and long-term
      follow-up are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol had been registered with
      Prospero on October 2nd 2021 (registration NO. CRD42021282504 ).

TI  - A study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial on mindfulness-based
      stress reduction: studying effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction and an
      additional organisational health intervention on mental health and work-related
      perceptions of teachers in Dutch secondary vocational schools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dutch teachers in secondary vocational schools suffer from stress and
      burnout complaints that can cause considerable problems at work. This paper
      presents a study design that can be used to evaluate the short-term and long-term
      effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a person-focused
      intervention, both within and outside of the context of an additional
      organisational health intervention. METHODS: The proposed study comprises a
      cluster randomised controlled trial that will be conducted in at least three
      secondary vocational schools, to which teachers will be recruited from three
      types of courses: Care, Technology, and Economy. The allocation of the
      intervention programme to the participating schools will be randomised. The
      teachers from each school will be assigned to intervention group 1 (IG 1),
      intervention group 2 (IG 2), or the waiting list group (WG). IG 1 will receive
      MBSR training and IG 2 will receive MBSR training combined with an additional
      organisational health intervention. WG, that is the control group, will receive
      MBSR training one year later. The primary outcome variable of the proposed study
      is mindfulness, which will be measured using the Dutch version of the Five Facet
      Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-NL). In the conceptual model, the effects of
      teachers' mindfulness resulting from the intervention programmes (MBSR training
      and MBSR training combined with an additional organisational health intervention)
      will be related to salient (secondary outcome) variables: mental health outcomes
      (e.g., burnout, work engagement), work performance, work-related perceptions (job
      demands and job resources), and personal competencies (e.g., occupational
      self-efficacy). Data will be collected before (T(0)) and immediately after the
      MBSR training (T(1)), and 3 (T(2)) and 9 months (T(3)) after the training. The
      power analysis revealed a required sample size of 66 teachers (22 in each group).
      DISCUSSION: The proposed study aims to provide insight into (1) the short-term
      and long-term effects of MBSR on teachers' mental health, (2) the possible
      enhancing effects of the additional organisational health intervention, and (3)
      the teachers' experiences with the interventions (working mechanisms, steps in
      the mindfulness change process). Strengths of this study design are the use of
      both positive and negative outcomes, the wide range of outcomes, both outcome and
      process measures, longitudinal data, mixed methods, and an integral approach.
      Although the proposed study protocol may not address all weaknesses of current
      studies (e.g., self-selection bias, self-reporting of data, the Hawthorne
      effect), it is innovative in many ways and can be expected to make important
      contributions to both the scientific and practical debate on how to beat
      work-related stress and occupational burnout, and on how to enhance work
      engagement and work performance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register

TI  - Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
      compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in the prevention of
      depressive relapse or recurrence (PREVENT): a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with a history of recurrent depression have a high risk
      of repeated depressive relapse or recurrence. Maintenance antidepressants for at
      least 2 years is the current recommended treatment, but many individuals are
      interested in alternatives to medication. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
      (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk of relapse or recurrence compared with usual
      care, but has not yet been compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in
      a definitive trial. We aimed to see whether MBCT with support to taper or
      discontinue antidepressant treatment (MBCT-TS) was superior to maintenance
      antidepressants for prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence over 24
      months. METHODS: In this single-blind, parallel, group randomised controlled
      trial (PREVENT), we recruited adult patients with three or more previous major
      depressive episodes and on a therapeutic dose of maintenance antidepressants,
      from primary care general practices in urban and rural settings in the UK.
      Participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT-TS or maintenance
      antidepressants (in a 1:1 ratio) with a computer-generated random number sequence
      with stratification by centre and symptomatic status. Participants were aware of
      treatment allocation and research assessors were masked to treatment allocation.
      The primary outcome was time to relapse or recurrence of depression, with
      patients followed up at five separate intervals during the 24-month study period.
      The primary analysis was based on the principle of intention to treat. The trial
      is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN26666654. FINDINGS: Between
      March 23, 2010, and Oct 21, 2011, we assessed 2188 participants for eligibility
      and recruited 424 patients from 95 general practices. 212 patients were randomly
      assigned to MBCT-TS and 212 to maintenance antidepressants. The time to relapse
      or recurrence of depression did not differ between MBCT-TS and maintenance
      antidepressants over 24 months (hazard ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·67-1·18; p=0·43), nor
      did the number of serious adverse events. Five adverse events were reported,
      including two deaths, in each of the MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants
      groups. No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial.
      INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance
      antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals
      at risk for depressive relapse or recurrence. Both treatments were associated
      with enduring positive outcomes in terms of relapse or recurrence, residual
      depressive symptoms, and quality of life. FUNDING: National Institute for Health

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological difficulties, especially depression and anxiety, are
      the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Pharmacological
      treatments for these conditions appear relatively ineffective in Parkinson's
      disease. Mindfulness courses are increasingly popular and recognised as effective
      for managing emotional states, and there is growing evidence for the
      effectiveness of mindfulness courses for people with long-term medical
      conditions. With this exploratory pilot trial, we want to assess the feasibility
      of the procedures and processes, including recruitment, most appropriate outcome
      measure(s), acceptability of type and number of measures, potential nocebo
      effects, and potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a specially
      adapted distance-delivered mindfulness-based intervention in people affected by
      Parkinson's disease. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a pilot two-arm randomised parallel
      group controlled trial. Sixty participants who meet eligibility criteria will be
      randomly assigned either to an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention group or a
      wait-list control group. The mindfulness intervention will include 1-h weekly
      sessions delivered by a health psychologist trained to facilitate mindfulness
      courses. Participants in both groups will complete standardised questionnaires
      assessing anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue, and daily activities at
      four time points (baseline, 4, 8, and 20 weeks). The analysis will also consider
      potential mechanisms of change, such as acceptance, self-compassion, and
      tolerance of uncertainty, as well as health economic outcomes. Participants'
      experiences of the mindfulness interventions will be explored via in-depth
      interviews. DISCUSSION: A mindfulness-based intervention for people with
      Parkinson's delivered remotely, through Skype group videoconferences, may
      represent a viable, more accessible, intervention for people with mobility
      limitations and people who live in rural areas. The trial will provide important
      information about the feasibility, potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and
      acceptability of the intervention as well as mechanisms of psychosocial
      adjustment. The results of this pilot trial will help us design a phase III trial
      to assess efficacy of an online mindfulness-based intervention in Parkinson's
      disease and evaluate significance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a 4-week web-based acceptance and commitment
      therapy (ACT) mental health promotion program called YOLO (You Only Live Once)
      for university students. METHOD: A total of 130 participants were randomized to
      one of three intervention groups investigating varied program delivery methods.
      Primary outcomes assessed: depression, anxiety, stress, well-being,
      self-compassion, alcohol use, and life satisfaction. ACT processes assessed:
      acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and mindfulness.
      RESULTS: Improvement on the primary outcomes and ACT processes did not differ
      among the three intervention groups. Analyses showed significant improvements on
      all primary outcomes (except alcohol use), and on all ACT processes. All ACT
      processes mediated changes on one or more primary outcomes in the intent-to-treat
      sample. Intervention effects were consistent on most primary outcomes and ACT
      processes across three sample groupings. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings
      provide support for a web-based ACT mental health promotion program for
      university students.

TI  - Application of Positive Psychology in Digital Interventions for Children,
      Adolescents, and Young Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled
      Trials.
PG  - e56045

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of mental health issues in children,
      adolescents, and young adults has become an escalating public health issue,
      impacting approximately 10%-20% of young people on a global scale. Positive
      psychology interventions (PPIs) can act as powerful mental health promotion tools
      to reach wide-ranging audiences that might otherwise be challenging to access.
      This increased access would enable prevention of mental disorders and promotion
      of widespread well-being by enhancing self-efficacy, thereby supporting the
      achievement of tangible objectives. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a
      comprehensive synthesis of all randomized controlled trials and controlled trials
      involving children, adolescents, and young adults, encompassing both clinical and
      nonclinical populations, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of digital
      PPIs in this age group. METHODS: After a literature search in 9 electronic
      databases until January 12, 2023, and gray literature until April 2023, we
      carried out a systematic review of 35 articles, of which 18 (51%) provided data
      for the meta-analysis. We included randomized controlled trials and controlled
      trials mainly based on web-based, digital, or smartphone-based interventions
      using a positive psychology framework as the main component. Studies included
      participants with a mean age of <35 years. Outcomes of PPIs were classified into
      indicators of well-being (compassion, life satisfaction, optimism, happiness,
      resilience, emotion regulation and emotion awareness, hope, mindfulness, purpose,
      quality of life, gratitude, empathy, forgiveness, motivation, and kindness) and
      ill-being (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and burnout). PRISMA
      (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines
      were used for the selection of studies and data extraction. Quality assessment
      was performed following the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)
      guidelines. RESULTS: For well-being outcomes, meta-analytic results showed that
      PPIs augmented the feeling of purpose, gratitude, and hope (Hedges g=0.555),
      compassion (Hedges g=0.447), positive coping behaviors (Hedges g=0.421), body
      image-related outcomes (Hedges g=0.238), and positive mindset predisposition
      (Hedges g=0.304). For ill-being outcomes, PPIs reduced cognitive biases (Hedges
      g=-0.637), negative emotions and mood (Hedges g=-0.369), and stress levels
      (Hedges g=-0.342). Of note, larger effect sizes were found when a waiting list
      control group was considered versus a digital control group. A funnel plot showed
      no publication bias. Meta-regression analyses showed that PPIs tended to show a
      larger effect size on well-being outcomes in studies including young adults,
      whereas no specific effect was found for ill-being outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Revised
      evidence suggests that PPIs benefit young people's well-being and mitigate
      ill-being symptoms. Digital platforms offer a unique way to address their mental
      health challenges, although not without limitations. Future research should
      explore how they work for the needs of the young population and further examine
      what specific PPIs or combination of interventions is most beneficial with
      respect to other digital control groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

AB  - Mindfulness training has been shown to improve psychological health and general
      well-being. However, it is unclear which brain and personality systems may be
      affected by this practice for improving adaptive behavior and quality of life.
      The present study explores the effects of a 5-week mindfulness-based intervention
      (MBI) at the neuroanatomical level and its relationship with dispositional
      mindfulness and impulsivity. Sixty-six risky drivers were quasi-randomly assigned
      to a mindfulness training group (MT) or a control group (N). Participants
      underwent magnetic resonance imaging and completed the Five Facet Mindfulness
      Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the UPPS-P impulsivity scale twice, at baseline and
      after receiving the MBI. We observed that MBI changes dispositional mindfulness
      in the non-reactivity and observing facets. Further, we observed that the
      magnitude of change in impulsivity was associated with the change in
      dispositional mindfulness. Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed that the
      volume of the right caudate nucleus of the MT group (n = 27) showed a reduction
      compared to that of the control group (n = 33), which increased in terms of the
      pre-post measurement (MT=-1.76 mm(3); N = 6.31 mm(3)). We also observed that
      reduced caudate nucleus volume correlated with decreased positive urgency in the
      MT group. Taken together, our results show that MBI improves the skills of
      observing and non-reactivity to inner experience, while producing changes in the
      structure of the caudate nucleus. These structural changes are associated with a
      reduction in impulsivity levels, decreasing the tendency to act rashly in
      situations that generate positive emotions and thus facilitating more adaptive
      behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many breast cancer survivors suffer from cognitive complaints after
      cancer treatment, affecting their quality of life. The objective of this pilot
      study was to investigate the effect of a blended-care mindfulness-based
      intervention (MBI) on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and functional
      brain changes. Furthermore, correlations between changes in cognitive functioning
      and self-reported behavioral factors were investigated. METHODS: Breast cancer
      survivors (n = 33) who reported cognitive impairment were randomly allocated to a
      mindfulness condition (n = 18) or a waitlist control condition (n = 15). Patients
      completed questionnaires on cognitive impairment, emotional distress, and
      fatigue; neuropsychological tests; and resting-state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging before the start of MBI (time 1 [T1]), immediately after the
      completion of an 8-week MBI program (T2), and 3 months postintervention (T3).
      Resting-state functional connectivity was estimated in the default mode network,
      the dorsal and salience attention networks, and the frontoparietal network. Mixed
      model repeated-measures analysis was performed to test the intervention effect.
      RESULTS: Patients in the mindfulness condition exhibited significantly higher
      connectivity between the dorsal and salience attention networks after the
      mindfulness intervention compared with those in the control condition. MBI
      participants also had reduced subjective cognitive impairment, emotional
      distress, and fatigue. No intervention effect was observed on neurocognitive
      tests. CONCLUSIONS: MBI may induce functional brain changes in networks related
      to attention and may have a positive effect on subjective measures of cognitive
      impairment in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, MBI could be a suitable
      intervention to improve quality of life in this population and deserves further
      study in this context.

TI  - Effects of an integrated childbirth education program to reduce fear of
      childbirth, anxiety, and depression, and improve dispositional mindfulness: A
      single-blind randomised controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an integrated childbirth education
      intervention on reducing childbirth fear, anxiety, and depression, and improving
      dispositional mindfulness. DESIGN: A two-arm parallel, single-blind randomised
      controlled trial. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS:
      Pregnant women ≥ 20 years of age with a singleton pregnancy (12-24 weeks
      gestation) and their support partners were recruited. All women included in the
      study had a score of ≥ 7 points on a fear of childbirth visual analogue scale.
      INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group (n = 53) received an 8-week course in a
      childbirth education programme, which included (1) childbirth education using
      simulation-based learning that highlighted coping with labour pain and (2)
      instruction in mindfulness breathing, body scans, stretching, sitting meditation,
      and mindfulness walking. Support partners were invited to participate. The
      control group (n = 53) received the usual standard prenatal care. MEASUREMENTS:
      The primary outcome of fear of childbirth was assessed using the Wijma Delivery
      Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes of anxiety,
      depression, and dispositional mindfulness were assessed with the Edinburgh
      Postpartum Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale, and the Mindful
      Attention Awareness Scale, respectively. Repeated data were collected at
      baseline, 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. FINDINGS: Ninety-one mothers
      completed the study, with a mean age of 33.9 years (SD = 4.4), and most were
      primipara (n = 83). The baseline measurements did not differ between the groups.
      Compared with the control group, there were significant differences in all
      measures from baseline for the intervention group: the scores were significantly
      lower for fear of childbirth (mean difference (MD) =-14.8 ∼ -23.7, p < .01),
      symptoms of anxiety (MD =-7.4 ∼ -6.4, p < .01), and depression (MD =-3.7 ∼ -3.5,
      p < .01); the levels of dispositional mindfulness were significantly higher (MD
      =4.9 ∼ 5.7, p < .01) at 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. CONCLUSION AND
      IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The 8-week integrated childbirth education
      intervention was effective in reducing the fear of childbirth in pregnant women.
      The mindfulness techniques were easily learnt and applied by the participants.
      Using these techniques during pregnancy and labour enhanced participants' mental
      health and coping. The integrated childbirth education which includes pregnant
      women and their support partners could be easily taught by midwives in other
      contexts.

AB  - CONTEXT: Pain is the most fearful symptom in cancer. Although there is a
      relationship between psychosocial variables and oncologic pain, psychological and
      non-pharmacological treatments for pain management in cancer patients are not
      very widespread. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the efficacy of psychological and
      non-pharmacological treatments for reducing pain in cancer patients. METHODS: We
      performed a systematic review following the PRISMA protocol. In January 2021,
      data were extracted from PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, including randomised
      controlled trials (RCT) published in the last five years (from 28 January, 2015
      to December 15, 2020), in the English language and whose sample was patients with
      cancer pain. The database search used the following keywords: cancer,
      cancer-related pain, psychological intervention, non-pharmacologic intervention.
      The Cochrane risk of bias assess ment for randomised trials (RoB 2) was used for
      quality appraisal. RESULTS: After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were
      applied, ten papers were fully screened. The evidence suggested that the most
      effective interventions to reduce cancer pain were mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation and emotional and
      symptom focused engagement (EASE). Music therapy and brief cognitive behavioral
      strategies (CBS) require more research, while coping skills training and yoga did
      not show positive effects. Overall, we obtained a moderate size effect
      (d = 0.642, 95% CI: 0.125-1.158) favourable to psychological and
      non-pharmacologic treatments at post-treatment, which increased at follow-up
      (k = 5, d = 0.826, 95% CI: 0.141-1.511). CONCLUSION: This study provides insight
      into psychological interventions which might be applied and contribute to
      cancer-related pain reduction in adults. Although the results are not completely
      consistent, they may shed light on psychology applications in the oncology
      environment.

TI  - A Virtual Resiliency Intervention Promoting Resiliency for Parents of Children
      with Learning and Attentional Disabilities: A Randomized Pilot Trial.
PG  - 39-53
LID - 10.1007/s10995-019-02815-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: One in five children have a learning and attentional disability
      (LAD). Parents of children with LAD are vulnerable to distress, but an
      evidence-based treatment has not been developed. METHODS: From June 2016 to
      November 2017, we conducted a mixed methods study to adapt and assess the virtual
      delivery of a mind-body group resiliency program, the Stress Management and
      Resiliency Training-Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP), to meet
      the needs of parents of children with LAD; this is an 8-session weekly group
      intervention. In the first phase, we conducted 4 parent focus group interviews, 2
      professional focus group interviews, and 5 professional individual interviews,
      and 1 pilot group to adapt the SMART-3RP to target the needs of parents of
      children with LAD. In the second phase, we conducted a pilot wait-list controlled
      study to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a
      videoconferencing delivery of the adapted program. Parents were randomized to an
      immediate intervention group (IG) or wait-list control group (WC). Surveys were
      administered at baseline (time 1), end of intervention for the IG or 3 months
      post-baseline for the WC (time 2), and 3 months post treatment for the IG or end
      of intervention for the WC (time 3). RESULTS: Qualitative findings illustrated
      high levels of parental stress, with primary stressors including navigating the
      educational system, interactions with other parents, familial concerns, and
      financial and professional sacrifices. We adapted the manual to target these
      stressors and modified session logistics and delivery. Fifty-three parents (mean
      age = 46.8; 90.6% female) participated nationally in the pilot trial. 62.5% of
      participants completed ≥ 6/8 sessions; 81.8% reported continued daily/weekly
      relaxation response exercise practice. T1-T2 comparisons found that IG versus WC
      participants showed significant improvements in distress [VAS], ∆M = - 1.95;
      d = .83 and resilience [CES], ∆M = 6.38; d = .83, as well as stress coping
      [MOCS-A] ∆M = 8.69; d = 1.39; depression and anxiety [PHQ-4], ∆M = - 1.79;
      d = .71; social support [MOS-SSS], ∆M = 5.47; d = .71; and empathy [IRI],
      ∆M = 3.17; d = .77; improvements were sustained at the 3 month post intervention
      follow-up. CONCLUSION: Pilot wait-list randomized trial findings showed promising
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy for the SMART-3RP
      intervention adapted for parents of children with LAD. This virtually-delivered
      resiliency intervention improved parents' distress, resiliency, and stress
      coping, which were sustained. CLINICAL TRIALS ID: NCT02772432.

AB  - The impact of childhood experiences on the development of psychopathology is well
      established in the literature. Few studies, however, have assessed parental
      bonding during childhood as a predictor of response to anxiety disorders
      treatment. The aim of the study was to examine whether emotional memories of
      childhood parenting could predict short-term and long-term outcome in three
      different interventions for patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD):
      mindfulness-based intervention (Body in Mind Training [BMT]), fluoxetine (FLX),
      and an active control group (quality of life [QoL]). A total of 124 participants
      from a randomized controlled trial for GAD treatment were evaluated pre- and
      post-treatment and after 18 months. Patients were assessed for the severity of
      GAD symptoms (GAD-7, PSWQ, and DERS), early memories of warmth and safeness
      (EMWSS), and recall of perceived threat and subordination/submission in childhood
      (ELES). Negative childhood memories predicted a greater reduction in anxiety
      symptoms on BMT treatment compared to FLX and QoL, whereas positive childhood
      memories predicted more symptomatic improvement in the QoL group. Our findings
      suggest that individuals with GAD who have early memories of subordination and
      threat appear to benefit more from interventions that focus on developing
      emotion-regulation strategies and enhancing self-compassion, such as
      mindfulness-based interventions.

AB  - ObjectiveWith high rates of mental health concerns on college campuses, effective
      positive psychology interventions could greatly improve student well-being and
      academic outcomes. Participants: Working undergraduates (N = 52). Methods: This
      preliminary, randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of the 8-week
      Mindfulness-based strengths practice (MBSP) on Seligman's five domains of
      well-being, as measured by the PERMA-Profiler, Workplace PERMA-Profiler, and
      student retention in working undergraduates. Results: Students in the MBSP
      intervention had significantly higher well-being, engagement, meaning, and health
      following the MBSP program (P < 0.0042). No such changes were observed in the
      control group. Students in the intervention group also had modestly higher
      retention rates in the following academic year than those in the control group.
      Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence to date that an MBSP program
      can improve college student well-being and retention.

TI  - Regulation of Mindfulness-Based Music Listening on Negative Emotions Related to
      COVID-19: An ERP Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18137063 [doi]
LID - 7063
AB  - The current study aimed to explore the behavioral and neural correlates of
      mindfulness-based music listening regulation of induced negative emotions related
      to COVID-19 using the face-word Stroop task. Eighty-five young adults visited the
      laboratory and were randomly assigned to three groups: a calm music group (CMG: n
      = 28), a happy music group (HMG: n = 30), and a sad music group (SMG: n = 27).
      Negative emotions were induced in all participants using a COVID-19 video,
      followed by the music intervention condition. Participants underwent the
      face-word Stroop tasks during which event-related potentials (ERPs) were
      recorded. The N2, N3, P3, and late positive component (LPC) were investigated.
      The results showed that calm music and happy music effectively regulate young
      adults' induced negative emotions, while young adults experienced more negative
      emotions when listening to sad music; the negative mood states at the
      post-induction phase inhibited the reaction of conflict control in face-word
      Stroop tasks, which manifested as lower accuracy (ACC) and slower reaction times
      (RTs). ERP results showed negative mood states elicited greater N2, N3, and LPC
      amplitudes and smaller P3 amplitudes. Further studies are needed to develop
      intervention strategies to enhance emotion regulation related to COVID-19 for
      other groups.

TI  - Testing the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce emotional
      distress in outpatients with diabetes (DiaMind): design of a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-11-131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 20-40% of outpatients with diabetes experience elevated
      levels of emotional distress, varying from disease-specific distress to general
      symptoms of anxiety and depression. The patient's emotional well-being is related
      to other unfavorable outcomes, like reduced quality of life, sub-optimal
      self-care, impaired glycemic control, higher risk of complications, and increased
      mortality rates. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a new
      diabetes-specific, mindfulness-based psychological intervention. First, with
      regard to reducing emotional distress; second, with respect to improving quality
      of life, dispositional mindfulness, and self-esteem of patients with diabetes;
      third, with regard to self-care and clinical outcomes; finally, a potential
      effect modification by clinical and personality characteristics will be explored.
      METHODS/DESIGN: The Diabetes and Mindfulness study (DiaMind) is a randomized
      controlled trial. Patients with diabetes with low levels of emotional well-being
      will be recruited from outpatient diabetes clinics. Eligible patients will be
      randomized to an intervention group or a wait-list control group. The
      intervention group will receive the mindfulness program immediately, while the
      control group will receive the program eight months later. The primary outcome is
      emotional distress (anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms), for which data will be
      collected at baseline, four weeks, post intervention, and after six months
      follow-up. In addition, self-report data will be collected on quality of life,
      dispositional mindfulness, self-esteem, self-care, and personality, while
      complications and glycemic control will be assessed from medical files and blood
      pressure will be measured. Group differences will be analyzed with repeated
      measures analysis of covariance.The study is supported by grants from the Dutch
      Diabetes Research Foundation and Tilburg University and has been approved by a
      medical ethics committee. DISCUSSION: It is hypothesized that emotional
      well-being, quality of life, dispositional mindfulness, self-esteem, self-care,
      and blood pressure will improve significantly more in the mindfulness group
      compared to the control group. Results of this study can contribute to a better
      care for patients with diabetes with lowered levels of emotional well-being. It
      is expected that the first results will become available in 2012. TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NTR2145.

TI  - The SCD-Well randomized controlled trial: Effects of a mindfulness-based
      intervention versus health education on mental health in patients with subjective
      cognitive decline (SCD).
PG  - 737-745
LID - 10.1016/j.trci.2018.10.010 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Subjectively experienced cognitive decline in older adults is an
      indicator of increased risk for dementia and is also associated with increased
      levels of anxiety symptoms. As anxiety is itself emerging as a risk factor for
      cognitive decline and dementia, the primary question of the present study is
      whether an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention can significantly reduce anxiety
      symptoms in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The secondary
      questions pertain to whether such changes extend to other domains of
      psychological, social, and biological functioning (including cognition,
      self-regulation, lifestyle, well-being and quality of life, sleep, and selected
      blood-based biomarkers) associated with mental health, older age, and risk for
      dementia. METHODS: SCD-Well is a multicenter, observer-blinded, randomized,
      controlled, superiority trial, which is part of the Horizon 2020 European
      Union-funded "Medit-Ageing" project. SCD-Well compares an 8-week mindfulness- and
      compassion-based intervention specifically adapted for older adults with SCD with
      a validated 8-week health education program. Participants were recruited from
      memory clinics in four European sites (Cologne, Germany; London, United Kingdom;
      Barcelona, Spain; and Lyon, France) and randomized with a 1:1 allocation,
      stratified by site. RESULTS: The primary outcome, change in anxiety symptoms, and
      secondary outcomes reflecting psychological, cognitive, social, and biological
      functioning are assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 4 months after the
      end of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will provide evidence on whether a
      mindfulness-based intervention can effect changes in anxiety and other risk
      factors for cognitive decline and dementia in older adults with SCD and will
      inform the establishment of intervention strategies targeted at improving mental
      health in older adults.

TI  - Online yoga to reduce post traumatic stress in women who have experienced
      stillbirth: a randomized control feasibility trial.

LID - 173
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 1 in every 150 pregnancies end in stillbirth. Consequences
      include symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and
      anxiety. Yoga has been used to treat PTSD in other populations and may improve
      health outcomes for stillbirth mothers. The purpose of this study was to
      determine: (a) feasibility of a 12-week home-based, online yoga intervention with
      varying doses; (b) acceptability of a "stretch and tone" control group; and (c)
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention on reducing symptoms of PTSD, anxiety,
      depression, perinatal grief, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindfulness,
      sleep quality, and subjective health. METHODS: Participants (N = 90) were
      recruited nationally and randomized into one of three groups for yoga or exercise
      (low dose (LD), 60 min per week; moderate dose (MD), 150 min per week; and
      stretch-and-tone control group (STC)). Baseline and post-intervention surveys
      measured main outcomes (listed above). Frequency analyses were used to determine
      feasibility. Repeated measures ANCOVA were used to determine preliminary
      efficacy. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine a dose-response
      relationship between minutes of yoga and each outcome variable. RESULTS: Over
      half of participants completed the intervention (n = 48/90). Benchmarks (≥70%
      reported > 75% satisfaction) were met in each group for satisfaction and
      enjoyment. Participants meeting benchmarks (completing > 90% of prescribed
      minutes 9/12 weeks) for LD and MD groups were 44% (n = 8/18) and 6% (n = 1/16),
      respectively. LD and MD groups averaged 44.0 and 77.3 min per week of yoga,
      respectively. The MD group reported that 150 prescribed minutes per week of yoga
      was too much. There were significant decreases in PTSD and depression, and
      improvements in self-rated health at post-intervention for both intervention
      groups. There was a significant difference in depression scores (p = .036) and
      grief intensity (p = .009) between the MD and STC groups. PTSD showed
      non-significant decreases of 43% and 56% at post-intervention in LD and MD
      groups, respectively (22% decrease in control). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first
      study to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an online yoga
      intervention for women after stillbirth. Future research warrants a randomized
      controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT02925481. Registered

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Elder Care (MBEC) on symptoms of depression and
      anxiety and spiritual well-being of institutionalized seniors with disabilities:
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 497

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the need to incorporate seniors from various settings into
      mindfulness-based empirical research, issues of geriatric frailties and
      non-compliance remain. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a
      mindfulness-based elder care (MBEC) program on mental health and spiritual
      well-being among seniors with disabilities in long-term care residential
      settings. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) randomly
      assigned seventy-seven participants into an MBEC group or control group of an
      eight-week MBEC program. Participants were assessed every four weeks at baseline
      (T(0)), mid-intervention (T(1)), post-intervention (T(2)) and follow-up (T(3))
      using the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-SF), the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), respectively.
      RESULTS: Linear mixed model (LMM) showed that MBEC participants' mental health
      improved significantly after completing the intervention; compared with controls,
      the MBEC group exhibited significantly lower anxiety (state-anxiety at T(2);
      trait-anxiety at T(2) and T(3)) and fewer depressive symptoms. Spiritual
      well-being was also significantly enhanced compared to that in the control group.
      CONCLUSIONS: MBEC has positive effects on both mental health and spiritual
      well-being outcomes among seniors with disabilities. In long-term care
      facilities, seniors with abilities have the potential to adhere to and engage in
      activities of a mindfulness-based intervention. This low risk, easily accessible,
      and effective 8-week program is recommended to be integrated into regular
      long-term care institutional routines. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was
      registered with Clinical Trial Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov - U.S. National
      Library of Medicine #NCT05123261. Retrospectively registered on 07/04/2021.). The
      CONSORT 2010 guidelines were used in this study for properly reporting how the
      randomized trial was conducted.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation and improvement in sleep quality and daytime impairment
      among older adults with sleep disturbances: a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 494-501
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.8081 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Sleep disturbances are most prevalent among older adults and often go
      untreated. Treatment options for sleep disturbances remain limited, and there is
      a need for community-accessible programs that can improve sleep. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the efficacy of a mind-body medicine intervention, called mindfulness
      meditation, to promote sleep quality in older adults with moderate sleep
      disturbances. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial with 2
      parallel groups conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2012, at a medical
      research center among an older adult sample (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [7.4] years)
      with moderate sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] >5).
      INTERVENTIONS: A standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) intervention (n
      = 24) or a sleep hygiene education (SHE) intervention (n = 25) was randomized to
      participants, who received a 6-week intervention (2 hours per week) with assigned
      homework. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study was powered to detect
      between-group differences in moderate sleep disturbance measured via the PSQI at
      postintervention. Secondary outcomes pertained to sleep-related daytime
      impairment and included validated measures of insomnia symptoms, depression,
      anxiety, stress, and fatigue, as well as inflammatory signaling via nuclear
      factor (NF)-κB. RESULTS: Using an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the
      MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to those in the SHE group on
      the PSQI. With the MAPs intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.7) at
      baseline and 7.4 (1.9) at postintervention. With the SHE intervention, the mean
      (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.8) at baseline and 9.1 (2.0) at postintervention. The
      between-group mean difference was 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6-2.9), with an effect size of
      0.89. The MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to the SHE group on
      secondary health outcomes of insomnia symptoms, depression symptoms, fatigue
      interference, and fatigue severity (P < .05 for all). Between-group differences
      were not observed for anxiety, stress, or NF-κB, although NF-κB concentrations
      significantly declined over time in both groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: The use of a community-accessible MAPs intervention resulted in
      improvements in sleep quality at immediate postintervention, which was superior
      to a highly structured SHE intervention. Formalized mindfulness-based
      interventions have clinical importance by possibly serving to remediate sleep
      problems among older adults in the short term, and this effect appears to carry
      over into reducing sleep-related daytime impairment that has implications for
      quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01534338.

TI  - Interoception in Psychiatric Disorders: A Review of Randomized, Controlled Trials
      with Interoception-Based Interventions.
PG  - 250-263
LID - 10.1097/HRP.0000000000000170 [doi]
AB  - Interoception, or the process of sensing, interpreting, and integrating internal
      bodily signals, has increasingly been the subject of scientific research over the
      past decade but is still not well known in clinical practice. The aim of this
      article is to review clinical treatment interventions that use interoception, to
      synthesize the current research knowledge, and to identify the gaps where future
      research is needed. We conducted a comprehensive literature search on randomized,
      controlled trials that both include interoception in treatment interventions for
      individuals with psychiatric disorders and measure aspects of interoception using
      self-report measures. Out of 14 randomized, controlled trials identified, 7 found
      that interventions with interoception were effective in ameliorating symptoms.
      These studies included individuals with anxiety disorders, eating disorders,
      psychosomatic disorders, and addictive disorders. All of the intervention studies
      with positive clinical outcomes also demonstrated changes on interoceptive
      measures; however, these measures were often related to specific illness
      symptoms. Interoception may be a mechanism of action in improving clinical
      symptomatology, though studies incorporating general, symptom-independent
      interoceptive measures remain scarce. To further our understanding of the role
      interoception has in psychiatric disorders and their treatment, more studies
      integrating interoceptive measures are needed, along with a clearer definition of
      interoceptive terms used.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy to Prevent Suicide
      (MBCT-S) is associated with improvement in attentional control, an objective
      marker of suicide attempt. METHOD: In the context of a randomized clinical trial
      targeting suicide risk in Veterans, computerized Stroop and emotion Stroop
      (E-Stroop) tasks were administered 3 times over 6-months follow-up to 135 high
      suicide risk Veterans. Seventy were randomized to receive MBCT-S in addition to
      enhanced treatment as usual (eTAU), and 65 were randomized to eTAU only. E-Stroop
      word types included positively- and negatively-valenced emotion, suicide, and
      combat-related words. Interference scores and mixed effects linear regression
      analyses were used. RESULTS: Veterans receiving MBCT-S showed a more favorable
      trajectory of attentional control over time, as indicated by performance on two
      E-Stroop tasks. Combat-stress interference scores improved over time among
      Veterans in MBCT-S. Interference processing time for negative affective words
      deteriorated over time among Veterans receiving eTAU only. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT-S
      may effectively target attentional control, and in particular reduce processing
      time during affective interference, in high suicide risk Veterans. Future studies
      to replicate these findings are warranted.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Quality of Life, Psychological Distress,
      and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies in Patients With Breast Cancer Under
      Early Chemotherapy-a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 131-142
LID - 10.1097/HNP.0000000000000580 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been receiving growing attention in
      cancer care. This study evaluated the impact of the mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) on quality of life, psychological distress (anxiety and
      depression), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in patients with breast
      cancer under early chemotherapy. A total of 101 patients with breast cancer under
      early chemotherapy were randomly assigned to either an 8-week MBSR group (n = 50)
      or a control group (n = 51). The primary outcome was quality of life, measured on
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer. The secondary outcomes
      were anxiety (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-rating Depression
      Scale), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (The Chinese version of
      Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire). The participants were assessed at
      baseline (T0) and week 8 (T1). The data were statistically analyzed by SPSS 21.0.
      The participants in the MBSR group experienced significantly better outcomes in
      their quality of life, psychological distress, and cognitive emotion regulation
      strategies than the control group. The MBSR intervention was demonstrated to
      improve the positive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and quality of life
      in patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy and significantly reduce
      the patient's anxiety, depression, and negative cognitive emotion regulation
      strategies, and help the patients to adjust their mental state and promote
      positive psychology to improve their quality of life.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction adapted to pregnant women with psychosocial
      vulnerabilities-a protocol for a randomized feasibility study in a Danish
      hospital-based outpatient setting.
PG  - 118
LID - 10.1186/s40814-021-00860-w [doi]
LID - 118
AB  - BACKGROUND: This protocol is for a feasibility study of a mindfulness-based
      stress reduction (MBSR) program adapted for pregnant women with psychosocial
      vulnerabilities. The rationale for the study is the need for a wider array of
      evidence-based options to address prenatal mental health care needs in pregnant
      women. MBSR is a promising mental health intervention but has not yet been
      adapted for pregnant women with the aim of addressing prenatal mental health. The
      purpose is thus to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes
      of an adapted MBSR program, prenatal MBSR, compared to usual care to inform a
      randomized controlled trial. METHODS/DESIGN: Pregnant women (n = 60) referred to
      an outpatient clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre,
      Denmark, will be recruited for the study. The design is a single-center
      feasibility trial, with prenatal MBSR, as an add-on to usual care. The primary
      outcome is to assess the feasibility of a full-scale randomized controlled trial.
      The secondary feasibility outcome includes possible effects of the adapted MBSR
      program estimated by self-report questionnaires measuring stress, anxiety,
      depression, well-being, decentering, reflective functioning, mindfulness, and
      compassion. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to prenatal MBSR or
      usual care. DISCUSSION: The study is part of the Good Start to Family Life study
      anchored at Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark.
      Teaching the skills of mindfulness meditation to a psychosocially vulnerable
      group of pregnant women could prove a viable and non-pharmacological approach to
      reduce stress, improve mental health, and provide support in the transition to
      parenthood. The outcomes of the feasibility study will inform the design of a
      fully powered randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04571190 . Registered on September 30, 2020.

TI  - A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Online-Treatment with
      Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and Positive
      Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A
      Study Protocol.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19020819 [doi]
LID - 819
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests the use of different forms of therapy as a way of
      decreasing dropout rates in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). The psychotherapies to be assessed in this study are trial-based
      cognitive therapy (TBCT), mindfulness-based health promotion (MBHP) and positive
      psychotherapy (PPT). OBJECTIVES: (1) to assess the online efficacy of TBCT
      compared to MBHP and PPT to reduce the symptoms of PTSD in the context of the
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; (2) to compare the efficacy of
      these psychotherapies in improving anxiety, depression, guilt and in promoting
      well-being; and (3) to describe how professionals perceive online treatment.
      METHODS: A randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical trial will be
      conducted, with three separate arms. An estimated sample of 135 patients will
      receive either TBCT, MBHP or PPT and will be treated through online, individual,
      weekly visits, totaling 14 sessions. The primary outcome will be CAPS-5 and
      secondary outcomes will be HADS and WHO-5. The variables used to mediate these
      outcomes will be the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI), Negative Core Beliefs
      Inventory (NCBI) and the California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS-P).
      EXPECTED RESULTS: PTSD symptoms are expected to be reduced after TBCT, MBHP and
      PPT. No statistical difference is expected to be found among the three.
      DISCUSSION: The present study will evaluate and contribute towards the
      development of new psychotherapeutic options for patients with PTSD. The results
      of this study will allow the dissemination of new effective and adaptable
      interventions for patients with PTSD.
