TI  - Effects of a mindfulness-based versus a health self-management intervention on 
      objective cognitive performance in older adults with subjective cognitive decline 
      (SCD): a secondary analysis of the SCD-Well randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) perceive 
      that their cognition has declined but do not show objective impairment on 
      neuropsychological tests. Individuals with SCD are at elevated risk of objective 
      cognitive decline and incident dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions 
      (including mindfulness-based and health self-management approaches) are a 
      potential strategy to maintain or improve cognition in SCD, which may ultimately 
      reduce dementia risk. METHODS: This study utilized data from the SCD-Well 
      randomized controlled trial. One hundred forty-seven older adults with SCD 
      (M(Age) = 72.7 years; 64% female) were recruited from memory clinics in four 
      European countries and randomized to one of two group-based, 8-week 
      interventions: a Caring Mindfulness-based Approach for Seniors (CMBAS) or a 
      health self-management program (HSMP). Participants were assessed at baseline, 
      post-intervention (week 8), and at 6-month follow-up (week 24) using a range of 
      cognitive tests. From these tests, three composites were derived-an "abridged" 
      Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5(Abridged)), an attention 
      composite, and an executive function composite. Both per-protocol and 
      intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Linear mixed models evaluated the 
      change in outcomes between and within arms and adjusted for covariates and 
      cognitive retest effects. Sensitivity models repeated the per-protocol analyses 
      for participants who attended ≥ 4 intervention sessions. RESULTS: Across all 
      cognitive composites, there were no significant time-by-trial arm interactions 
      and no measurable cognitive retest effects; sensitivity analyses supported these 
      results. Improvements, however, were observed within both trial arms on the 
      PACC5(Abridged) from baseline to follow-up (Δ [95% confidence interval]: CMBAS = 
      0.34 [0.19, 0.48]; HSMP = 0.30 [0.15, 0.44]). There was weaker evidence of an 
      improvement in attention but no effects on executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Two 
      non-pharmacological interventions conferred small, non-differing improvements to 
      a global cognitive composite sensitive to amyloid-beta-related decline. There was 
      weaker evidence of an effect on attention, and no evidence of an effect on 
      executive function. Importantly, observed improvements were maintained beyond the 
      end of the interventions. Improving cognition is an important step toward 
      dementia prevention, and future research is needed to delineate the mechanisms of 
      action of these interventions and to utilize clinical endpoints (i.e., 
      progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia). TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03005652.

TI  - Enhancing relaxation states and positive emotions in physicians through a 
      mindfulness training program: A one-year study.
PG  - 720-31
LID - 10.1080/13548506.2014.986143 [doi]
AB  - Previous research on mindfulness has focused mainly on stress-related negative 
      symptoms and short-term effects. In contrast, the present article focuses on the 
      impact of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on improving 
      well-being (i.e. relaxation states and related positive emotions) in a 
      longitudinal study for a period of one year. A randomized controlled trial in a 
      sample of 42 physicians was used. The intervention group participated in an 
      8-week MBSR program, with an additional 10-month maintenance period and completed 
      measures of mindfulness and relaxation at pre-intervention, post-intervention and 
      after 10 months. Heart rate measures were also obtained. Significant improvements 
      in favor of the experimental group compared with the control group on the levels 
      of mindfulness and relaxation (including positive emotional states, such as at 
      ease/peace, renewal, energy, optimism, happiness, acceptance, and even 
      transcendence) were obtained after eight weeks. Remarkably, change magnitudes 
      (effect size) significantly increased at the end of the maintenance period after 
      a year, especially for mindfulness and positive energy. Additionally, heart rate 
      significantly decreased for the intervention group and maintained a year after 
      the beginning of the treatment. Results are relevant in terms of practical 
      consequences for improving health and well-being in this population and also in 
      terms of cost-efficiency.

TI  - The efficacy of mindfulness-based programs in reducing anxiety among nurses in 
      hospital settings: A systematic review.
PG  - 395-406
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12722 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing pressure of their professional duties has led to a 
      notable concern regarding the mounting anxiety levels among nurses. The ongoing 
      discussion revolves around the efficacy of mindfulness as a means to alleviate 
      anxiety in nurses. AIM: This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of 
      mindfulness in reducing anxiety among nurses. METHODS: The evaluation followed 
      the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses. An extensive and comprehensive search was conducted across eight 
      databases to identify studies that utilized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      and were published in English between 2011 and 2022. Independently, two reviewers 
      assessed the validity of the randomized controlled trials using the Consolidated 
      Standards of Reporting Trials criteria. Additionally, two authors independently 
      employed the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-2) 
      method to evaluate the potential bias in the RCTs. RESULTS: Eight randomized 
      controlled trial studies that were deemed eligible were included in the current 
      analysis. Based on the literature review, it was determined that 
      mindfulness-based training can assist nurses in reducing their anxiety levels. 
      Furthermore, the effectiveness of mindfulness-based programs in enhancing nurses' 
      mindfulness and self-compassion has been firmly established. LINKING EVIDENCE TO 
      ACTION: Based on existing literature, mindfulness-based interventions have proven 
      to be effective in reducing anxiety levels among nurses. However, in order to 
      enhance the overall quality of research, it is necessary to implement more 
      rigorous controlled designs that include randomization. Additionally, larger 
      sample sizes with a diverse range of participants are needed to establish and 
      validate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based programs in alleviating anxiety 
      among nurses. Implementing mindfulness-based training in healthcare organizations 
      can offer numerous benefits. One such advantage is that it can help nurses in 
      reducing anxiety and enhancing their ability to handle the pressures associated 
      with their profession. STUDY REGISTRATION: PROSPERO Protocol registration ID:

TI  - The Effects of Combined Respiratory-Gated Auricular Vagal Afferent Nerve 
      Stimulation and Mindfulness Meditation for Chronic Low Back Pain: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 1570-1581
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnac025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Respiratory-gated Auricular Vagal Afferent Nerve stimulation (RAVANS) 
      is a safe nonpharmacological approach to managing chronic pain. The purpose of 
      the current study was to examine (1) the feasibility and acceptability of RAVANS, 
      combined with mindful meditation (MM) for chronic low back pain (CLBP), (2) the 
      potential synergy of MM+RAVANS on improving pain, and (3) possible moderators of 
      the influence of MM+RAVANS on pain. DESIGN: Pilot feasibility and acceptability 
      study. SETTING: Pain management center at large academic medical center. 
      SUBJECTS: Nineteen adults with CLBP and previous MM training. METHODS: 
      Participants attended two sessions during which they completed quantitative 
      sensory testing (QST), rated pain severity, and completed a MM+stimulation 
      session. Participants received RAVANS during one visit and sham stimulation 
      during the other, randomized in order. Following intervention, participants 
      repeated QST. RESULTS: MM+RAVANS was well tolerated, acceptable, and feasible to 
      provide relief for CLBP. Both MM+stimulation sessions resulted in improved back 
      pain severity, punctate pain ratings, and pressure pain threshold. Individuals 
      with greater negative affect showed greater back pain improvement from MM+RAVANS 
      while those with greater mindfulness showed greater back pain improvement from 
      MM+sham. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that for CLBP patients with prior MM 
      training, the analgesic effects of MM may have overshadowed effects of RAVANS 
      given the brief single session MM+RAVANS intervention. However, those with 
      greater negative affect may benefit from combined MM+RAVANS.

TI  - Feasibility, Effectiveness, and Mechanisms of a Brief Mindfulness- and 
      Compassion-Based Program to Reduce Stress in University Students: A Pilot 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - The mental health of university students is a public health concern, as 
      psychopathology has significantly risen among this population. Mindfulness-based 
      programs may support their mental health, though more research is needed. We used 
      a two-armed pilot randomized controlled trial to study the feasibility, 
      preliminary effectiveness, and potential mechanisms of a brief 6-week 
      instructor-led mindfulness- and compassion-based program (MCBP for University 
      Life) on perceived stress and psychological distress. Thirty undergraduate 
      psychology students participated (15 in the intervention group, and 15 as 
      wait-list controls). Those in the intervention arm engaged well with the course 
      and formal at-home practice, attending at least five sessions and meditating 
      between 4-6 days per week. Significant improvements in perceived stress, 
      psychological distress, mindfulness skills, decentering, self-compassion, and 
      experiential avoidance were found at the end of the intervention, while the 
      wait-list group remained unchanged. There were significant differences between 
      the two groups in those variables at post-test, favoring the intervention arm 
      with major effects. Reductions in stress were mediated by improvements in 
      mindfulness skills, decentering, and self-compassion; meanwhile reductions in 
      psychological distress were mediated by improvements in decentering. These 
      results suggest that this intervention might be feasible and effective for 
      university students, but more high-quality research is needed.

TI  - Comparison of the Effectiveness of an Abbreviated Program versus a Standard 
      Program in Mindfulness, Self-Compassion and Self-Perceived Empathy in Tutors and 
      Resident Intern Specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing in 
      Spain.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18084340 [doi]

AB  - Health professionals are among the most vulnerable to work stress and emotional 
      exhaustion problems. These health professionals include tutors and resident 
      intern specialists, due to the growing demand for the former and the high work 
      overload of the latter. Mindfulness training programs can support these 
      professionals during times of crisis, such as the current global pandemic caused 
      by the coronavirus-19 disease. The objective of this study was to compare the 
      effectiveness of an abbreviated Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and 
      Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training program in relation to a standard training 
      program on the levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-perceived empathy 
      in tutors and resident intern specialists of Family and Community Medicine and 
      Nursing. A total of 112 professionals attached to six Spanish National Health 
      System teaching units (TUs) participated in this randomized and controlled 
      clinical trial. Experimental Group (GE) participants were included in the 
      standard or abbreviated MBSR programs. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire 
      (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale short form (SCS-SF), and the Jefferson Scale of 
      Physician Empathy (JSPE) were administered three times during the study: before, 
      immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance 
      analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant 
      increase in mindfulness (F((2,91)) = 3.271; p = 0.042; η(2) = 0.067) and 
      self-compassion (F((2,91)) = 6.046; p = 0.003; η(2) = 0.117) in the post-test 
      visit, and in self-compassion (F((2,79)) = 3.880; p = 0.025; η(2) = 0.089) in the 
      follow-up visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training 
      program. The standard MBSR and MSC training program improves levels of 
      mindfulness and self-compassion, and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and 
      resident intern specialists. New studies are needed to demonstrate the 
      effectiveness of abbreviated training programs.

AB  - In addition to its health benefits, mindfulness has been theorized in classical 
      contemplative frameworks to elicit self-transcendent experiences as a means of 
      promoting universal love and compassion. Increasing feelings of love may be 
      especially clinically relevant for the treatment of opioid misuse, in that 
      addictive use of opioids dysregulates neurobiological processes implicated in the 
      experience of love. Here we tested these hypotheses in a secondary analysis 
      (n = 187) of data from a randomized clinical trial of Mindfulness-Oriented 
      Recovery Enhancement (MORE) versus supportive psychotherapy for comorbid opioid 
      misuse and chronic pain. At pre- and post-treatment, participants completed a 
      measure of state self-transcendence immediately following a laboratory-based 
      mindfulness task. Through 9-month follow-up, we assessed changes in universal 
      love and opioid misuse. Participants also completed ecological momentary 
      assessments of opioid craving during the 8-week study interventions and for the 
      following month. Compared to supportive psychotherapy, participants in MORE 
      reported significantly greater increases in mindfulness-induced 
      self-transcendence, which mediated the effect of MORE on increased feelings of 
      universal love. In turn, increases in universal love significantly predicted 
      decreased opioid craving and lower odds opioid misuse through 1- and 9-month 
      follow-ups, respectively. Findings suggest mindfulness-induced self-transcendence 
      may promote feelings of universal love, with possible downstream benefits on 
      reducing addictive behavior.

PG  - 928-942
LID - 10.1177/1087054717727350 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a promising psychosocial 
      intervention for adult ADHD. The feasibility and effectiveness of an adapted MBCT 
      program is explored, together with the possible process of change. Method: 
      Mixed-method study with 31 ADHD patients participating in an adapted MBCT 
      program. Self-report questionnaires on ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, 
      mindfulness skills, self-compassion, patient functioning, and health status were 
      administered before and after MBCT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
      with 24 patients. Results: A modest drop-out of n = 5 (16%) was found. MBCT 
      resulted in a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms and improvements of 
      executive functioning, self-compassion, and mental health. Qualitative analysis 
      provided insight in facilitators and barriers participants experienced, and their 
      process of change. Conclusion: The adapted MBCT program seemed to be feasible for 
      adults with ADHD and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness is shown. An 
      adequately powered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is needed to further examine 
      the effectiveness of MBCT for ADHD.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Mindfulness and Self-Compassion Standard Training Program 
      versus an Abbreviated Training Program on Stress in Tutors and Resident Intern 
      Specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing in Spain.

AB  - Stress is one of the most common problems among healthcare professionals, as they 
      are exposed to potentially stressful and emotionally challenging situations in 
      the workplace. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training programs have 
      been shown to decrease stress. The objective of this study was to compare the 
      effectiveness of an abbreviated 4-weeks MBSR training program in relation to a 
      standard 8-weeks one on the stress levels. A controlled and randomized clinical 
      trial was designed, in which 112 tutors and resident intern specialists in Family 
      and Community Medicine and Nursing of six Spanish National Health System teaching 
      units (TUs) participated. Participants included in the experimental groups (EGs) 
      received a MBRS training program (standard or abbreviated), while control group 
      (CG) participants did not receive any intervention. The stress levels were 
      assessed by the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) in three different moments 
      during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. 
      Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, 
      showed a significant reduction in stress (F((2,91)) = 5.165; p = 0.008; η(2) = 
      0.102) in the post-test visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard 
      training program, but without the maintenance of its effects over time. No 
      significant impact of the abbreviated training program on stress levels was 
      observed in the intergroup comparison. A standard 8-weeks MBSR training program 
      aimed at tutors and resident intern specialists in Family and Community Medicine 
      and Nursing produces significant improvements in stress levels compared with the 
      abbreviated intervention and no intervention. New studies about abbreviated 
      training programs are needed to provide effective treatments which improve 
      well-being of these professionals.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction and attachment-based 
      compassion therapy for the treatment of depressive, anxious, and adjustment 
      disorders in mental health settings: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1138-1151
LID - 10.1002/da.23198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of attachment-based compassion therapy 
      (ABCT) for reducing affective distress in a sample of outpatients with 
      depressive, anxiety, or adjustment disorders, and to explore its mechanisms of 
      action. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial involved the assessment time 
      points of pretreatment, posttreatment and 6-month follow-up. A total of 90 
      patients from three mental health units in Castellón, Spain, were recruited and 
      randomly assigned to "ABCT + treatment as usual (TAU)," "Mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction (MBSR) + TAU" or "TAU" alone. Affective distress, as measured by the 
      "Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales" (DASS-21) was the main outcome; 
      self-compassion and mindfulness were also assessed. Multilevel mixed-effects 
      models were used to estimate the effectiveness of the program, and path analyses 
      were conducted to study the potential mechanistic role of mindfulness and 
      self-compassion. RESULTS: ABCT was not superior to MBSR in any outcome or at any 
      assessment point. ABCT was superior to TAU alone both posttreatment (B = -13.20; 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: -19.57, -6.84) and at 6-month follow-up (B = -7.20; 
      95% CI: -13.63, -0.76) for reducing DASS-21, and MBSR was superior to TAU alone 
      both posttreatment (B = -11.51; 95% CI: -17.97, -5.05) and at 6-month follow-up 
      (B = -8.59; 95% CI: -15.09, -2.10), with large effects (d ≥ 0.90). Changes 
      produced by ABCT in DASS-21 were mediated by self-compassion, whereas changes 
      produced by MBSR were mediated by both mindfulness and self-compassion. 
      CONCLUSION: ABCT is effective for reducing affective distress in patients with 
      anxiety, depressive and adjustment disorders, although its effect is not superior 
      to that offered by MBSR. Self-compassion seems to be a significant mediator of 
      the effects of ABCT.

AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: This study investigated the impact of the Mindful 
      Self-Compassion Program, based on Watson's Theory of Human Caring Model, on the 
      physical and mental health of nursing students. The essence of nursing is care 
      and compassion. While there are studies on compassion in nursing care, nurses' 
      self-compassion is an underrecognized concept in the literature. METHODS: The 
      study employed a randomized controlled design and involved 80 seconds-grade 
      nursing students from a university in Turkey between December 2021 and June 2022. 
      The intervention group received an online program consisting of six weekly 
      sessions, while the control group did not receive any intervention. The data were 
      collected using the Promotive and Protective Health Behaviors Scale, Watson 
      Caritas Self-Rating Score, Brief Resilience Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale 
      before, at the end of, and 5 months after the program. RESULTS: In both the 
      post-test and follow-up test, the intervention group exhibited an increase in 
      health-promoting and protective behaviors, self-care perception, psychological 
      resilience, and self-compassion compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: 
      Therefore, it is recommended to use the program to improve the physical and 
      mental health of individuals in nursing practice areas. Additionally, it would be 
      beneficial to include the program in the nursing education curriculum. Our 
      findings provide evidence supporting the use of the program for nursing students 
      and nurses.

AB  - Meditation-based mental training interventions show physical and mental health 
      benefits. However, it remains unclear how different types of mental practice 
      affect emotion processing at both the neuronal and the behavioural level. In the 
      context of the ReSource project, 332 participants underwent an fMRI scan while 
      performing an emotion anticipation task before and after three 3-month training 
      modules cultivating 1) attention and interoceptive awareness (Presence); 2) 
      socio-affective skills, such as compassion (Affect); 3) socio-cognitive skills, 
      such as theory of mind (Perspective). Only the Affect module led to a significant 
      reduction of experienced negative affect when processing images depicting human 
      suffering. In addition, after the Affect module, participants showed significant 
      increased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus when confronted with 
      negative stimuli. We conclude that socio-affective, but not attention- or 
      meta-cognitive based mental training is specifically effective to improve emotion 
      regulation capabilities when facing adversity.

      time points of baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. A total of 280 
      students from two Spanish universities were randomly assigned to 'MBP', 
      'MBP + VR', or 'Relaxation' (active controls). Perceived stress posttreatment was 
      the primary outcome; wellbeing and academic functional outcomes were assessed as 
      well. Multilevel mixed-effects models were performed to estimate the efficacy of 
      the programme. RESULTS: Both 'MBP' (B = -2.77, d = -0.72, p = .006) and 
      'MBP + VR' (B = -2.44, d = -0.59, p = .014) were superior to 'Relaxation' in 
      improving stress, as well as most of the secondary outcomes, with medium-to-large 
      effects posttreatment and at follow-up. The long-term effects of MBPs on stress 
      were mediated by mindfulness and self-compassion in parallel. Treatment adherence 
      was improved in the 'MBP + VR' group, with higher retention rates and session 
      attendance (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This RCT supports the efficacy of an MBP 
      compared to relaxation for reducing stress in university students through 
      mindfulness and self-compassion as mechanisms of change. VR exposure may enhance 
      treatment adherence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03771300.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention programs that are 'transdiagnostic' may be more 
      cost-effective and beneficial, in terms of reducing levels of psychopathology in 
      the general population, than those focused on a specific disorder. This 
      randomized controlled study evaluated the efficacy of one such intervention 
      program called Resilience Training (RT). METHODS: College students who reported 
      mildly elevated depressive or subclinical psychotic symptoms ('psychotic 
      experiences' (PEs)) (n = 107) were randomized to receiving RT (n = 54) or to a 
      waitlist control condition (n = 53). RT consists of a four-session intervention 
      focused on improving resilience through the acquisition of mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and mentalization skills. Measures of symptoms and these 
      resilience-enhancing skills were collected before and after the 4-week 
      RT/waitlist period, with a follow-up assessment 12-months later. RESULTS: 
      Compared to the waitlist control group, RT participants reported significantly 
      greater reductions in PEs, distress associated with PEs, depression, and anxiety, 
      as well as significantly greater improvements in resilience, mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and positive affect, following the 4-week RT/waitlist period 
      (all p < 0.03). Moreover, improvements in resilience-promoting skills were 
      significantly correlated with symptom reductions (all p < 0.05). Lastly, the 
      RT-related reductions in PEs and associated distress were maintained at the 
      12-month follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: RT is a brief, group-based 
      intervention associated with improved resilience and reduced symptoms of 
      psychopathology, with sustained effects on PEs, in transdiagnostically at-risk 
      young adults. Follow-up studies can further assess the efficacy of RT relative to 
      other interventions and test whether it can reduce the likelihood of developing a 
      serious mental illness.

TI  - When depressed-be mindful of and kind to yourself: Self-compassion as mediator of 
      change in a mindful depression treatment.
PG  - 182-194
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2023.2179439 [doi]
AB  - Self-compassion as an outcome and potential mediator in mindfulness-based 
      interventions has gained increased attention in the last years. However, most 
      mediation studies had several methodological shortcomings which precluded robust 
      conclusions regarding its mediating role. This randomized controlled study aimed 
      to address these issues by assessing self-compassion, as proposed mediator and 
      outcome, in a temporal sequence. Eighty-one patients with current depression and 
      work-related conflicts were randomly assigned to either an eight-week 
      mindfulness-based day hospital treatment (MDT-DH; n = 47; including 
      psychopharmacological treatment if necessary) or a waitlist control condition 
      including a psychopharmacological consultation (PCC; n = 34). The outcome, 
      depression severity, was assessed before, at mid-treatment and after the 
      treatment while the proposed mediator, self-compassion, was measured at two 
      week-intervals from before treatment until directly after treatment. 
      Within-person and between-person mediation effects were analysed using multilevel 
      structural equation modelling. The results from the mediation models show that 
      self-compassion (as a general factor) and two of its components (mindfulness of 
      personal suffering and common humanity) increased and mediated the change in 
      depressive symptoms over time. This study provides preliminary support for 
      self-compassion as a mediator of treatment effects on depression in a mindful 
      depression treatment.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion Training Reduces Stress and Burnout Symptoms Among 
      Practicing Psychologists: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Brief Web-Based 
      Intervention.
PG  - 2340
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02340 [doi]
LID - 2340
AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were (a) to examine the effects of a 6 weeks 
      web-based mindful self-compassion program on stress and burnout symptoms in a 
      group of practicing psychologists, and (b) to examine relationships between 
      changes in self-compassion and self-coldness and changes in stress and burnout 
      symptoms. Method: In a randomized controlled trial, 101 practicing psychologists 
      were assigned to a training group (n = 51) or a wait-list control group (n = 49). 
      The training encompassed 15 min exercises per day, 6 days a week, for 6 weeks. 
      The participants completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), the Five Facets of 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the 
      Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) pre and post intervention. Results: 
      Eighty-one participants (n = 40 in the training group, n = 41 in the control 
      group) took part in the pre and post intervention assessments. Selective gains 
      for the intervention group were observed for SCS total scores (d = 0.86; d = 0.94 
      for the SCS), FFMQ scores (d = 0.60), while levels of self-coldness was reduced 
      (d = 0.73). Critically, levels of perceived stress (d = 0.59) and burnout 
      symptoms (d = 0.44 for SMBQ total) were additionally lowered post intervention. 
      Finally, the results confirmed the hypothesis that the measures of distress would 
      be more strongly related to self-coldness than self-compassion, a pattern seen in 
      cross-sectional analyses and, for burnout, also in the longitudinal analyses. 
      Conclusions: This training program appeared effective to increase 
      self-compassion/reduce self-coldness, and to alleviate stress and symptoms of 
      burnout and provide support of the distinction between self-compassion and 
      self-coldness. Additional studies, preferably three-armed RCTs with long-term 
      follow-up, are warranted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the program.

      function, frontal alpha asymmetry and immune function.
PG  - 34-43
LID - 10.1159/000350949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has enhanced 
      cognition, positive emotion, and immunity in younger and middle-aged samples; its 
      benefits are less well known for older persons. Here we report on a randomized 
      controlled trial of MBSR for older adults and its effects on executive function, 
      left frontal asymmetry of the EEG alpha band, and antibody response. METHODS: 
      Older adults (n = 201) were randomized to MBSR or waiting list control. The 
      outcome measures were: the Trail Making Test part B/A (Trails B/A) ratio, a 
      measure of executive function; changes in left frontal alpha asymmetry, an 
      indicator of positive emotions or approach motivation; depression, mindfulness, 
      and perceived stress scores, and the immunoglobulin G response to a protein 
      antigen, a measure of adaptive immunity. RESULTS: MBSR participants had a lower 
      Trails B/A ratio immediately after intervention (p < 0.05); reduced shift to 
      rightward frontal alpha activation after intervention (p = 0.03); higher baseline 
      antibody levels after intervention (p < 0.01), but lower antibody responses 24 
      weeks after antigen challenge (p < 0.04), and improved mindfulness after 
      intervention (p = 0.023) and at 21 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: 
      MBSR produced small but significant changes in executive function, mindfulness, 
      and sustained left frontal alpha asymmetry. The antibody findings at follow-up 
      were unexpected. Further study of the effects of MBSR on immune function should 
      assess changes in antibody responses in comparison to T-cell-mediated effector 
      functions, which decline as a function of age.

TI  - Testing the Efficacy of 'Unlearning', a Mindfulness and Compassion-Based 
      Programme for Cultivating Nonviolence in Teenagers: A Randomised Controlled 
      Trial.

AB  - Background: Most programmes developed to reduce aggressive attitudes among 
      teenagers are based on cultivating nonviolence, a construct that has been related 
      to compassion and, more indirectly, mindfulness. This study aims at testing the 
      efficacy of 'Unlearning', a mindfulness and compassion-based programme, for 
      reducing aggressive attitudes in adolescents. Method: A sample of 164 students 
      from three high schools in Zaragoza (Spain) participated in the study. They were 
      randomly assigned to (1) 'Unlearning', or (2) relaxation programme. Three 
      assessment points were established: baseline, post-treatment and a 4-month 
      follow-up. The outcome variables were the subscales of the 'Attitudes Toward 
      Social Aggression Scale'. Mindfulness and compassion were assessed as secondary 
      outcomes. Results: 'Unlearning' did not produce changes in the primary outcomes, 
      but significant effects were observed post-treatment in self-compassion; and in 
      the follow-up, in self-compassion and mindfulness. The control group did not 
      experience any change post-treatment, but a significant effect in mindfulness was 
      observed in the follow-up. The intergroup analyses indicated that 'Unlearning' 
      improved self-compassion, both post-treatment (t = -2.48, p = 0.014) and after 
      4-months (t = -2.03, p = 0.044), although these results were not statistically 
      significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: 'Unlearning' 
      did not produce significant reductions in aggressive attitudes compared to the 
      control group. The low baseline levels may have hindered the efficacy of the 
      interventions. 'Unlearning' showed potential to improve self-compassion, which is 
      related to nonviolence, and this may have positive implications for the 
      adolescents. Future interventions should include teachers and families to enhance 
      the effectiveness of the programmes.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of the new short-term online emotion focused training 
      for self-compassion and self-protection in a nonclinical sample.
PG  - 333-343
LID - 10.1007/s12144-018-9933-4 [doi]
AB  - The Emotion Focused Training for Self-Compassion and Self-Protection (EFT-SCP) is 
      an intervention developed to increase skills of self-compassion and protective 
      anger with the aim to decrease self-criticism. This novel intervention was 
      developed on the basis of the latest findings on self-criticism from 
      Emotion-focused therapy and previous programs cultivating compassion (namely 
      Compassion Mind Training and Mindful Self-Compassion Program). According to 
      existing research, simply cultivating self-compassion is not always sufficient in 
      reducing self-criticism. Therefore, the EFT-SCP was designed to build 
      self-compassion whilst developing protective anger to combat self-criticism. Our 
      goal was to investigate the efficacy of this new, short-term, online EFT-SCP 
      program in a non-clinical population. A randomized control trial was conducted 
      with pre- and post-intervention measurements and two-month follow-up of 
      self-compassion and self-criticism/reassurance. Convenience sampling was used to 
      recruit participants through a snowballing technique on social media. A total of 
      123 participants were randomly allocated to the EFT-SCP intervention or to a 
      control condition. The intervention group were instructed through emails to 
      complete an EFT-SCP task every day for 14 consecutive days. The control group did 
      not complete any tasks. Out of 123 participants, 31 from intervention group and 
      20 from control group completed all measurements. There was a significant effect 
      of the EFT-SCP on increasing self-compassion and self-reassurance scores as 
      reported at two-month follow-up. The EFT-SCP was also effective at reducing 
      self-uncompassionate responding and self-criticism (specifically Hated self) with 
      changes evident at two months post-intervention. These findings are encouraging 
      and suggest that interventions designed to enhance self-compassion and decrease 
      self-criticism can be delivered to broader populations without the direct contact 
      with mental health professionals.

AB  - Self-compassion training has been shown to deliver mental health benefits and 
      preliminary evidence suggests it might also be possible to deliver these benefits 
      effectively via virtual reality (VR) technology. However, which features of the 
      VR training environment influence these training benefits remains poorly 
      understood. This study was designed to provide the first empirical test of the 
      potential value of visual biofeedback during self-compassion training. It was 
      theorised that the provision of biofeedback may increase the benefits of training 
      by increasing mindfulness, a core component of self-compassion. Sixty 
      participants were randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions, both 
      of which comprised VR-based self-compassion training, but only one of which 
      included visual biofeedback (a red pulsating light representing heart rate). 
      Relative to scores at baseline, participants reported greater self-compassion, 
      and lower self-criticism, anxiety, and stress after VR self-compassion training. 
      However, the provision of biofeedback did not influence the strength of these 
      training effects. These data provide further evidence that VR administered 
      self-compassion training may deliver potentially important mental health 
      benefits, but also meaningfully extends this literature by proving the first 
      evidence that visual biofeedback does not influence the strength of these 
      benefits.

TI  - Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based 
      intervention versus relaxation to reduce emotional exhaustion in medical students 
      in France: the "Must prevent" study.
PG  - 115

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical students are exposed to an emotionally exhausting 
      training/work environment and to stressful academic demands. Consequently, 
      psychopathologies, burnout and suicidal ideation are frequent in this population. 
      These factors can also affect their empathy and quality of care. Therefore, the 
      development and implementation of programs to promote resilience to stress 
      specifically in medical students and the evaluation of their efficiency are a 
      priority. Here, we describe the protocol of the first French study to assess the 
      long-term effectiveness and acceptability of a mindfulness-based intervention 
      (MBI) compared with relaxation training (RT) to reduce emotional exhaustion in 
      medical students. METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled trial ("Must 
      prevent") plans to enroll 612 students in the fourth and fifth year of medical 
      studies from nine French universities. After inclusion, they will be assigned 
      randomly to the MBI or RT group. Both interventions are structured around an 
      8-week program that includes one group class per week and daily at-home 
      exercises. The primary endpoint is the emotional exhaustion score assessed with 
      the Maslach Burnout Inventory at month 12 of the follow-up. Secondary endpoints 
      include anxiety-depressive symptomatology, suicidality, psychoactive substance 
      use, depersonalization, psychological and physical pain, empathy, emotional 
      regulation, self-compassion, mindfulness, quality of life, and program 
      acceptability. Evaluations will be done before and immediately after the 8-week 
      intervention, and at month 6 and 12 of the post-intervention follow-up. 
      DISCUSSION: If the proposed interventions are well accepted and useful to 
      decrease negative emotions and/or increase wellbeing among medical students, they 
      should be disseminated among this population and even included as part of the 
      training on emotional skills needed for the routine medical practice. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This trial is registered under the number NCT04026594 (July 18, 
      2019).

      Chronic Pain (iACTwithPain): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 630766
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630766 [doi]
LID - 630766
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) has serious medical and social consequences and 
      leads to economic burden that threatens the sustainability of healthcare 
      services. Thus, optimized management of pain tools to support CP patients in 
      adjusting to their condition and improving their quality of life is timely. 
      Although acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is considered an evidence-based 
      psychological approach for CP, evidence for the efficacy of online-delivered ACT 
      for CP is still scarce. At the same time, studies suggest that self-compassion 
      mediates the change in disability and psychopathological symptoms in ACT 
      interventions for CP, although self-compassion is not a specific target in ACT. 
      Thus, an explicit focus on self-compassion might increase the efficacy of ACT 
      interventions for CP, although this hypothesis has not been tested. This study 
      aims to develop an eHealth ACT and compassion-based self-management intervention 
      for CP, the iACTwithPain, and to compare its efficacy in improving health 
      outcomes to a similar ACT-only intervention and a medical TAU group. METHODS: The 
      eHealth platform that will host the interventions will be developed using a flat 
      design identity and will be interactive. The iACTwithPain intervention will 
      comprise eight weekly self-management sessions and will be developed taking into 
      consideration the psychological flexibility model applied to CP, with the 
      addition of explicit compassion-based components. To analyze whether the 
      iACTwithPain intervention will present superiority in improving CP's impact and 
      related health markers over the two other conditions, this study will follow an 
      RCT design with three arms. CP patients will be recruited through direct contact 
      with patient associations and healthcare services and a national press release in 
      Portugal. Outcome measurement will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention 
      and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The interventions' acceptability will also be 
      assessed. DISCUSSION: The iACTwithPain intervention is expected to improve CP 
      patients' psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and empowerment, by 
      promoting adaptive disease management and regulation of pain-related internal 
      experiences. Results will contribute to a better understanding on the pertinence 
      of adding compassion elements to ACT for CP and to reach an optimized 
      intervention for CP. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered 
      at ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT04200183; 16 December 2019; 
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04200183). The current manuscript 
      comprises the first version of this clinical trial's protocol.

TI  - A Short Mindfulness Retreat for Students to Reduce Stress and Promote 
      Self-Compassion: Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial Exploring Both an Indoor and a 
      Natural Outdoor Retreat Setting.

AB  - Here, we developed and examined a new way of disseminating mindfulness in nature 
      to people without meditation experience, based on the finding that mindfulness 
      conducted in natural settings may have added benefits. We evaluated a 5-day 
      residential programme aiming to reduce stress and improve mental health outcomes. 
      We compared an indoor and an outdoor version of the programme to a control group 
      in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Sixty Danish university students 
      experiencing moderate to high levels of stress were randomised into a residential 
      mindfulness programme indoors (n = 20), in nature (n = 22), or a control group (n 
      = 18). Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale and the Self-Compassion 
      Scale (primary outcomes) along with additional secondary outcome measures at the 
      start and end of the program and 3 months after. Stress was decreased with small 
      to medium effect sizes post-intervention, although not statistically significant. 
      Self-compassion increased post-intervention, but effect sizes were small and not 
      significant. At follow-up, changes in stress were not significant, however 
      self-compassion increased for both interventions with medium-sized effects. For 
      the intervention groups, medium- to large-sized positive effects on trait 
      mindfulness after a behavioural task were found post-intervention, and small- to 
      medium-sized effects in self-reported mindfulness were seen at follow-up. 
      Connectedness to Nature was the only outcome measure with an incremental effect 
      in nature, exceeding the control with a medium-sized effect at follow-up. All 
      participants in the nature arm completed the intervention, and so did 97% of the 
      participants in all three arms. Overall, the results encourage the conduct of a 
      larger-scale RCT, but only after adjusting some elements of the programme to 
      better fit and take advantage of the potential benefits of the natural 
      environment.

TI  - The Co-creation and Feasibility of a Compassion Training as a Follow-up to 
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Patients with Recurrent Depression.
PG  - 412-422
LID - 10.1007/s12671-017-0783-1 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and 
      preliminary effectiveness of Mindfulness - Based Compassionate Living (MBCL) as a 
      follow-up intervention to Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy in adults with 
      recurrent depression. We conducted an uncontrolled study in 17 patients with 
      recurrent depression, in two successive groups. The first group contained novices 
      to compassion training (N = 14); in the second group, ten of these participated 
      again, in addition to three new participants (N = 13). The overall group 
      contained 15 females and 2 males, aged between 37 and 71. The MBCL program was 
      qualitatively evaluated using post-intervention focus group interviews in both 
      groups. In addition, self-report questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, 
      worry and both self-compassion and mindfulness skills were administered before 
      and after MBCL. No patients dropped out of the intervention. Average attendance 
      was 7.52 (SD 0.73) out of eight sessions. Helpful elements were theory on the 
      emotion regulation systems, practicing self-compassion explicitly and embodiment 
      of a compassionate attitude by the teachers. Unhelpful elements were the lack of 
      a clear structure, lack of time to practice compassion for self and the 
      occurrence of the so-called back draft effect. We adapted the program in 
      accordance with the feedback of the participants. Preliminary results showed a 
      reduction in depressive symptoms in the second group, but not in the first group, 
      and an increase in self-compassion in both groups. Worry and overall mindfulness 
      did not change. MBCL appears to be feasible and acceptable for patients suffering 
      from recurrent depressive symptoms who previously participated in MBCT. Selection 
      bias may have been a factor as only experienced and motivated participants were 
      used; this, however, suited our intention to co-create MBCL in close 
      collaboration with knowledgeable users. Examination of the effectiveness of MBCL 
      in a sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial is needed.

PG  - 117-31
LID - 10.1002/jclp.20857 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to reduce 
      psychological distress and improve psychological adjustment in medical, 
      psychiatric, and nonclinical samples. We examined its effects on several 
      processes, attitudes, and behavior patterns related to emotion regulation. 
      DESIGN: Fifty-six adults were randomly assigned to MBSR or to a waiting list 
      (WL). RESULTS: Compared with WL completers (n = 21), MBSR completers (n = 20) 
      reported significantly greater increases in trait mindfulness and decreases in 
      absent-mindedness, greater increases in self-compassion, and decreases in fear of 
      emotions, suppression of anger, aggressive anger expression, worry, and 
      difficulties regulating emotions. The WL group subsequently received MBSR, and 
      the two groups combined showed significant changes on all of these variables from 
      pre-MBSR to post-MBSR, and on all except the 2 anger variables from pre-test to 
      2-month follow-up, as well as significant reductions in rumination. CONCLUSION: 
      An 8-week mindfulness training program might increase mindful awareness in daily 
      life and have beneficial impact on clinically relevant emotion regulation 
      processes.

AB  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) involves approximately twenty hours of 
      therapist contact time and is not universally available. MBCT self-help (MBCT-SH) 
      may widen access but little is known about its effectiveness. This paper presents 
      a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of MBCT-SH for students. Eighty students were 
      randomly assigned to an eight-week MBCT-SH condition or a wait-list control. 
      ANOVAs showed significant group by time interactions in favour of MBCT-SH on 
      measures of depression, anxiety, stress, satisfaction with life, mindfulness and 
      self-compassion. Post-intervention between-group effect sizes ranged from Cohen's 
      d = 0.22 to 1.07. Engagement with MBCT-SH was high: participants engaged in 
      mindfulness practice a median of two to three times a week and 85% read at least 
      half the intervention book. Only 5% of participants dropped out. This is the 
      first published RCT of MBCT-SH and benefits were found relative to a control 
      group. MBCT-SH has the potential to be a low-cost, readily available and highly 
      acceptable intervention. Future research should include an active control 
      condition and explore whether findings extend to clinical populations.

TI  - Mediators for the Effect of Compassion Cultivating Training: A Longitudinal Path 
      Analysis in a Randomized Controlled Trial Among Caregivers of People With Mental 
      Illness.

AB  - Background: There is a paucity of research on mediators of change, within 
      compassion training programs. The aim was to investigate the mediators, of an 
      8-week compassion cultivation training (CCT) program, on the effect of 
      psychological distress on caregivers of people with a mental illness. Method: 
      Longitudinal path models in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). One hundred 
      ninety-two participants were assessed for eligibility, and 161 participants were 
      included into the trial and randomized. The main outcome was psychological 
      distress measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale at 6 months. 
      Mediators included self-compassion (SC), mindfulness (FM), emotion regulation 
      (ER), emotion suppression (ES), and cognitive reappraisal (CR). Baseline, post, 
      and 3- and 6-month follow-up measurements were collected. Results: The mediated 
      effects for CCT are as follows: depression at 6 months: SC: -1.81 (95% CI: -3.31 
      to -0.31); FM: -1.98 (95% CI: -3.65 to -0.33); ER: -0.14 (95% CI: -1.31 to 1.02); 
      anxiety at 6 months: SC: -0.71 (95% CI: -1.82 to 0.40); FM: -1.24 (95% CI: -2.39 
      to -0.09); ER: 0.18 (95% CI: -1.04 to 1.40); stress at 6 months: SC: -1.44 (95% 
      CI: -2.84 to -0.05); FM: -2.17 (95% CI: -3.63 to -0.71); ER: -0.27 (95% CI: -1.51 
      to 0.98). Conclusion: Mindfulness and self-compassion are important components in 
      reducing psychological distress experienced by informal caregivers of people with 
      a mental illness. Results contribute to the knowledge about the underlying 
      mechanisms of CCT.

AB  - Two transdiagnostic therapies for treating psychological disorder are 
      Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). These 
      two approaches have yet to be compared and therefore the current study aimed to 
      evaluate the feasibility of a study of group MCT and MBSR in treating anxiety and 
      depression. A feasibility trial with 40 participants (aged 19-56) was conducted. 
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive either eight weeks of group MCT or 
      MBSR. The primary outcome was feasibility which included recruitment rates, 
      retention and treatment acceptability. The primary symptom outcome was the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score, which provided an 
      overall measure of distress. Both treatments were found to be acceptable with low 
      attrition and similar ratings of acceptability. Changes in outcomes were analyzed 
      based on the intention-to-treat principle using mixed effect models. Preliminary 
      analyses revealed that MCT was more effective in treating anxiety and depression 
      in comparison to MBSR, and in reducing both positive and negative metacognitive 
      beliefs. Reliable improvement rates favoured MCT at post-treatment and 6-month 
      follow up. Both treatments appeared to be feasible and acceptable in treating 
      transdiagnostic samples; however, a larger, definitive trial is required. The 
      limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental condition characterized 
      by a range of cognitive and behavioral vulnerabilities, including chronic shame 
      and deficits in social problem solving (SPS) abilities. Little research however, 
      has examined strategies that may alleviate shame and SPS deficits among 
      individuals with BPD traits. Using a laboratory experimental approach, the 
      present study compared the effects of a brief mindfulness versus loving-kindness 
      meditation (LKM) induction on shame and SPS abilities in a sample of adults with 
      high BPD traits. Eighty-eight participants underwent a shame induction procedure 
      involving recall of a negative autobiographical memory. They were then randomly 
      assigned to 10 min of mindful breathing or LKM, or a no-instruction condition. 
      Shame and SPS abilities were assessed via visual analogue scales and the 
      Means-Ends Problem Solving task respectively. Results indicated that there were 
      significant decreases in shame from pre-to post-regulation in the mindfulness 
      group versus the LKM and no-instruction groups. Groups did not differ on changes 
      in SPS abilities from pre-to post-regulation. Overall, the findings support the 
      efficacy of mindfulness as a strategy to regulate shame among individuals with 
      BPD traits, and raises questions with regard to the utility of LKM in modulating 
      shame in the context of high emotional arousal.

TI  - Web-based intervention to improve quality of life in late stage bipolar disorder 
      (ORBIT): randomised controlled trial protocol.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/s12888-018-1805-9 [doi]
LID - 221
AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to 
      establish the effectiveness of a novel online quality of life (QoL) intervention 
      tailored for people with late stage (≥ 10 episodes) bipolar disorder (BD) 
      compared with psychoeducation. Relative to early stage individuals, this late 
      stage group may not benefit as much from existing psychosocial treatments. The 
      intervention is a guided self-help, mindfulness based intervention (MBI) 
      developed in consultation with consumers, designed specifically for web-based 
      delivery, with email coaching support. METHODS/DESIGN: This international RCT 
      will involve a comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two 
      5-week adjunctive online self-management interventions: Mindfulness for Bipolar 
      2.0 and an active control (Psychoeducation for Bipolar). A total of 300 
      participants will be recruited primarily via social media channels. Main 
      inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of BD (confirmed via a phone-administered 
      structured diagnostic interview), no current mood episode, history of 10 or more 
      mood episodes, no current psychotic features or active suicidality, under the 
      care of a medical practitioner. Block randomisation will be used for allocation 
      to the interventions, and participants will retain access to the program for 
      6 months. Evaluations will be conducted at pre- and post- treatment, and at 3- 
      and 6- months follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be the Brief Quality of 
      Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale (Brief QoL.BD), collected immediately 
      post-intervention at 5 weeks (T1). Secondary measures include BD-related symptoms 
      (mania, depression, anxiety, stress), time to first relapse, functioning, sleep 
      quality, social rhythm stability and resource use. Measurements will be collected 
      online and via telephone assessments at baseline (T0), 5 weeks (T1), three months 
      (T2) and six months (T3). Candidate moderators (diagnosis, anxiety or substance 
      comorbidities, demographics and current treatments) will be investigated as will 
      putative therapeutic mechanisms including mindfulness, emotion regulation and 
      self-compassion. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. Acceptability 
      and any unwanted events (including adverse treatment reactions) will be 
      documented and explored. DISCUSSION: This definitive trial will test the 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel QoL focused, mindfulness based, 
      online guided self-help intervention for late stage BD, and investigate its 
      putative mechanisms of therapeutic action. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Stimulating meditation: a pre-registered randomised controlled experiment 
      combining a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, with brief 
      mindfulness training.
PG  - 621-630
LID - 10.1177/0269881121991835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-meditation has a variety of benefits on well-being. 
      However, individuals with primary attentional impairments (e.g. attention deficit 
      disorder) or attentional symptoms secondary to anxiety, depression or addiction, 
      may be less likely to benefit, and require additional mindfulness-augmenting 
      strategies. AIMS: To determine whether a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, 
      modafinil, acutely increases subjective and behavioural indices of mindfulness, 
      and augments brief mindfulness training. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, 2 (drug: placebo, modafinil) × 2 (strategy: mindfulness, 
      relaxation control) experiment was conducted. Seventy-nine meditation-naïve 
      participants were assigned to: placebo-relaxation, placebo-mindfulness, 
      modafinil-relaxation or modafinil-mindfulness. Pre-drug, post-drug and 
      post-strategy state mindfulness, affect and autonomic activity, along with 
      post-strategy sustained attention and mind-wandering were assessed within a 
      single lab session. After the session, participants were instructed to practice 
      their assigned behavioural strategy daily for one week, with no further drug 
      administration, after which, follow-up measures were taken. RESULTS: As 
      predicted, modafinil acutely increased state mindfulness and improved sustained 
      attention. Differential acute strategy effects were found following mindfulness 
      on autonomic activity but not state mindfulness. There were no strategy or drug 
      effects on mind-wandering. However, exploratory analyses indicated that 
      participants receiving modafinil engaged in more strategy practice across 
      strategy conditions during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil acutely mimicked the 
      effects of brief mindfulness training on state mindfulness but did not enhance 
      the effects of this training. Limitations of the current study, and 
      recommendations for future research examining modafinil as an adjunct to 
      mindfulness- (or relaxation-) based treatments are discussed.

AB  - Longitudinal research investigating the enduring impact of mindfulness training 
      is scarce. This study investigates the six-year effects of a seven-week 
      mindfulness-based course, by studying intervention effects in the trajectory of 
      dispositional mindfulness and coping skills, and the association between those 
      change trajectories and subjective well-being at six-year follow-up. 288 
      Norwegian medical and psychology students participated in a randomized controlled 
      trial. 144 received a 15-hour mindfulness course over seven weeks in the second 
      or third semester with booster sessions twice yearly, while the rest continued 
      their normal study curricula. Outcomes were subjective well-being, and 
      dispositional mindfulness and coping assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness 
      Questionnaire and the Ways of Coping Checklist. Analyses were performed for the 
      intention-to-treat sample, using latent growth curve models. At six-year 
      follow-up, students receiving mindfulness training reported increased well-being. 
      Furthermore, they reported greater increases in the trajectory of dispositional 
      mindfulness and problem-focused coping along with greater decreases in the 
      trajectory of avoidance-focused coping. Increases in problem-focused coping 
      predicted increases in well-being. These effects were found despite relatively 
      low levels of adherence to formal mindfulness practice. The findings demonstrate 
      the viability of mindfulness training in the promotion of well-being and adaptive 
      coping, which could contribute to the quality of care given, and to the 
      resilience and persistence of health care professionals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00892138.

TI  - Effect of compassion meditation on neuroendocrine, innate immune and behavioral 
      responses to psychosocial stress.

AB  - Meditation practices may impact physiological pathways that are modulated by 
      stress and relevant to disease. While much attention has been paid to meditation 
      practices that emphasize calming the mind, improving focused attention, or 
      developing mindfulness, less is known about meditation practices that foster 
      compassion. Accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion 
      meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to 
      psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation 
      practice influenced stress reactivity. Sixty-one healthy adults were randomized 
      to 6 weeks of training in compassion meditation (n=33) or participation in a 
      health discussion control group (n=28) followed by exposure to a standardized 
      laboratory stressor (Trier social stress test [TSST]). Physiologic and behavioral 
      responses to the TSST were determined by repeated assessments of plasma 
      concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and cortisol as well as total distress 
      scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS). No main effect of group assignment 
      on TSST responses was found for IL-6, cortisol or POMS scores. However, within 
      the meditation group, increased meditation practice was correlated with decreased 
      TSST-induced IL-6 (r(p)=-0.46, p=0.008) and POMS distress scores (r(p)=-0.43, 
      p=0.014). Moreover, individuals with meditation practice times above the median 
      exhibited lower TSST-induced IL-6 and POMS distress scores compared to 
      individuals below the median, who did not differ from controls. These data 
      suggest that engagement in compassion meditation may reduce stress-induced immune 
      and behavioral responses, although future studies are required to determine 
      whether individuals who engage in compassion meditation techniques are more 
      likely to exhibit reduced stress reactivity.

TI  - A randomized pilot trial of a positive affect skill intervention (lessons in 
      linking affect and coping) for women with metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 2101-2108
LID - 10.1002/pon.4312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized pilot trial to examine the feasibility, 
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 5 week positive affect skills 
      intervention (LILAC: lessons in linking affect and coping) for women with 
      metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, we examined whether online delivery of 
      the intervention would offer comparable benefits as in-person delivery. METHODS: 
      Women with metastatic breast cancer (N = 39) were randomized to an in-person 
      intervention, online intervention, or in-person attention-matched control. 
      Psychological well-being (depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
      Scale], positive and negative affect [Differential Emotions Scale], 
      cancer-specific quality of life [Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale-Cancer 
      Version]), and positive coping (mindfulness, positive-affect skill use, and 
      self-compassion [Self-Compassion Scale: Short-Form]) were assessed at baseline, 
      1 week post-intervention, and 1 month post-intervention follow-up. RESULTS: The 
      LILAC intervention showed good feasibility, acceptability, and retention. 
      Although the study was not adequately powered to detect between-group differences 
      in change on preliminary efficacy outcomes, within-group comparisons revealed 
      that LILAC participants (in-person and online combined) showed reductions in 
      depression and negative affect by the 1 month follow-up (d = -0.81). Notably, 
      LILAC participants fell below the clinical threshold for depression (Center for 
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale = 16) by the 1 month follow-up 
      (t[17] = -2.22, P = .04, d = -0.52), whereas control participants did not differ 
      from threshold (t[9] = 0.45, P = .66, d = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: The LILAC 
      intervention, regardless of delivery method, shows feasibility, acceptability, 
      and preliminary efficacy for promoting psychological well-being in women with 
      metastatic breast cancer. This research provides support for a larger randomized 
      trial to test more definitively the potential benefits of LILAC. A strength of 
      the LILAC intervention includes its innovative focus on positive affect. The 
      efficacy of the online delivery suggests the potential for widespread Internet 
      dissemination.

TI  - Manual Development and Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial of Mindfulness-Based 
      Cognitive Therapy Versus Usual Care for Parents with a History of Depression.
PG  - 1024-1033
AB  - Parental depression can adversely affect parenting and children's development. We 
      adapted mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for parents (MBCT-P) with a 
      history of depression and describe its development, feasibility, acceptability 
      and preliminary estimates of efficacy. Manual development involved interviews 
      with 12 parents who participated in MBCT groups or pilot MBCT-P groups. We 
      subsequently randomised 38 parents of children aged between 2 and 6 years to 
      MBCT-P plus usual care (n = 19) or usual care (n = 19). Parents were interviewed 
      to assess the acceptability of MBCT-P. Preliminary estimates of efficacy in 
      relation to parental depression and children's behaviour were calculated at 4 and 
      9 months post-randomisation. Levels of parental stress, mindfulness and 
      self-compassion were measured. Interviews confirmed the acceptability of MBCT-P; 
      78 % attended at least half the sessions. In the pilot randomised controlled 
      trial (RCT), at 9 months, depressive symptoms in the MBCT-P arm were lower than 
      in the usual care arm (adjusted mean difference = -7.0; 95 % confidence interval 
      (CI) = -12.8 to -1.1; p = 0.02) and 11 participants (58 %) in the MBCT-P arm 
      remained well compared to 6 (32 %) in the usual care arm (mean difference = 26 %; 
      95 % CI = -4 to 57 %; p = 0.02). Levels of mindfulness (p = 0.01) and 
      self-compassion (p = 0.005) were higher in the MBCT-P arm, with no significant 
      differences in parental stress (p = 0.2) or children's behaviour (p = 0.2). 
      Children's behaviour problems were significantly lower in the MBCT-P arm at 
      4 months (p = 0.03). This study suggests MBCT-P is acceptable and feasible. A 
      definitive trial is needed to test its efficacy and cost effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data regarding effects of guided meditation 
      (Yoganidra) on quality of life among patients of chronic kidney disease on 
      maintenance hemodialysis. Our objective was to study effects of guided meditation 
      on physical, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of well-being and quality of 
      life in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. METHOD: We collected 
      baseline and post intervention data in control and intervention groups on 
      hemodialysis and studied the effect of Guided mediation provided for 6 weeks. 
      RESULT: Eighty patients (forty in control and intervention group each) were 
      studied. Mean age was 51 years. Hypertension and Diabetes were the most common 
      etiological condition (28.75%) followed by undermined aetiology (25.00%). 8.75% 
      of the patients had dialysis vintage of less than 1 year. There was statistically 
      significant difference in qualities of happiness and all measures of physical 
      general wellbeing. There was statistically significant difference in burden and 
      effect of kidney disease as well as symptoms of kidney disease post intervention 
      in Kidney Disease Quality of Life score. We carried out Qualitative analysis in 
      our study by maintaining a diary of their subjective experiences related to 
      listening music/guided meditation during the study period in which the feeling of 
      peace and feeling inspired to manage the illness/ do regular work were the most 
      common experiences (97.5%) reported by participants.  CONCLUSION: Guided 
      meditation resulted in statistically significant improvement in happiness, 
      enthusiasm, inspiration, activeness, alertness, awareness, degree of stability, 
      self-confidence, clarity of thoughts, control over anger, self-reflection 
      intervention in the intervention group. It reduced perceived stress. It improved 
      burden and effect of kidney disease, symptoms of kidney disease and total Kidney 
      Disease Quality of Life score. In qualitative dimensions of wellbeing (as 
      emerging from analysis of results of diary), feeling of peace and feeling 
      inspired to manage the illness/ continue regular work, clarity of thoughts, 
      happiness, concentration, reduction of laziness, improved sleep pattern, 
      reduction in anger among other psychological components. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This 
      trial has been registered under clinical trial registry of India. (CTRI 
      number-CTRI/2020/02/023438) (Date: 19/02/2020).

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high need for evidence-based psychosocial treatments for 
      adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to offer alongside 
      treatment as usual (TAU). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a 
      promising psychosocial treatment. This trial investigated the efficacy of MBCT + 
      TAU v. TAU in reducing core symptoms in adults with ADHD. METHODS: A multicentre, 
      single-blind, randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02463396). 
      Participants were randomly assigned to MBCT + TAU (n = 60), an 8-weekly group 
      therapy including meditation exercises, psychoeducation and group discussions, or 
      TAU only (n = 60), which reflected usual treatment in the Netherlands and 
      included pharmacotherapy and/or psychoeducation. Primary outcome was ADHD 
      symptoms rated by blinded clinicians. Secondary outcomes included self-reported 
      ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, 
      positive mental health and general functioning. Outcomes were assessed at 
      baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Post-treatment effects at 
      group and individual level, and follow-up effects were examined. RESULTS: In MBCT 
      + TAU patients, a significant reduction of clinician-rated ADHD symptoms was 
      found at post-treatment [M difference = -3.44 (-5.75, -1.11), p = 0.004, d = 
      0.41]. This effect was maintained until 6-month follow-up. More MBCT + TAU (27%) 
      than TAU participants (4%) showed a ⩾30% reduction of ADHD symptoms (p = 0.001). 
      MBCT + TAU patients compared with TAU patients also reported significant 
      improvements in ADHD symptoms, mindfulness skills, self-compassion and positive 
      mental health at post-treatment, which were maintained until 6-month follow-up. 
      Although patients in MBCT + TAU compared with TAU reported no improvement in 
      executive functioning at post-treatment, they did report improvement at 6-month 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT might be a valuable treatment option alongside TAU 
      for adult ADHD aimed at alleviating symptoms.

AB  - Anxiety, depression and eating disorders show peak emergence during adolescence 
      and share common risk factors. School-based prevention programs provide a unique 
      opportunity to access a broad spectrum of the population during a key 
      developmental window, but to date, no program targets all three conditions 
      concurrently. Mindfulness has shown promising early results across each of these 
      psychopathologies in a small number of controlled trials in schools, and 
      therefore this study investigated its use in a randomised controlled design 
      targeting anxiety, depression and eating disorder risk factors together for the 
      first time. Students (M age 13.63; SD = .43) from a broad band of socioeconomic 
      demographics received the eight lesson, once weekly.b ("Dot be") mindfulness in 
      schools curriculum (N = 132) or normal lessons (N = 176). Anxiety, depression, 
      weight/shape concerns and wellbeing were the primary outcome factors. Although 
      acceptability measures were high, no significant improvements were found on any 
      outcome at post-intervention or 3-month follow-up. Adjusted mean differences 
      between groups at post-intervention were .03 (95% CI: -.06 to -.11) for 
      depression, .01 (-.07 to -.09) for anxiety, .02 (-.05 to -.08) for weight/shape 
      concerns, and .06 (-.08 to -.21) for wellbeing. Anxiety was higher in the 
      mindfulness than the control group at follow-up for males, and those of both 
      genders with low baseline levels of weight/shape concerns or depression. Factors 
      that may be important to address for effective dissemination of mindfulness-based 
      interventions in schools are discussed. Further research is required to identify 
      active ingredients and optimal dose in mindfulness-based interventions in school 
      settings.

TI  - Effectiveness of a mindfulness intervention for older adults to improve emotional 
      well-being and cognitive function in a Chinese population: A randomized 
      waitlist-controlled trial.
LID - 10.1002/gps.5616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of a modified mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction (mMBSR) program on mental well-being and cognitive function of older 
      adults. METHOD: Two hundred and fourty-six participants were randomly assigned to 
      mMBSR (n = 120) group or waitlist control group which received mMBSR at 2-month 
      (n = 123). Data collected at baseline, 2 and 4 months after recruitment. PRIMARY 
      OUTCOME: mental well-being: Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale 
      (SWEMWBS). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form, 
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), international 
      shopping list test, self-compassion scale, peace of mind scale, geriatric 
      depression scale (GDS), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). In 
      modified-intention-to-treat analysis, paired t-test for within group comparison, 
      and ANCOVA to compare group differences at 2-months with adjustment of baseline 
      values. RESULTS: Most participants were female (83.7%), living with others 
      (67.0%), and married (50.7%). No significant difference of baseline 
      characteristics except sleep quality. At 2 months, intervention group reported 
      better mental well-being (0.9, 95%CI: 0.1-1.8, p = 0.025) and less depressive 
      symptoms (-1.0; 95%CI: -1.7 to -0.3, p = 0.004). Within group at 2 months, 
      intervention group had improvement in: mental well-being (SWEMWBS: 22.5-23.4, 
      p = 0.011), cognitive function (MOCA: 24.6-25.8, p < 0.001; VFT: 38.7-42.1, 
      p < 0.001), depressive symptoms (GDS: 4.1-3.1, p < 0.001), and sleep quality 
      (PSQI: 8.3-6.7, p < 0.001). All these changes, except mental well-being, were 
      sustained at 4 months. DISCUSSION: Attrition rate was 14% and mindfulness 
      intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable in older adults. Major 
      limitation of the study was the absence of an active control group to control for 
      non-specific effect.

AB  - This study evaluated two community based interventions for parents of adults with 
      autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities. Parents in the 
      mindfulness group reported significant reductions in psychological distress, 
      while parents in the support and information group did not. Reduced levels of 
      distress in the mindfulness group were maintained at 20 weeks follow-up. 
      Mindfulness scores and mindful parenting scores and related constructs (e.g., 
      self-compassion) did not differ between the two groups. Results suggest the 
      psychological components of the mindfulness based group intervention were 
      effective over and above the non-specific effects of group processes and informal 
      support.

TI  - Effects of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention versus Health Self-Management on 
      Subclinical Anxiety in Older Adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline: The 
      SCD-Well Randomized Superiority Trial.
PG  - 341-350
LID - 10.1159/000515669 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have a 
      heightened risk of developing dementia and frequently experience subclinical 
      anxiety, which is itself associated with dementia risk. OBJECTIVE: To understand 
      whether subclinical anxiety symptoms in SCD can be reduced through behavioral 
      interventions. METHODS: SCD-Well is a randomized controlled trial designed to 
      determine whether an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention (caring 
      mindfulness-based approach for seniors; CMBAS) is superior to a structurally 
      matched health self-management program (HSMP) in reducing subclinical anxiety. 
      Participants were recruited from memory clinics at 4 European sites. The primary 
      outcome was change in anxiety symptoms (trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety 
      Inventory; trait-STAI) from pre- to postintervention. Secondary outcomes included 
      a change in state anxiety and depression symptoms postintervention and 6 months 
      postrandomization (follow-up). RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven participants 
      (mean [SD] age: 72.7 [6.9] years; 64.6% women; CMBAS, n = 73; HSMP, n = 74) were 
      included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was no difference in 
      trait-STAI between groups postintervention (adjusted change difference: -1.25 
      points; 95% CI -4.76 to 2.25) or at follow-up (adjusted change difference: -0.43 
      points; 95% CI -2.92 to 2.07). Trait-STAI decreased postintervention in both 
      groups (CMBAS: -3.43 points; 95% CI -5.27 to -1.59; HSMP: -2.29 points; 95% CI 
      -4.14 to -0.44) and reductions were maintained at follow-up. No between-group 
      differences were observed for change in state anxiety or depression symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A time-limited mindfulness intervention is not superior to health 
      self-management in reducing subclinical anxiety symptoms in SCD. The sustained 
      reduction observed across both groups suggests that subclinical anxiety symptoms 
      in SCD are modifiable. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03005652.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of aromatherapy with lavender and 
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) on female sexual 
      function. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Health centers in Roudan 
      city, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty married women, ages 18 to 45 years, were 
      recruited using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Participants were 
      selected from health centers in 2022 via convenience sampling. INTERVENTION AND 
      MEASUREMENTS: Upon their completion of a demographic checklist and the FSFI as a 
      pretest, participants were divided into three groups, including lavender 
      aromatherapy (n = 20), MBCT-S (n = 20), and control (n = 20) through random 
      selection with permutation blocks. All groups completed FSFI as a posttest. Data 
      were analyzed by SPSS 26 using chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, and 
      Mann-Whitney statistical tests. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant 
      difference among the three groups before the intervention (p = .652), but there 
      was a significant difference among them after the intervention (p = .001). There 
      was a significantly positive difference between the intervention groups and the 
      control group (p < .001). A significant relationship was observed among the three 
      groups in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, lubrication, and arousal. The mean 
      scores of the posttest in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, and lubrication were 
      positively higher in the MBCT-S group than in the aromatherapy group, and both 
      intervention groups showed the same effect for sexual arousal. Aromatherapy and 
      counseling had no significant effect on improving sexual orgasm. CONCLUSION: 
      MBCT-S can be used to improve many aspects of female sexual function, except for 
      orgasm disorders; aromatherapy may improve sexual arousal.

TI  - Does a modified mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) course have the 
      potential to reduce stress and burnout in NHS GPs? Feasibility study.
PG  - 591-597
LID - 10.1017/S1463423618000129 [doi]
AB  - AimTo explore, for the first time, whether a modified mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (MBCT) course has the potential to reduce stress and burnout among 
      National Health Service (NHS) General Practitioners. BACKGROUND: There is a 
      crisis of low morale among NHS GPs, with most describing their workload as 
      'unmanageable'. MBCT has been demonstrated to improve stress and burnout in other 
      populations, but has not yet been evaluated in a cohort of NHS GPs. METHODS: NHS 
      GPs in South East England (n=22) attended a modified version of the MBCT course 
      approved by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for prevention of 
      depressive relapse. This comprised eight weekly 2-h sessions with homework 
      (mindfulness practice) between sessions. Participants completed the Maslach 
      Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) before (baseline) and 
      then again one month (T2) and three months (T3) after attending the course. We 
      also obtained qualitative data on participants' experiences of the 
      course.FindingsCompliance with the intervention was very high. All GPs attended 
      at least six sessions and all completed baseline questionnaires. At T2, data were 
      obtained from 21 participants (95%); PSS scores were significantly lower than at 
      baseline (P&lt;0.001), as were MBI emotional exhaustion (P&lt;0.001) and 
      depersonalization scores (P=0.0421). At T3 we obtained data for 13 participants 
      (59%); PSS scores and MBI emotional exhaustion scores were significantly lower 
      (P&lt;0.001; P=0.0024, respectively) and personal accomplishment scores were 
      significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) than at baseline. Participants reported that 
      the course helped them to manage work pressures, feel more relaxed, enjoy their 
      work and experience greater empathy and compassion (for self, colleagues and 
      patients). Findings of this preliminary evaluation are promising. Further 
      research is needed to evaluate this approach within a larger 
      randomized-controlled trial.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on medical and premedical students.
PG  - 581-99
AB  - The inability to cope successfully with the enormous stress of medical education 
      may lead to a cascade of consequences at both a personal and professional level. 
      The present study examined the short-term effects of an 8-week meditation-based 
      stress reduction intervention on premedical and medical students using a 
      well-controlled statistical design. Findings indicate that participation in the 
      intervention can effectively (1) reduce self-reported state and trait anxiety, 
      (2) reduce reports of overall psychological distress including depression, (3) 
      increase scores on overall empathy levels, and (4) increase scores on a measure 
      of spiritual experiences assessed at termination of intervention. These results 
      (5) replicated in the wait-list control group, (6) held across different 
      experiments, and (7) were observed during the exam period. Future research should 
      address potential long-term effects of mindfulness training for medical and 
      premedical students.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Latino immigrants experience acculturative stress and increased 
      depression risk. Mindfulness meditation improves depressive symptoms, yet the 
      vast majority of research has focused on English speaking populations. METHODS: 
      In this randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel treatment groups, adults with 
      moderate levels of perceived stress (n = 76) were recruited from the Los Angeles 
      community from October 2015 to March 2016, stratified into Spanish- (n = 36) and 
      English speaking (n = 40) language groups, and randomized for 6 weeks of 
      treatment with standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) or health 
      education (HE). Main outcome measure was depressive symptoms, measured by the 
      Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Using an intent-to-treat analysis, the 
      primary outcome, depressive symptoms as indexed by the Beck Depression Inventory, 
      showed greater improvement in MAPs vs. HE, with a between-group post-intervention 
      mean difference of -2.2 (95% CI -4.4 - -0.07) and effect size of 0.28; similar 
      effect sizes were found in the the Spanish- (0.29) and English speaking (0.30) 
      groups. MAPs showed significant improvement relative to HE on secondary outcome 
      of mindfulness with between group difference of 10.7 (95% CI4.5-16.9), but not 
      perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The comparable efficacy of Spanish and English 
      formats of mindfulness meditation in improving depressive symptoms suggests that 
      this community based intervention may mitigate depression risk in Latino adults 
      who are experiencing social adversity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      NCT03545074.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unintentional falls affect 30% of people over age 65 years. Yoga has 
      been shown to improve balance. We designed this study to examine if yoga reduces 
      falls. METHODS: We conducted 16 sessions of Hatha yoga over 8 weeks. Participants 
      were randomly assigned to practice 10min of yoga daily at home in addition to 
      5-min relaxation exercises or relaxation exercises only (control group). RESULTS: 
      Of the 38 participants completing the intervention, 15 participants reported a 
      total of 27 falls in the 6-months before the study, compared to 13 participants 
      sustaining 14 falls in the 6 months from the start of the study (p<0.047), 
      without difference between yoga home-exercise and home relaxation-only groups. 
      Compared to baseline scores, all participants improved on the Berg Balance Scale 
      (53-54 out of 56, p=0.002), the Functional Gait Assessment (22.9-25.8 out of 30 
      points, p<0.001), and the Dynamic Gait Index (20.6-22.4 out of 24 points, 
      p<0.001). Right leg stand time improved from a mean of 13.3s to 17.1s (p=0.020) 
      and standing forward reach distance from 26.0cm to 29.6cm (p<0.001). Without 
      difference between groups. Confidence, with the Activities-specific Balance 
      Confidence Scale, increased in the yoga home-exercise group (88%-93%, p=0.037) 
      compared to 90% unchanged from pre-intervention in the home relaxation-only 
      group. CONCLUSION: Yoga classes reduce self-reported falls and improve balance 
      measures. The addition of home yoga exercises did not enhance benefit over 
      relaxation exercise only.

TI  - A mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students (MediMind): 
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 40

LID - 40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical training is very demanding and associated with a high 
      prevalence of psychological distress. Compared to the general population, medical 
      students are at a greater risk of developing a psychological disorder. Various 
      attempts of stress management training in medical school have achieved positive 
      results on minimizing psychological distress; however, there are often 
      limitations. Therefore, the use of a rigorous scientific method is needed. The 
      present study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial to examine the 
      effectiveness of a specifically developed mindfulness-based stress prevention 
      training for medical students that includes selected elements of cognitive 
      behavioral strategies (MediMind). METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol presents a 
      prospective randomized controlled trial, involving four assessment time points: 
      baseline, post-intervention, one-year follow-up and five-year follow-up. The aims 
      include evaluating the effect on stress, coping, psychological morbidity and 
      personality traits with validated measures. Participants are allocated randomly 
      to one of three conditions: MediMind, Autogenic Training or control group. 
      Eligible participants are medical or dental students in the second or eighth 
      semester of a German university. They form a population of approximately 420 
      students in each academic term. A final total sample size of 126 (at five-year 
      follow-up) is targeted. The trainings (MediMind and Autogenic Training) comprise 
      five weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes each. MediMind will be offered to 
      participants of the control group once the five-year follow-up is completed. The 
      allotment is randomized with a stratified allocation ratio by course of studies, 
      semester, and gender. After descriptive statistics have been evaluated, 
      inferential statistical analysis will be carried out with a repeated measures 
      ANOVA-design with interactions between time and group. Effect sizes will be 
      calculated using partial η-square values. DISCUSSION: Potential limitations of 
      this study are voluntary participation and the risk of attrition, especially 
      concerning participants that are allocated to the control group. Strengths are 
      the study design, namely random allocation, follow-up assessment, the use of 
      control groups and inclusion of participants at different stages of medical 
      training with the possibility of differential analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This 
      trial is recorded at German Clinical Trials Register under the number 
      DRKS00005354 (08 November 2013).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to intensively evaluate the effectiveness of 
      mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on mental illness risks (including 
      psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress) and job strain 
      (job control and job demands) for employees with poor mental health. METHODS: A 
      longitudinal research design was adopted. In total, 144 participants were 
      randomized to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group 
      participated in MBI for eight weeks. Measurements were collected for both groups 
      at five time points: at pre-intervention (T1), at mid-intervention (T2), at the 
      completion of intervention (T3), four weeks after intervention (T4), and eight 
      weeks after intervention (T5). Data were analyzed according to the 
      intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed model with two levels was employed 
      to analyze the repeated measurement data. RESULTS: Compared with the control 
      group, the intercepts (means at T3) for the intervention group were significantly 
      lower on psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress when MBI 
      was completed. Even with the demographic variables controlled, the positive 
      effects remained. For growth rates of prolonged fatigue and perceived stress, 
      participants in the intervention group showed a steeper decrease than did the 
      participants in the control group. Regarding job strain, although the intercept 
      (mean at T3) of job demands showed a significant decline when BMI was completed, 
      the significance disappeared when the demographic variables were controlled. 
      Moreover, the other results for job control and job demands did not show 
      promising findings. CONCLUSION: As a workplace health promotion program, the MBI 
      seems to have potential in improving mental illness risks for employees with poor 
      mental health. However, there was insufficient evidence to support its effect on 
      mitigating job strain. Further research on maintaining the positive effects on 
      mental health for the long term and on developing innovative MBI to suit job 
      strain are recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02241070.

TI  - Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness 
      training to reduce burnout and promote quality of life in police officers: the 
      POLICE study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Police officers experience a high degree of chronic stress. Policing 
      ranks among the highest professions in terms of disease and accident rates. 
      Mental health is particularly impacted, evidenced by elevated rates of burnout, 
      anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life than the general public. 
      Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, burnout and 
      promote quality of life in a variety of settings, although its efficacy in this 
      context has yet to be systematically evaluated. Therefore, this trial will 
      investigate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention versus a waitlist 
      control in improving quality of life and reducing negative mental health symptoms 
      in police officers. METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled trial has 
      three assessment points: baseline, post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. 
      Active police officers (n = 160) will be randomized to Mindfulness-Based Health 
      Promotion (MBHP) or waitlist control group at two Brazilian major cities: Porto 
      Alegre and São Paulo. The primary outcomes are burnout symptoms and quality of 
      life. Consistent with the MBHP conceptual model, assessed secondary outcomes 
      include perceived stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and the potential 
      mechanisms of resilience, mindfulness, decentering, self-compassion, 
      spirituality, and religiosity. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will inform 
      and guide future research, practice, and policy regarding police offer health and 
      quality of life in Brazil and globally. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - Yoga has begun to be incorporated into the treatment of eating disorders despite 
      limited empirical support for this practice. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the efficacy of incorporating Yoga into the treatment of eating 
      disorders. This preliminary randomized controlled trial investigated the benefits 
      of participating in an eight-week Kripalu Yoga program for 53 women with symptoms 
      of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Compared to waitlist controls, Yoga 
      participants experienced decreases in binge eating frequency, emotional 
      regulation difficulties and self-criticism, and increases in self-compassion. 
      Yoga participants also experienced increases in state mindfulness skills across 
      the eight weeks of the Yoga program. While these results are encouraging and 
      suggest Yoga may have a valuable role to play in the treatment of eating 
      disorders, it is important to stress their tentative nature. Further research, 
      adopting a more rigorous design, is needed to address the limitations of the 
      present study and expand on these findings.

TI  - Mindfulness Training Enhances Self-Regulation and Facilitates Health Behavior 
      Change for Primary Care Patients: a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 293-302
LID - 10.1007/s11606-018-4739-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management of health is important for improving health outcomes 
      among primary care patients with chronic disease. Anxiety and depressive 
      disorders are common and interfere with self-regulation, which is required for 
      disease self-management. An insurance-reimbursable mindfulness intervention 
      integrated within primary care may be effective for enhancing chronic disease 
      self-management behaviors among primary care patients with anxiety, depression, 
      trauma, and stress-related and adjustment disorders compared with the 
      increasingly standard practice of referring patients to outside mindfulness 
      resources. OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC) is an 8-week, 
      referral-based, insurance-reimbursable program integrated into safety-net health 
      system patient-centered medical homes. We hypothesized that MTPC would be more 
      effective for catalyzing chronic disease self-management action plan initiation 
      within 2 weeks, versus a low-dose comparator (LDC) consisting of a 60-min 
      mindfulness introduction, referral to community and digital resources, and 
      addition to a 6-month waitlist for MTPC. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care providers 
      (PCPs) and mental health clinicians referred 465 patients over 12 months. All 
      participants had a DSM-V diagnosis. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: Participants 
      (N = 136) were randomized in a 2:1 allocation to MTPC (n = 92) or LDC (n = 44) in 
      a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial. MTPC incorporates 
      mindfulness, self-compassion, and mindfulness-oriented behavior change skills and 
      is delivered as insurance-reimbursable visits within primary care. Participants 
      took part in a chronic disease self-management action planning protocol at week 
      7. MAIN MEASURES: Level of self-reported action plan initiation on the action 
      plan initiation survey by week 9. KEY RESULTS: Participants randomized to MTPC, 
      relative to LDC, had significantly higher adjusted odds of self-management action 
      plan initiation in an intention-to-treat analysis (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.02 to 
      5.06, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week dose of mindfulness training is more 
      effective than a low-dose mindfulness comparator in facilitating chronic disease 
      self-management behavior change among primary care patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite multiple pharmacological interventions, many people with 
      bipolar disorder (BD) experience substantial residual mood symptoms, even in the 
      absence of severe mood episodes, which have a negative impact on the course of 
      illness and quality of life. Limited data are available on how to optimize 
      treatment for BD, especially for those who suffer from persistent and residual 
      depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
      Therapy (MBCT) as a psychological treatment option for BD. This study aims to 
      investigate whether adding MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) will result in 
      symptomatic and functional improvements in adults with BD compared to TAU alone. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, evaluator blinded, multicenter, 
      randomized controlled trial of MBCT + TAU and TAU alone in 160 adults with 
      bipolar type I and type II. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), 
      mid-treatment (Tmid), and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), 12 (T4), and 15 (T5) months 
      follow-up. Primary outcome is post-treatment severity of depressive symptoms 
      (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician administered). Secondary 
      outcomes are severity of (hypo) manic symptoms, anxiety, relapse rates, overall 
      functioning, positive mental health, and cost-effectiveness. As possible 
      mediators will be assessed rumination of negative affect, dampening and 
      rumination of positive affect, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. 
      DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable insight into the 
      (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT on clinician- and self-rated symptoms of BD, relapse 
      rates, positive mental health, and overall functioning. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      NCT03507647 . Registered 25th of April 2018.

AB  - The Four Immeasurables Meditations (FIM) intervention have been shown as a 
      promising intervention for reducing depressive symptoms. The current study is a 
      systematic review of FIM intervention effects on depressive symptoms. Among 192 
      empirical research articles on FIM published before May 2019, 40 independent 
      trials from 35 records measured depressive symptoms. The meta-analysis included 
      21 randomized controlled trials (RCT; n = 1468) and 16 uncontrolled trials 
      (n = 376). The results supported overall effectiveness of FIM on depressive 
      symptoms (d = 0.38 for RCT and d = 0.87 for uncontrolled trials). Moderator 
      analysis indicated the effects differed across protocols, and effects were 
      smaller in RCT using active control groups. No significant differences were 
      observed for participant type, measures, intervention length, or intervention 
      components. Individual studies found no direct association between meditation 
      practice time and effects, and mindfulness and self-compassion were widely 
      supported as mechanisms of change. Current evidence supports FIM as an effective 
      intervention for reducing depressive symptoms, but additional studies with more 
      rigorous designs using active control groups are needed. Further investigation 
      should be encouraged regarding specific protocols and participants, the 
      contribution of meditation practice, and other mechanisms such as positive 
      emotions.

TI  - Perinatal Women's Perspectives of, and Engagement in, Digital Emotional 
      Well-Being Training: Mixed Methods Study.
PG  - e46852

LID - e46852
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress in the early postpartum period can have 
      long-lasting deleterious effects on a mother's well-being and negatively affect 
      her infant's development. Intervention approaches based in contemplative 
      practices such as mindfulness and loving-kindness and compassion are intended to 
      alleviate distress and cultivate well-being and can be delivered effectively as 
      digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). OBJECTIVE: To understand the 
      feasibility of engaging perinatal women in digital interventions, this study 
      aimed to document participants' experiences in the Mums Minds Matter (MMM) study, 
      a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing mindfulness, loving-kindness and 
      compassion, and progressive muscle relaxation training delivered in a digital 
      format and undertaken during pregnancy. To assess the different stages of 
      engagement during and after the intervention, we adapted the connect, attend, 
      participate, enact (CAPE) framework that is based on the idea that individuals go 
      through different stages of engagement before they are able to enact change. 
      METHODS: The MMM study was nested within a longitudinal birth cohort, The ORIGINS 
      Project. We aimed to recruit 25 participants per randomization arm. Data were 
      collected sequentially during the intervention through regular web-based surveys 
      over 8 weeks, with opportunities to provide regular feedback. In the 
      postintervention phase, qualitative data were collected through purposive 
      sampling. RESULTS: Of 310 eligible women, 84 (27.1% [connect rate]) enrolled to 
      participate in MMM. Of the remaining 226 women who did not proceed to 
      randomization, 223 (98.7%) failed to complete the baseline surveys and timed out 
      of eligibility (after 30 weeks' gestation), and 3 (1.3%) displayed high 
      psychological distress scores. Across all program groups, 17 (20% [attend rate]) 
      of the 84 participants actively opted out, although more may have disengaged from 
      the intervention but did not withdraw. The main reasons for withdrawal were busy 
      life and other priorities. In this study, we assessed active engagement and 
      ongoing skills use (participate and enact) through postintervention interviews. 
      We undertook 15 participant interviews, conducted 1 month to 3 months after the 
      intervention. Our results provide insights into participant barriers and enablers 
      as well as app changes, such as the ability to choose topics, daily reminders, 
      case studies, and diversity in sounds. Implementing a DMHI that is brief, 
      includes frequent prompts or nudges, and is easily accessible is a key strategy 
      to target perinatal women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research will enable future app 
      designs that are sufficiently nuanced to maximize the uptake, engagement, and 
      application of mental health skills and contemplative practices in the perinatal 
      period. Providing convenient access to engaging and effective prevention programs 
      is critical and should be part of prenatal self-care. Our research underscores 
      the appeal and feasibility of digital intervention approaches based in 
      contemplative practices for perinatal women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New

TI  - Breathing awareness meditation and LifeSkills Training programs influence upon 
      ambulatory blood pressure and sodium excretion among African American 
      adolescents.
PG  - 59-64
LID - 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.05.019 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of breathing awareness meditation (BAM), Botvin 
      LifeSkills Training (LST), and health education control (HEC) on ambulatory blood 
      pressure and sodium excretion in African American adolescents. METHODS: Following 
      3 consecutive days of systolic blood pressure (SBP) screenings, 166 eligible 
      participants (i.e., SBP >50th-95th percentile) were randomized by school to 
      either BAM (n = 53), LST (n = 69), or HEC (n = 44). In-school intervention 
      sessions were administered for 3 months by health education teachers. Before and 
      after the intervention, overnight urine samples and 24-hour ambulatory SBP, 
      diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were obtained. RESULTS: Significant 
      group differences were found for changes in overnight SBP and SBP, diastolic 
      blood pressure, and heart rate over the 24-hour period and during school hours. 
      The BAM treatment exhibited the greatest overall decreases on these measures 
      (Bonferroni adjusted, ps < .05). For example, for school-time SBP, BAM showed a 
      change of -3.7 mmHg compared with no change for LST and a change of -.1 mmHg for 
      HEC. There was a nonsignificant trend for overnight urinary sodium excretion (p = 
      .07), with the BAM group displaying a reduction of -.92 ± 1.1 mEq/hr compared 
      with increases of .89 ± 1.2 mEq/hr for LST and .58 ± .9 mEq/hr for HEC group. 
      CONCLUSION: BAM appears to improve hemodynamic function and may affect sodium 
      handling among African American adolescents who are at increased risk for 
      development of cardiovascular disease.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing the Attention Training Technique and 
      Mindful Self-Compassion for Students With Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety.
PG  - 827

LID - 827
AB  - The Attention Training Technique (ATT) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) are two 
      promising psychological interventions. ATT is a 12-min auditory exercise designed 
      to strengthen attentional control and promote external focus of attention, while 
      MSC uses guided meditation and exercises designed to promote self-compassion. In 
      this randomized controlled trial (RCT), a three-session intervention trial was 
      conducted in which university students were randomly assigned to either an 
      ATT-group (n = 40) or a MSC-group (n = 41). The students were not assessed with 
      diagnostic interviews but had self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or 
      stress. Participants listened to audiotapes of ATT or MSC before discussing in 
      groups how to apply these principles for their everyday struggles. Participants 
      also listened to audiotapes of ATT and MSC as homework between sessions. 
      Participants in both groups showed significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety 
      and depression accompanied by significant increases in mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and attention flexibility post-intervention. These results were 
      maintained at 6-month follow-up. Improvement in attention flexibility was the 
      only significant unique predictor of treatment response. The study supports the 
      use of both ATT and MSC for students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
      Further, it suggests that symptom improvement is related to changes in attention 
      flexibility across both theoretical frameworks. Future studies should focus on 
      how to strengthen the ability for attention flexibility to optimize treatment for 
      emotional disorder.

TI  - Making concrete construals mindful: a novel approach for developing mindfulness 
      and self-compassion to assist weight loss.
PG  - 422-41
LID - 10.1080/08870446.2013.863883 [doi]
AB  - Research on the usefulness of mindfulness and self-compassion for dieting has 
      focused on meditative practices. However, meditation can be difficult to 
      maintain, especially while dieting. Thus, the present research attempted to 
      induce mindfulness and self-compassion by using food diaries that required the 
      participant to either focus on concrete (i.e. how they are eating) construals or 
      abstract (i.e. why they are eating) construals. The concrete construals were 
      expected to increase mindfulness and self-compassion, as well as decrease 
      avoidance and negative thoughts (which would further aid the development of 
      mindfulness and self-compassion). Study 1 found that mindfulness and 
      self-compassion mediated the inverse relationship of avoidance and negative 
      thoughts with weight loss. Study 2 showed that concrete construal diaries 
      increased mindfulness and self-compassion, decreased avoidance and negative 
      thoughts, and supported weight loss significantly more than the abstract 
      construal diaries. Study 3, then, compared the concrete construal diaries with a 
      mindful self-compassionate meditation programme. There was no difference in 
      weight loss at the end of the intervention, but at a three-month follow-up, the 
      diaries performed better at weight maintenance. Thus, the concrete construal 
      diaries may promote mindfulness and self-compassion and potentially promote 
      long-term weight loss.

AB  - To determine whether MBSR groups would help gay men living with HIV improve 
      psychosocial functioning and increase mindfulness compared to treatment-as-usual 
      (TAU). METHODS: 117 participants were randomized 2:1 to MBSR or TAU. No new 
      psychosocial or psychopharmacological interventions were initiated within 2 
      months of baseline. Standardized questionnaires were administered pre-, 
      postintervention and at 6 months. An intent-to-treat analysis found significant 
      benefits of MBSR: at post-intervention and 6 months follow up, MBSR participants 
      had significantly lower avoidance in IES and higher positive affect compared to 
      controls. MBSR participants developed more mindfulness as measured by the Toronto 
      Mindfulness Scale (TMS) including both TMS subscales, curiosity and decentering, 
      at 8-week and 6 months. For the sample as a whole, increase in mindfulness was 
      significantly correlated with reduction in avoidance, higher positive affect and 
      improvement in depression at 6 months. MBSR has specific and clinically 
      meaningful effects in this population.

TI  - How does mindfulness-based cognitive therapy work?
PG  - 1105-12
LID - 10.1016/j.brat.2010.08.003 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an efficacious psychosocial 
      intervention for recurrent depression (Kuyken et al., 2008; Ma & Teasdale, 2004; 
      Teasdale et al., 2000). To date, no compelling research addresses MBCT's 
      mechanisms of change. This study determines whether MBCT's treatment effects are 
      mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment, 
      and/or by alterations in post-treatment cognitive reactivity. The study was 
      embedded in a randomized controlled trial comparing MBCT with maintenance 
      antidepressants (mADM) with 15-month follow-up (Kuyken et al., 2008). Mindfulness 
      and self-compassion were assessed before and after MBCT treatment (or at 
      equivalent time points in the mADM group). Post-treatment reactivity was assessed 
      one month after the MBCT group sessions or at the equivalent time point in the 
      mADM group. One hundred and twenty-three patients with ≥3 prior depressive 
      episodes, and successfully treated with antidepressants, were randomized either 
      to mADM or MBCT. The MBCT arm involved participation in MBCT, a group-based 
      psychosocial intervention that teaches mindfulness skills, and discontinuation of 
      ADM. The mADM arm involved maintenance on a therapeutic ADM dose for the duration 
      of follow-up. Interviewer-administered outcome measures assessed depressive 
      symptoms and relapse/recurrence across 15-month follow-up. Mindfulness and 
      self-compassion were measured using self-report questionnaire. Cognitive 
      reactivity was operationalized as change in depressive thinking during a 
      laboratory mood induction. MBCT's effects were mediated by enhancement of 
      mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment. MBCT also changed the nature of 
      the relationship between post-treatment cognitive reactivity and outcome. Greater 
      reactivity predicted worse outcome for mADM participants but this relationship 
      was not evident in the MBCT group. MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by 
      augmented self-compassion and mindfulness, along with a decoupling of the 
      relationship between reactivity of depressive thinking and poor outcome. This 
      decoupling is associated with the cultivation of self-compassion across 
      treatment.

TI  - Therapeutic mechanisms of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement for internet 
      gaming disorder: Reducing craving and addictive behavior by targeting cognitive 
      processes.
PG  - 5-13
LID - 10.1080/10550887.2018.1442617 [doi]
AB  - Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is characterized by signs and symptoms 
      similar to substance use and gambling disorders, and associated with psychosocial 
      impairments. Research suggests that maladaptive gaming-related cognitions and 
      coping may be implicated in IGD; therefore, interventions for IGD need to target 
      these underlying mechanisms. Mindfulness-based treatment is effective in changing 
      maladaptive cognitive processes and increasing adaptive coping among people with 
      addictions. Aims: This study used data from an RCT of Mindfulness-Oriented 
      Recovery Enhancement (MORE) for IGD to further examine changes in maladaptive 
      gaming-related cognitions and positive reappraisal as mediators of the effects of 
      MORE on IGD signs/symptoms. Methods: Participants (N = 30, Age M = 25.0, SD  = 
      5.4) were randomized to 8-weekly sessions of MORE or a support group (SG) control 
      condition. IGD severity, levels of craving for video game playing, maladaptive 
      gaming-related cognitions, and positive reappraisal were measured at pre-and 
      posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Multivariate path analyses 
      revealed that effects of MORE in reducing IGD and craving were statistically 
      mediated by changes in maladaptive gaming-related cognitions. Though changes in 
      positive reappraisal did not significantly mediate effects of MORE on IGD or 
      craving, MORE enhanced positive reappraisal to a significantly greater extent 
      than the SG at posttreatment. Discussion: Findings suggest that effects of 
      mindfulness treatment in reducing maladaptive gaming-related cognitions might 
      lead to reductions in IGD severity and cravings for video game playing. This 
      cognitive mechanism should be evaluated in a future, full-scale RCT.

TI  - Differential effects of mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and 
      loving-kindness meditation on decentering and negative reactions to repetitive 
      thoughts.
PG  - 1002-11
LID - 10.1016/j.brat.2010.06.006 [doi]
AB  - Decentering has been proposed as a potential mechanism of mindfulness-based 
      interventions but has received limited empirical examination to date in 
      experimental studies comparing mindfulness meditation to active comparison 
      conditions. In the present study, we compared the immediate effects of mindful 
      breathing (MB) to two alternative stress-management techniques: progressive 
      muscle relaxation (PMR) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) to test whether 
      decentering is unique to mindfulness meditation or common across approaches. 
      Novice meditators (190 female undergraduates) were randomly assigned to complete 
      one of three 15-min stress-management exercises (MB, PMR, or LKM) presented by 
      audio recording. Immediately after the exercise, participants completed measures 
      of decentering, frequency of repetitive thoughts during the exercise, and degree 
      of negative reaction to thoughts. As predicted, participants in the MB condition 
      reported greater decentering relative to the other two conditions. The 
      association between frequency of repetitive thought and negative reactions to 
      thoughts was relatively weaker in the MB condition than in the PMR and LKM 
      conditions, in which these two variables were strongly and positively correlated. 
      Consistent with the construct of decentering, the relative independence between 
      these two variables in the MB condition suggests that mindful breathing may help 
      to reduce reactivity to repetitive thoughts. Taken together, results help to 
      provide further evidence of decentering as a potential mechanism that 
      distinguishes mindfulness practice from other credible stress-management 
      approaches.

AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of breast cancer patients with negative body image has 
      increased. However, research on interventions that explicitly reduce negative 
      body image among breast cancer patients remains inadequate. The development of 
      more pragmatic interventions is imperative. Therefore, we conducted this study to 
      assess the effectiveness of a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) 
      intervention to reduce the negative body image in breast cancer patients. 
      METHODS: We randomly assigned 64 female breast cancer patients to either the MSC 
      group or the control group. The MSC group received a 6-week online Mindful 
      Self-Compassion intervention, while the control group received no psychological 
      training. Participants were surveyed by the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form 
      (SCS-SF), the Self-Acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), the Chinese Perceived Stress 
      Scale (CPSS), and the Body Image Scale (BIS) at baseline (T1), post-intervention 
      (T2), and 1-month follow-up (T3). RESULTS: All outcome variables demonstrated 
      significant time main effects and nonsignificant group main effects. The MSC and 
      control groups had significant time × group interaction effects on 
      self-compassion, self-acceptance, perceived stress, and negative body image. 
      Simple main effects analysis revealed significant improvements in outcome 
      variables at three-time points for the MSC group. CONCLUSION: A 6-week online 
      Mindful Self-Compassion intervention can improve self-compassion and 
      self-acceptance and reduce perceived stress and negative body image among the 
      breast cancer patients in MSC group. Mindful Self-Compassion intervention shows 
      promise as a viable way to maintain the mental well-being of breast cancer 
      patients.

TI  - Recovery from recurrent depression: Randomized controlled trial of the efficacy 
      of mindfulness-based compassionate living compared with treatment-as-usual on 
      depressive symptoms and its consolidation at longer term follow-up.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce 
      depressive symptoms in patients with recurrent or chronic depression. However, 
      sequential, follow-up interventions are needed to further improve outcome for 
      this group of patients. One possibility is to cultivate mechanisms thought to 
      support recovery from depression, such as (self-)compassion. The current study 
      examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based compassionate living (MBCL) in 
      recurrently depressed patients who previously received MBCT, and consolidation 
      effects of MBCL at follow-up. METHODS: Part one is a randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) comparing MBCL in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU alone. The 
      primary outcome measure was severity of depressive symptoms. Possible mediators 
      and moderators of treatment outcome were examined. Part two is an uncontrolled 
      study of both intervention- and control group on the consolidation of treatment 
      effect of MBCL over the course of a 6-months follow-up period. RESULTS: Patients 
      were recruited between July 2013 and December 2014 (N = 122). MBCL participants 
      (n = 61) showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (Cohen's 
      d = 0.35), compared to those who only received TAU (n = 61). The results at 
      6-months follow-up showed a continued improvement of depressive symptoms. 
      LIMITATIONS: As MBCL was not compared with an active control condition, we have 
      little information about the possible effectiveness of non-specific factors. 
      CONCLUSION: MBCL appears to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in a 
      population suffering from severe, prolonged, recurrent depressive symptoms. To 
      optimise the (sequential) treatment trajectory, replication of the study in a 
      prospective sequential trial is needed. Registered at 
      ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT02059200.

TI  - Online Couple-Based Meditation Intervention for Patients With Primary or 
      Metastatic Brain Tumors and Their Partners: Results of a Pilot Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and their 
      partners are at risk of experiencing high symptom burden, they are often excluded 
      from psychosocial intervention studies. Thus, we sought to examine the 
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a couple-based meditation (CBM) program 
      targeting symptom and well-being outcomes. METHODS: Couples completed baseline 
      measures assessing symptom and well-being outcomes and were randomized to the CBM 
      or a usual care control group. Couples in the CBM groups attended four weekly 
      (60 minutes each) therapist-led sessions that were delivered via FaceTime (Apple 
      Inc, Cupertino, CA). The CBM program focused on cultivating mindfulness, 
      compassion, gratitude and purpose, and integrated emotional disclosure exercises. 
      Both groups were reassessed six and 12 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: We 
      approached 60 eligible dyads, of which 37 (62%) consented, 35 (95%) were 
      randomized, and 22 (63%) completed all assessments. Couples in the CBM group 
      attended a mean of 3.33 sessions (SD 1.09). For patients, significant group 
      differences in favor of the CBM group were found for cognitive (d = 1.05) and 
      general disease symptoms (d = 0.93), and relationship well-being (d = 0.68) and 
      compassion (d = 0.96). No significant group differences were revealed for 
      partners. CONCLUSION: It seems to be feasible, acceptable, and possibly 
      efficacious to deliver a dyadic intervention via FaceTime to brain tumor couples. 
      Although both patients and partners in the CBM group rated the intervention as 
      beneficial, significant group differences with medium-to-large effect sizes were 
      only found for patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a workplace stress-reduction intervention 
      decreases reactivity to stress among personnel exposed to a highly stressful 
      occupational environment. METHODS: Personnel from a surgical intensive care unit 
      were randomized to a stress-reduction intervention or a waitlist control group. 
      The 8-week group mindfulness-based intervention included mindfulness, gentle 
      yoga, and music. Psychological and biological markers of stress were measured 1 
      week before and 1 week after the intervention. RESULTS: Levels of salivary 
      α-amylase, an index of sympathetic activation, were significantly decreased 
      between the first and second assessments in the intervention group with no 
      changes in the control group. There was a positive correlation between salivary 
      α-amylase levels and burnout scores. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that this 
      type of intervention could decrease not only reactivity to stress but also the 
      risk of burnout.

TI  - Investigation of predictors of interest in a brief mindfulness-based intervention 
      and its effects in patients with psoriasis at a rehabilitation clinic (SkinMind): 
      an observational study and randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e033952

LID - e033952
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis (PS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease accompanied 
      by reduced quality of life. Mindfulness is the ability to focus on the present 
      moment without evaluation. Findings on the effects of 8-week mindfulness 
      trainings in patients with PS reveal positive effects on the severity of the 
      disease and quality of life. However, it remained unclear what distinguishes 
      patients with PS interested in psychological interventions from those without 
      interest and whether also a shorter, namely 2-week mindfulness-based intervention 
      is beneficial in this patient group. This will be investigated with this study. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSES: Data will be collected at a rehabilitation clinic in 
      Germany. The study is divided into two parts: study 1a is an observational study. 
      Its aim is to investigate whether sociodemographic, skin-related and 
      psychological factors are significant predictors of interest in a brief 
      psychological intervention in 127 patients with PS. Study 1b is a randomised 
      controlled trial, in which 60 patients (retrieved from study 1a) will be 
      randomised to an intervention or control group (treatment as usual). The main 
      outcome variables are mindfulness and self-compassion. In addition, mediation 
      analyses will be used in an explorative manner to test whether there is a 
      relationship between mindfulness/self-compassion and the severity of PS and 
      whether it is mediated by itch catastrophising and fear of negative evaluation 
      (first model) or perceived stress (second model). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      study protocol has been approved by the University of Giessen. Study results will 
      be disseminated by publication of the results at (inter) national conferences and 
      in scientific journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: DRKS00017426 and 
      DRKS00017429.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent randomized controlled trial provided preliminary evidence 
      for the effectiveness of mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for the top 
      10% frequent attenders in primary care with persistent medically unexplained 
      symptoms (MUS). This qualitative study aims to explore working mechanisms and 
      possible barriers of MBCT in this population. METHODS: Twelve participants of the 
      trial were interviewed about their experiences. This was done before and after 
      the MBCT course, and 12 months later. Written evaluations of participants and 
      notes of participant observers were used for data-triangulation. RESULTS: In 
      total, 35 qualitative interviews were conducted. MBCT initiated a process of 
      change, starting with awareness of the present moment, the associated sensory 
      experiences, thoughts and emotions and accepting rather than resisting these. 
      Participants started to recognize their own behavioral patterns and change them, 
      thus improving self-care. Self-compassion seemed to result from and facilitate 
      this process. Main barriers were concurrent social problems and the inability or 
      unwillingness to accept symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT can start a process of change 
      in patients with persistent MUS. Awareness and acceptance of painful symptoms and 
      emotions are key factors in this process. Change of unhelpful behavioral patterns 
      and increased self-care and self-compassion can result from this process.

TI  - The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Sexual Counseling on Sexual Distress, Attitude 
      Toward Sexuality, and Body Image Concerns in Pregnant Women: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 611-618
LID - 10.1111/jmwh.13518 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual distress during pregnancy can cause a negative attitude 
      toward sexuality during pregnancy, and this can be seen especially in conjunction 
      with body image concerns. This study was conducted to determine the effects of 
      mindfulness-based sexual counseling (MBSC) on sexual distress, attitudes toward 
      sexuality, and body image concerns in pregnant women. METHODS: A randomized 
      controlled trial was conducted in a sample of women who experienced sexual 
      distress presenting to a Healthy Living Center in eastern Turkey. Women (N = 134) 
      were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week, 8-session counseling program based on 
      mindfulness (experimental group; n = 67) or treatment as usual (control group; n 
      = 67). The primary outcome of the study, sexual distress, was assessed using the 
      Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised. Secondary outcomes included attitude toward 
      sexuality, assessed using the Attitude Scale toward Sexuality during Pregnancy, 
      and body image concerns, using the Body Image Concerns during Pregnancy Scale. 
      Outcomes were compared postintervention, correcting for baseline using analysis 
      of covariance. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04900194). 
      RESULTS: Mean scores for sexual distress (7.69 vs 17.36; P < .001) and body image 
      concerns (57.76 vs 73.88; P < .001) decreased significantly in the mindfulness 
      group compared with the control group. Similarly, mean scores for attitudes 
      toward sexuality significantly improved in the mindfulness group compared with 
      the control group (133.52 vs 105.78; P < .05). DISCUSSION: MBSC is a promising 
      strategy to help women experiencing sexual distress during pregnancy to reduce 
      their levels of sexual distress, raise their positive attitudes toward sexuality, 
      and lower their body image concerns. Larger clinical trials of MBSC are 
      recommended to support introduction of MBSC into clinical practice.

AB  - There have been few qualitative investigations evaluating Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) in breast cancer populations. The nested qualitative 
      analysis reported here explores the acceptability and the perceived effect of 
      MBSR. As part of a larger randomised controlled evaluative trial, 92 participants 
      with stages 0 to III breast cancer completed a short proforma following week 8 of 
      a MBSR programme conducted at The Haven, an integrated cancer support centre in 
      London, UK in 2005-2006. Following thematic analysis, the most positive 
      experiences from participants (n = 92) were reported to be; 1) being calmer, 
      centred, at peace, connected and more confident; 2) the value of mindfulness 
      practice; 3) being more aware; 4) coping with stress, anxiety and panic; 5) 
      accepting things as they are, being less judgemental of myself and others; 6) 
      improved communication and personal relationships and 7) making time and creating 
      space for myself. All participants asked (n = 39) said that following MBSR 
      training they had become more mindful. These understandings will be able to help 
      shape the future teaching of MBSR in breast cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based 
      Childbirth and Parenting Program (MBCP) in reducing pregnant women's perceived 
      stress and preventing perinatal depression compared to an active control 
      condition. METHOD: First time pregnant women (n = 197) at risk of perinatal 
      depression were randomized to MBCP or an active control treatment, which 
      consisted of a Lamaze childbirth class. At baseline and post-intervention, 
      participants filled out questionnaires on perceived stress, depressive symptoms, 
      positive states of mind, and five facets of mindfulness. RESULTS: Compared to the 
      active control treatment, MBCP significantly reduced perceived stress (p = 0.038, 
      d = 0.30) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.004, d = 0.42), and increased positive 
      states of mind (p = 0.005, d = 0.41) and self-reported mindfulness (p = 0.039, 
      d = 0.30). Moreover, change in mindfulness possibly mediated the treatment 
      effects of MBCP on stress, depression symptoms, and positive states of mind. The 
      subscales "non-reactivity to inner experience" and "non-judging of experience" 
      seemed to have the strongest mediating effects. LIMITATIONS: The outcomes were 
      self-report questionnaires, the participants were not blinded to treatment 
      condition and the condition was confounded by number of sessions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results suggest that MBCP is more effective in decreasing perceived stress 
      and risk of perinatal depression compared to a Lamaze childbirth class. The 
      results also contribute to our understanding of the underlying psychological 
      mechanisms through which the reduction of stress and depression symptoms may 
      operate. Thus, this study increases our knowledge about efficient intervention 
      strategies to prevent perinatal depression and promote mental wellbeing among 
      pregnant women.

LID - 10.1037/a0036882 [doi]
AB  - Contemplative mental practices aim to enable individuals to develop greater 
      awareness of their own cognitive and affective states through repeated 
      examination of first-person experience. Recent cross-sectional studies of 
      long-term meditation practitioners suggest that the subjective reports of such 
      individuals are better calibrated with objective indices; however, the impact of 
      mental training on metacognitive ability has not yet been examined in a 
      randomized controlled investigation. The present study evaluated the impact of a 
      2-week meditation-training program on introspective accuracy in the domains of 
      perception and memory. Compared with an active control group that elicited no 
      change, we found that a 2-week meditation program significantly enhanced 
      introspective accuracy, quantified by metacognitive judgments of cognition on a 
      trial-by-trial basis, in a memory but not a perception domain. Together, these 
      data suggest that, in at least some domains, the human capacity to introspect is 
      plastic and can be enhanced through training.

TI  - Can a teacher-led mindfulness intervention for new school entrants improve child 
      outcomes? Protocol for a school cluster randomised controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The first years of school are critical in establishing a foundation 
      for positive long-term academic, social and well-being outcomes. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions may help students transition well into school, 
      but few robust studies have been conducted in this age group. We aim to determine 
      whether compared with controls, children who receive a mindfulness intervention 
      within the first years of primary school have better: (1) immediate 
      attention/short-term memory at 18 months post-randomisation (primary outcome); 
      (2) inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility at 18 months 
      post-randomisation; (3) socio-emotional well-being, emotion-regulation and mental 
      health-related behaviours at 6 and 18 months post-randomisation; (4) sustained 
      changes in teacher practice and classroom interactions at 18 months 
      post-randomisation. Furthermore, we aim to determine whether the implementation 
      predicts the efficacy of the intervention, and the cost effectiveness relative to 
      outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cluster randomised controlled trial will be 
      conducted in 22 primary schools in disadvantaged areas of Melbourne, Australia. 
      826 students in the first year of primary school will be recruited to detect 
      between groups differences of Cohen's d=0.25 at the 18-month follow-up. Parent, 
      teacher and child-assessment measures of child attention, emotion-regulation, 
      executive functioning, socio-emotional well-being, mental health-related 
      behaviour and learning, parent mental well-being, teacher well-being will be 
      collected 6 and 18 months post-randomisation. Implementation factors will be 
      measured throughout the study. Intention-to-treat analyses, accounting for 
      clustering within schools and classes, will adopt a two-level random effects 
      linear regression model to examine outcomes for the intervention versus control 
      students. Unadjusted and analyses adjusted for baseline scores, baseline age, 
      gender and family socioeconomic status will be conducted. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been received by the Human Research Ethics 
      Committee at the University of Melbourne. Findings will be reported in 
      peer-review publications, national and international conference presentations and 
      research snapshots directly provided to participating schools and families.

TI  - How mindfulness changed my sleep: focus groups with chronic insomnia patients.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-14-50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is a major public health problem affecting 
      approximately 10% of adults. Use of meditation and yoga to develop mindful 
      awareness ('mindfulness training') may be an effective approach to treat chronic 
      insomnia, with sleep outcomes comparable to nightly use of prescription 
      sedatives, but more durable and with minimal or no side effects. The purpose of 
      this study was to understand mindfulness training as experienced by patients with 
      chronic insomnia, and suggest procedures that may be useful in optimizing sleep 
      benefits. METHODS: Adults (N = 18) who completed an 8-week mindfulness-based 
      stress reduction (MBSR) program as part of a randomized, controlled clinical 
      trial to evaluate MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia were invited to 
      participate in post-trial focus groups. Two groups were held. Participants 
      (n = 9) described how their sleep routine, thoughts and emotions were affected by 
      MBSR and about utility (or not) of various mindfulness techniques. Groups were 
      audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Four 
      themes were identified: the impact of mindfulness on sleep and motivation to 
      adopt a healthy sleep lifestyle; benefits of mindfulness on aspects of life 
      beyond sleep; challenges and successes in adopting mindfulness-based practices; 
      and the importance of group sharing and support. Participants said they were not 
      sleeping more, but sleeping better, waking more refreshed, feeling less 
      distressed about insomnia, and better able to cope when it occurred. Some 
      participants experienced the course as a call to action, and for them, practicing 
      meditation and following sleep hygiene guidelines became priorities. Motivation 
      to sustain behavioral changes was reinforced by feeling physically better and 
      more emotionally stable, and seeing others in the MBSR class improve. The body 
      scan was identified as an effective tool to enable falling asleep faster. 
      Participants described needing to continue practicing mindfulness to maintain 
      benefits. CONCLUSIONS: First-person accounts are consistent with published trial 
      results of positive impacts of MBSR on sleep measured by sleep diary, actigraphy, 
      and self-report sleep scales. Findings indicate that mindfulness training in a 
      group format, combined with sleep hygiene education, is important for effective 
      application of MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia.

LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbp080 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) evolved from behavioral theory and developed to 
      focus more on cognitive models that incorporated reappraisal of thinking errors 
      and schema change strategies. This article will describe the key elements of CBT 
      for schizophrenia and the current evidence of its efficacy and effectiveness. We 
      conclude with a description of recent concepts that extend the theoretical basis 
      of practice and expand the range of CBT strategies for use in schizophrenia. 
      Mindfulness, meta-cognitive approaches, compassionate mind training, and method 
      of levels are postulated as useful adjuncts for CBT with psychotic patients.

TI  - Metta-based group meditation and individual cognitive behavioral therapy (MeCBT) 
      for chronic depression: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 20

LID - 20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a widespread disorder with severe impacts for 
      individuals and society, especially in its chronic form. Current treatment 
      approaches for persistent depression have focused primarily on reducing negative 
      affect and have paid little attention to promoting positive affect. Previous 
      studies have shown that metta meditation increases positive affect in chronically 
      depressed patients. Results from previous trials provide evidence for the 
      efficacy of a stand-alone metta meditation group treatment in combination with 
      mindfulness-based approaches. Further research is needed to better understand the 
      implementation of meditation practice into everyday life. Therefore, mindfulness 
      and metta meditation in a group setting are combined with individual cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) into a new, low-intensity, cost-effective treatment 
      ("MeCBT") for chronic depression. METHODS/DESIGN: In this single-center, 
      randomized, observer-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial we will test the 
      efficacy of MeCBT in reducing depression compared to a wait-list control 
      condition. Forty-eight participants in a balanced design will be allocated 
      randomly to a treatment group or a wait-list control group. Metta-based group 
      meditation will be offered in eight weekly sessions and one additional half-day 
      retreat. Subsequent individual CBT will be conducted in eight fortnightly 
      sessions. Outcome measures will be assessed at four time points: before 
      intervention (T0); after group meditation (T1); after individual CBT (T2); and, 
      in the treated group only, at 6-month follow-up (T3). Changes in depressive 
      symptoms (clinician rating), assessed with the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
      Symptoms (QIDS-C) are the primary outcome. We expect a significant decline of 
      depressive symptoms at T2 compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary 
      outcome measures include self-rated depression, mindfulness, benevolence, 
      rumination, emotion regulation, social connectedness, social functioning, as well 
      as behavioral and cognitive avoidance. We will explore changes at T1 and T2 in 
      all these secondary outcome variables. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the 
      first study to combine a group program focusing on Metta meditation with 
      state-of-the art individual CBT specifically tailored to chronic depression. 
      Implications for further refinement and examination of the treatment program are 
      discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN97264476. Registered 29 March 2018

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in High School and College Athletes 
      for Reducing Stress and Injury, and Improving Quality of Life.
PG  - 578-587
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2016-0047 [doi]
AB  - Clinical Scenario: Student athletes experience a variety of stressors from school 
      and social activities, as well as the additional demands of sport participation. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions can help increase mental awareness and 
      acceptance, as well as mitigate negative thoughts and emotions. The use of 
      mindfulness-based interventions may be beneficial for reducing thoughts of 
      stress, injury reduction, and improving overall wellbeing. CLINICAL QUESTION: 
      Does the use of mindfulness-based interventions for student-athletes aged 13-24 
      years reduce stress and injury as well as improve overall quality of life? 
      SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The literature was searched for studies that investigated 
      the use of mindfulness-based strategies for student-athletes specifically for 
      reducing stress and injury and/or improving quality of life. The literature 
      search returned 8 possible studies related to the clinical question and 3 studies 
      met the inclusion criteria (1 randomized control trial, 2 nonrandomized control 
      cohort studies). All 3 included studies demonstrated overall improved levels of 
      mindfulness among student-athletes after the use of a mindfulness-based 
      intervention. Mindfulness-based interventions had positive effects for reducing 
      negative thoughts and levels of perceived stress. The number of injury 
      occurrences were found to decrease following the integration of a 
      mindfulness-based intervention within an athletic population. Clinical Bottom 
      Line: There is sufficient evidence supporting the use of mindfulness-based 
      interventions with student-athletes for increasing mindfulness, managing negative 
      emotions and perceived stress, as well as improving overall well-being. There is 
      also current literature that advocates the use of mindfulness-based interventions 
      for reducing injury, but further research is needed for support. Strength of 
      Recommendation: Grade B evidence exists to support that the use of 
      mindfulness-based interventions for student-athletes will reduce stress and 
      improve overall well-being as well as support the possibility that if a 
      student-athlete is more mindful, it may help decrease risk of injury incurred if 
      the student-athlete is under mental stress.

TI  - A novel mindful-compassion art therapy (MCAT) for reducing burnout and promoting 
      resilience for end-of-life care professionals: a waitlist RCT protocol.
PG  - 406
LID - 10.1186/s13063-019-3533-y [doi]
LID - 406
AB  - INTRODUCTION: End-of-life (EoL) care professionals are prone to burnout given the 
      intense emotional nature of their work. Previous research supports the efficacy 
      of art therapy in reducing work-related stress and enhancing emotional health 
      among professional EoL caregivers. Integrating mindfulness meditation with art 
      therapy and reflective awareness complementing emotional expression has immense 
      potential for self-care and collegial support. Mindful-compassion art therapy 
      (MCAT) is a novel, empirically informed, and highly structured intervention that 
      aims to reduce work-related stress, cultivate resilience, and promote wellness. 
      This study aims to assess the potential effectiveness of MCAT for supporting EoL 
      care professionals in Singapore. METHODS: This is an open-label waitlist 
      randomized controlled trial. Sixty EoL care professionals, including doctors, 
      nurses, social workers, and personal care workers, are randomly allocated to one 
      of two groups: (i) an intervention group that receives MCAT immediately and (ii) 
      a waitlist-control group that receives MCAT after the intervention group 
      completes treatment. Face-to-face self-administered outcome assessments are 
      collected at three different time points-baseline (T1) for both groups, 
      post-intervention (T2), and 6-week follow-up (T3) for intervention group-as well 
      as pre-intervention (T2) and post-intervention (T3) for the waitlist-control 
      group. The primary outcome measure is burnout, and secondary measures include 
      emotional regulation, resilience, compassion, quality of life, and death 
      attitudes. Between- and within-participant comparisons of outcomes are conducted, 
      and the appropriate effect size estimates are reported. An acceptability and 
      feasibility study is to be conducted by using a triangulation of qualitative data 
      with framework analysis. DISCUSSION: The outcomes of this study will contribute 
      to advancements in both theories and practices for supporting professional EoL 
      caregivers around the world. It will also inform policy makers about the 
      feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of delivering a multimodal 
      psycho-socio-spiritual intervention within a community institutional setting. The 
      study has received ethical approval from the institutional review board of 
      Nanyang Technological University. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on risk and protective factors 
      of depressive relapse - a randomized wait-list controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized wait-list controlled trial was to explore 
      the effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on risk and protective 
      factors for depressive relapse within the domains of cognition, emotion and 
      self-relatedness. METHODS: Sixty-eight individuals with recurrent depressive 
      disorder were randomized to MBCT or a wait-list control condition (WLC). RESULTS: 
      Completers of MBCT (N = 26) improved significantly on measures assessing risk and 
      protective factors of recurrent depression compared to WLC (N = 30) on measures 
      of rumination (d = 0.59, p = .015), emotion regulation (d = 0.50, p = .028), 
      emotional reactivity to stress (d = 0.32, p = .048), self-compassion (d = 1.02, 
      p < .001), mindfulness (d = 0.59, p = .010), and depression (d = 0.40, p = .018). 
      In the Intention To Treat sample, findings were attenuated, but there were still 
      significant results on measures of rumination, self-compassion and depression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the present trial contribute to evidence that MBCT can 
      lead to reduction in risk factors of depressive relapse, and strengthening of 
      factors known to be protective of depressive relapse. The largest changes were 
      found in the domain of self-relatedness, in the form of large effects on the 
      participants' ability to be less self-judgmental and more self-compassionate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over recent decades, the number of students diagnosed with learning 
      disabilities and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders has substantially 
      increased. These students face various challenges and experience stress when 
      receiving higher education. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to compare two 
      non-pharmacological interventions: mindfulness and device-guided slow breathing, 
      with a control group. METHODS: Seventy-three students (age = 25.76, std. 
      dev = 3.10) with attention problems and/or learning disabilities were randomly 
      assigned to three groups: mindfulness meditation, device guided breathing 
      practice and waiting-list control. Before and after the intervention 
      physiological and psychological measures were collected. RESULTS: Our results 
      show that only mindfulness practice improved awareness of the present moment and 
      decreased hyperactivity and inattention. Furthermore, both mindfulness and 
      practice with device-guided breathing were associated with stress reduction, as 
      shown by an increase in the galvanic skin response only in the control group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the study results may lead to an advance in 
      treating attention deficit disorders and learning disabilities, especially among 
      higher education students.

TI  - Associations of mindfulness with depressive symptoms and well-being in older 
      adults: the moderating role of neuroticism.
PG  - 455-460
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2017.1423027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether observed interactions of mindfulness with the 
      personality trait neuroticism extend to older adults and to aspects of 
      psychological functioning other than depressive symptoms, and whether effects of 
      mindfulness training in this population depend on levels of neuroticism. METHOD: 
      We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for community-dwelling older adults. We 
      investigated whether neuroticism moderates associations of dispositional 
      mindfulness with various aspects of psychological and physical functioning at 
      baseline, as well as effects of MBSR on these outcomes. RESULTS: Significant 
      two-way interactions showed that greater mindfulness was associated with fewer 
      depressive symptoms and less negative affect at baseline in individuals with 
      average or higher levels of neuroticism. In contrast, mindfulness was associated 
      with greater positive affect and vitality and fewer physical symptoms regardless 
      of the level of neuroticism. There were no effects of MBSR on these outcomes at 
      any level of neuroticism. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness may be more protective against 
      psychological ill-being in older adults with higher levels of neuroticism, but 
      conducive to positive psychological and physical well-being regardless of this 
      personality trait. The potential moderating role of neuroticism should be further 
      evaluated in studies of mindfulness-based interventions in older adults.

TI  - Breathing-based meditation decreases posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in 
      U.S. military veterans: a randomized controlled longitudinal study.
PG  - 397-405
LID - 10.1002/jts.21936 [doi]
AB  - Given the limited success of conventional treatments for veterans with 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), investigations of alternative approaches 
      are warranted. We examined the effects of a breathing-based meditation 
      intervention, Sudarshan Kriya yoga, on PTSD outcome variables in U.S. male 
      veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan war. We randomly assigned 21 veterans to an 
      active (n = 11) or waitlist control (n = 10) group. Laboratory measures of 
      eye-blink startle and respiration rate were obtained before and after the 
      intervention, as were self-report symptom measures; the latter were also obtained 
      1 month and 1 year later. The active group showed reductions in PTSD scores, d = 
      1.16, 95% CI [0.20, 2.04], anxiety symptoms, and respiration rate, but the 
      control group did not. Reductions in startle correlated with reductions in 
      hyperarousal symptoms immediately postintervention (r = .93, p < .001) and at 
      1-year follow-up (r = .77, p = .025). This longitudinal intervention study 
      suggests there may be clinical utility for Sudarshan Kriya yoga for PTSD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The demand for effective psychological treatments for depression, 
      anxiety, and heightened stress is far outstripping their supply. Accordingly, 
      internet delivered, self-help interventions offer hope to many people, as they 
      can be easily accessed and at a fraction of the price of face-to-face options. 
      Mindfulness and self-compassion are particularly exciting approaches, as evidence 
      suggests interventions that cultivate these skills are effective in reducing 
      depression, anxiety, and heightened stress. We examined the effectiveness of a 
      newly developed program that combines mindfulness, self-compassion, and 
      goal-setting exercises into a brief self-guided intervention (Mind-OP). The 
      secondary aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a 
      randomized-controlled trial entirely on a popular crowdsourcing platform, 
      Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). METHODS: We randomized 456 participants 
      reporting heightened depression, anxiety, or stress to one of two conditions: the 
      4-week Mind-OP intervention (n = 227) or to an active control condition (n = 229) 
      where participants watched nature videos superimposed onto relaxing meditation 
      music for four consecutive weeks. We administered measures of anxiety, 
      depression, perceived stress, dispositional and state mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, and nonattachment. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat and per-protocol 
      analyses revealed that, compared to participants in the control condition, 
      participants in the Mind-OP intervention condition reported significantly less 
      anxiety and stress at the end of the trial, as well as significantly greater 
      mindfulness, self-compassion, and nonattachment. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-OP appears 
      effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and perceived stress among MTurk 
      participants. We highlight issues (e.g., attrition) related to feasibility of 
      conducting randomized trials on crowdsourcing platforms such as MTurk.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Mental Health of Clinical 
      Clerkship Students: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1012-1021
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001546 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction training 
      (MBSR) on the mental health of medical students during clinical clerkships. 
      METHOD: Between February 2011 and May 2014, the authors conducted a 
      cluster-randomized controlled trial of clerkships as usual (CAU) and clerkships 
      with additional MBSR in medical students during their first year of clinical 
      clerkships at a Dutch university medical center. MBSR consisted of eight weekly 
      two-hour sessions, comprising didactic teaching, meditation exercises, and group 
      dialogues. Students completed online assessments at baseline and after 3, 7, 12, 
      15, and 20 months. Outcome measures were psychological distress, positive mental 
      health, life satisfaction, physician empathy, mindfulness skills, and 
      dysfunctional cognitions as measured by validated tools. RESULTS: Of 232 eligible 
      students, 167 students (72%) participated and were randomized by clerkship group 
      into MBSR (n = 83) or CAU (n = 84). The MBSR group reported a small reduction of 
      psychological distress (P = .03, Cohen's d = 0.20) and dysfunctional cognitions 
      (P = .05, Cohen's d = 0.18) and a moderate increase of positive mental health (P 
      = .002, Cohen's d = 0.44), life satisfaction (P = .01, Cohen's d = 0.51), and 
      mindfulness skills (P = .05, Cohen's d = 0.35) compared with CAU during the 
      20-month follow-up. The authors detected no significant effect on physician 
      empathy (P = .18, Cohen's d = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: MBSR appeared feasible and 
      acceptable to medical clerkship students and resulted in a small to moderate 
      improvement of mental health compared with CAU over the 20-month follow-up.

TI  - The effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for reducing rumination 
      and improving mindfulness and self-compassion in patients with 
      treatment-resistant depression.

AB  - Introduction Depression is one of the most important psychiatric disorders, and 
      the rate of recurrence is high. The heavy cost burden of depression is probably 
      due to treatment-resistant depression. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in patients with 
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Method The present study was a 
      quasi-experimental study conducted with twenty-four patients with 
      treatment-resistant depression. Participants were selected by purposive sampling 
      and randomly assigned to two groups, an experimental group and a control group. 
      The experimental group received MBCT and antidepressants, while the control group 
      received antidepressants only. The Hamilton and Beck Depression Inventory, 
      Self-Compassion Scale, Thought Rumination Scale, and Mindfulness Scale were 
      administered. The treatment program was conducted in eight sessions; with a 
      follow-up period of one month subsequent to treatment termination. Data were 
      analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and 
      inferential statistics (analysis of variance for repeated measures and 
      Bonferroni's post-hoc test). Results The results showed that MBCT significantly 
      reduced depression and ruminative thinking in the experimental group and also 
      improved mediators such as mindfulness and self-compassion. Patients maintained 
      gains over the one month follow-up period (p < 0.01). Conclusion The present 
      study provides additional evidence for the effectiveness of MBCT for TRD.

TI  - Feasibility of the Internet Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy in the General 
      Population: Protocol for an Open-Label Uncontrolled Pilot Trial.
PG  - e16717
LID - 10.2196/16717 [doi]
LID - e16717
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compassion-based interventions delivered over the internet are 
      showing promising results for the promotion of psychological health and 
      well-being. Several studies have highlighted their feasibility, acceptance, and 
      preliminary efficacy. However, this is an incipient field of research, and to the 
      best of our knowledge, there are no data available from Spanish-speaking 
      countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, 
      acceptance, and preliminary efficacy of the Internet Attachment-Based Compassion 
      Therapy (iABCT), a web-based version of the Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy, 
      in Spanish speakers from the general population. METHODS: This feasibility study 
      features a single-arm, uncontrolled, within-group design with an embedded 
      qualitative and quantitative process evaluation at baseline, immediately after 
      the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up. A minimum of 35 participants from 
      the general population will be allocated to iABCT. Feasibility measures will 
      include attrition rate, patterns of use of the web-based system, and 
      participants' acceptability, usability, and opinion. The primary outcome was 
      measured using the Pemberton Happiness Index. Secondary outcomes were measured 
      using the Compassion Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Forms of 
      Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale-Short form, Five Facets of 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire, Relationships Questionnaire, General Health 
      Questionnaire, Non-Attachment Scale, International Positive and Negative Affect 
      Schedule Short Form, Purpose-In-Life Test, and difficulties regarding the 
      practice of compassion (Compassion Practice Quality Questionnaire). Mixed models 
      will be used to evaluate primary and secondary outcome measures. A qualitative 
      content analysis of the participants' qualitative responses will also be 
      performed. RESULTS: Enrollment started in February 2020 and will be finished in 
      April 2020. Data analysis will start in October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: To our 
      knowledge, this study will, for the first time, show data on the feasibility, 
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of web-based compassion (and 
      self-compassion) training-that is, the adapted iABCT-in Spanish speakers from the 
      general population. Further aspects of their implementation (ie, facilitators, 
      barriers, and unwanted effects) and mechanisms of change will be investigated. 
      This study will allow the revision and fine-tuning of the developed intervention, 
      study design, and planning procedures, as well as the initiation of a future 
      randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03918746.

TI  - Group and Individual Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) Are Both 
      Effective: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial in Depressed People with a Somatic 
      Disease.
PG  - 1339-1346
AB  - Depressive symptoms are commonly reported by individuals suffering from a chronic 
      medical condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to 
      be an effective psychological intervention for reducing depressive symptoms in a 
      range of populations. MBCT is traditionally given in a group format. The aim of 
      the current pilot RCT was to examine the effects of group-based MBCT and 
      individually based MBCT for reducing depressive symptoms in adults suffering from 
      one or more somatic diseases. In this study, 56 people with a somatic condition 
      and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II] 
      ≥14) were randomized to group MBCT (n = 28) or individual MBCT (n = 28). Patients 
      filled out questionnaires at three points in time (i.e., pre-intervention, 
      post-intervention, 3 months follow-up). Primary outcome measure was severity of 
      depressive symptoms. Anxiety and positive well-being as well as mindfulness and 
      self-compassion were also assessed. We found significant improvements in all 
      outcomes in those receiving group or individual MBCT, with no significant 
      differences between the two conditions regarding these improvements. Although 
      preliminary (given the pilot nature and lack of control group), results suggest 
      that both group MBCT and individual MBCT are associated with improvements in 
      psychological well-being and enhanced skills of mindfulness and self-compassion 
      in individuals with a chronic somatic condition and comorbid depressive symptoms. 
      Our findings merit future non-inferiority trials in larger samples to be able to 
      draw more firm conclusions about the effectiveness of both formats of MBCT.

TI  - Open hearts build lives: positive emotions, induced through loving-kindness 
      meditation, build consequential personal resources.
PG  - 1045-1062
LID - 10.1037/a0013262 [doi]
AB  - B. L. Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions 
      asserts that people's daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time 
      to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this 
      build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n = 139), half of 
      whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. 
      Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in 
      daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a 
      wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, 
      social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in 
      personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive 
      symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change 
      for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness 
      meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way 
      that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of guided meditation and music interventions on 
      patient anxiety, pain, and fatigue during imaging-guided breast biopsy. METHODS: 
      After giving informed consent, 121 women needing percutaneous imaging-guided 
      breast biopsy were randomized into three groups: (1) guided meditation; (2) 
      music; (3) standard-care control group. During biopsy, the meditation and music 
      groups listened to an audio-recorded, guided, loving-kindness meditation and 
      relaxing music, respectively; the standard-care control group received supportive 
      dialogue from the biopsy team. Immediately before and after biopsy, participants 
      completed questionnaires measuring anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale), 
      biopsy pain (Brief Pain Inventory), and fatigue (modified Functional Assessment 
      of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue). After biopsy, participants completed 
      questionnaires assessing radiologist-patient communication (modified 
      Questionnaire on the Quality of Physician-Patient Interaction), demographics, and 
      medical history. RESULTS: The meditation and music groups reported significantly 
      greater anxiety reduction (P values < .05) and reduced fatigue after biopsy than 
      the standard-care control group; the standard-care control group reported 
      increased fatigue after biopsy. The meditation group additionally showed 
      significantly lower pain during biopsy, compared with the music group (P = .03). 
      No significant difference in patient-perceived quality of radiologist-patient 
      communication was noted among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Listening to guided meditation 
      significantly lowered biopsy pain during imaging-guided breast biopsy; meditation 
      and music reduced patient anxiety and fatigue without compromising 
      radiologist-patient communication. These simple, inexpensive interventions could 
      improve women's experiences during core-needle breast biopsy.

TI  - Attachment-based compassion therapy and adapted mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction for the treatment of depressive, anxious and adjustment disorders in 
      mental health settings: a randomised controlled clinical trial protocol.
PG  - e029909
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029909 [doi]
LID - e029909
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders are highly prevalent 
      among mental health outpatients. The lack of funding for mental health problems 
      produces inefficient results and a high burden of disease. New cost-effective 
      group interventions aimed at treating these symptoms might be an appropriate 
      solution to reduce the healthcare burden in mental health units. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown significant reductions in 
      anxious, depressive and adjustment symptomatology. Recent research highlights the 
      influence of compassion as a key mechanism of change. However, MBIs only address 
      compassion implicitly, whereas compassion-based protocols consider it a core 
      aspect of psychotherapy. In this randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that 
      the provision of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT), which is a 
      compassion-based protocol, will be more effective than mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction (MBSR), which is a conventional MBI programme, for the treatment of 
      depressive, anxious and adaptive symptoms in patients in mental health settings. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Approximately 90 patients suffering from depressive, 
      anxious or adjustment disorders recruited from Spanish mental health settings 
      will be randomised to receive 8 weekly 2 hours group sessions of ABCT, 8 weekly 
      2.5 hours group sessions of adapted MBSR (with no full-day silent retreat) or 
      treatment as usual (TAU), with a 1:1:1 allocation rate. Patients in the ABCT and 
      adapted MBSR groups will also receive TAU. The main outcome will be general 
      affective distress measured by means of the 'Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21' 
      at post-test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be quality of life, 
      mindfulness, self-compassion and the use of healthcare services. There will be a 
      6-month follow-up assessment. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted using 
      linear mixed models. Per-protocol and secondary outcome analyses will be 
      performed. A data monitoring committee comprising the trial manager, the ABCT and 
      MBSR teachers and an independent clinical psychologist will monitor for possible 
      negative side effects. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was obtained from the 
      Ethics Committee of the General University Hospital of Castellón, Spain. The 
      results will be submitted to peer-reviewed specialised journals, and brief 
      reports will be sent to participants on request. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      NCT03425487.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are quite prevalent in Primary Care (PC) 
      settings. The treatment as usual (TAU) in PC is pharmacotherapy, despite the high 
      relapse rates it produces. Many patients would prefer psychotherapy, but 
      specialized services are overloaded. Studies that apply Mindfulness-Based 
      Interventions (MBIs) for the treatment of depression have obtained significant 
      improvements. Brief low-intensity approaches delivered from PC could be a 
      promising approach. This study aims to compare a low-intensity mindfulness 
      intervention for the treatment of depression in PC using different intervention 
      formats - a face-to-face MBI delivered in a group and the same MBI individually 
      applied on the Internet - to a control group that will receive PC medical 
      treatment as usual. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be 
      conducted in PC, with about 120 depressed patients allocated (1:1:1) to three 
      groups: "face-to-face MBI + TAU", "Internet-delivered MBI + TAU", and "TAU 
      alone". The MBI programs will be composed of four modules. The primary outcome 
      will be depressive symptoms, measured through the Beck Depression Inventory, 
      assessed at pre- and post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Other 
      outcomes will be mindfulness, happiness, affectivity, quality of life, and the 
      use of healthcare services. Intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models 
      adjusted for baseline scores and routine sociodemographic analysis that could 
      show baseline differences will be conducted. Per-protocol secondary outcome 
      analyses will also be performed. DISCUSSION: This is the first Spanish RCT to 
      apply a low-intensity face-to-face MBI (plus TAU) to treat depression in PC 
      settings compared to TAU (alone). Moreover, this study will also make it possible 
      to evaluate the same MBI program (plus TAU), but Internet-delivered, considering 
      their cost-effectiveness. Positive results from this RCT might have an important 
      impact on mental health settings, helping to decrease the overload of the system 
      and offering treatment alternatives beyond antidepressant medication through 
      high-quality, flexible PC interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov

TI  - Effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on psychological distress, 
      well-being, and maternal self-efficacy in breast-feeding mothers: results of a 
      pilot study.
PG  - 227-36
LID - 10.1007/s00737-013-0337-z [doi]
AB  - Several pilot studies have provided evidence that mindfulness-based intervention 
      is beneficial during pregnancy, yet its effects in mothers during the early 
      parenting period are unknown. The purpose of the present pilot study was to 
      examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention in breast-feeding 
      mothers. We developed and tested an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention aimed 
      at improving maternal self-efficacy, mindfulness, self-compassion, satisfaction 
      with life, and subjective happiness, and at reducing psychological distress. A 
      randomized controlled, between-groups design was used with treatment and control 
      groups (n = 26) and pretest and posttest measures. ANCOVA results indicated that, 
      compared to the control group, mothers in the treatment group scored 
      significantly higher on maternal self-efficacy, some dimensions of mindfulness 
      (observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity), and 
      self-compassion (self-kindness, mindfulness, over-identification, and total 
      self-compassion). In addition, mothers who received the treatment exhibited 
      significantly less anxiety, stress, and psychological distress. The results 
      supported previous research findings about the benefits of mindfulness-based 
      intervention in women from the perinatal and postpartum periods through the early 
      parenting period. Additional research is needed to validate our findings in 
      non-breast-feeding mothers and to examine the intervention's indirect benefits in 
      terms of family relationships and child development.

TI  - Study protocol for a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial of SKY breathing 
      meditation versus cognitive processing therapy for PTSD among veterans.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating, highly 
      prevalent condition. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend 
      trauma-focused psychotherapy (eg, cognitive processing therapy; CPT) as the 
      first-line treatment for PTSD. However, while these treatments show clinically 
      meaningful symptom improvement, the majority of those who begin treatment retain 
      a diagnosis of PTSD post-treatment. Perhaps for this reason, many individuals 
      with PTSD have sought more holistic, mind-body, complementary and integrative 
      health (CIH) interventions. However, there remains a paucity of high-quality, 
      active controlled efficacy studies of CIH interventions for PTSD, which precludes 
      their formal recommendation. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We present the protocol for an 
      ongoing non-inferiority parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
      comparing the efficacy of a breathing meditation intervention (Sudarshan Kriya 
      Yoga [SKY]) to a recommended evidence-based psychotherapy (CPT) for PTSD among 
      veterans. Assessors are blinded to treatment group. The primary outcome measure 
      is the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and a combination of clinical, 
      self-report, experimental and physiological outcome measures assess 
      treatment-related changes across each of the four PTSD symptom clusters 
      (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions or mood and 
      hyperarousal/reactivity). Once the RCT is completed, analyses will use both an 
      intent-to-treat (using the 'last observation carried forward' for missing data) 
      and a per-protocol or 'treatment completers' procedure, which is the most 
      rigorous approach to non-inferiority designs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: To the 
      best of our knowledge, this is this first non-inferiority RCT of SKY versus CPT 
      for PTSD among veterans. The protocol is approved by the Stanford University 
      Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written informed consent 
      prior to participation. Results from this RCT will inform future studies 
      including larger multi-site efficacy RCTs of SKY for PTSD and other mental health 
      conditions, as well as exploration of cost-effectiveness and evaluation of 
      implementation issues. Results will also inform evidence-based formal 
      recommendations regarding CIH interventions for PTSD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - A pilot randomised trial comparing a mindfulness-based stress reduction course, a 
      locally-developed stress reduction intervention and a waiting list control group 
      in a real-life municipal health care setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to conduct a pilot randomised 
      controlled trial (RCT) to lend support to a larger effectiveness RCT comparing 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a locally-developed stress reduction 
      intervention (LSR) and a waiting list control group in a Danish municipal health 
      care center setting. METHODS: A three-armed parallel pilot RCT was conducted 
      among 71 adults who contacted a Danish municipal health care center due to 
      stress-related problems. Recruitment was made between January and April 2018 and 
      followed usual procedures. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) acute treatment-demanding 
      clinical depression or diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia, 2) abuse of 
      alcohol, drugs, medicine, 3) pregnancy. Randomisation was performed by an 
      independent data manager using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The 
      primary outcome was a description of RCT feasibility (recruitment and retention 
      rates regarding intervention participation and 12-week follow-up). Secondary 
      outcomes were completion rates regarding questionnaire data and proposed 
      effect-estimates of outcome measures considered to be used in the following real 
      RCT. Type of intervention and outcome assessment were not blinded. RESULTS: We 
      recruited 71 of 129 eligible individuals from the target population (55, 95%CI: 
      46-64). Forty-two (59%) were females. Median age: 44 years (1-quartile:34, 
      3-quartile:50). Twenty-nine (41%) had < 16 years of education. Forty-eight (68%) 
      were employed; 30 of these 48 (63%) were on sick leave. Mean scores for perceived 
      stress (PSS): 25.4 ± 5.3; symptoms of anxiety and depression (SCL-5): 2.9 ± 0.6, 
      and well-being (WHO-5): 31.7 ± 8.5 indicated a need for intervention. 16/24 (67, 
      95%CI: 45 to 84) who were allocated to MBSR and 17/23 (74, 95%CI: 52 to 90) who 
      were allocated to LSR participated in ≥5 sessions. The loss to follow-up at 
      12 weeks: MBSR: 5 (21% (95% CI: 7 to 42), LSR: 5 (22% (95% CI: 7 to 44) and 
      waiting list: 4 (17% (95% CI: 5 to 37). This was acceptable and evenly 
      distributed. The results indicated MBSR to be superior. CONCLUSIONS: An RCT 
      assessing the effectiveness of stress reduction interventions in a real-life 
      municipal health care setting is feasible among adults with a clear need for 
      stress reduction interventions based on scores on mental health. TRIAL

TI  - Divergent effects of brief contemplative practices in response to an acute 
      stressor: A randomized controlled trial of brief breath awareness, 
      loving-kindness, gratitude or an attention control practice.
PG  - e0207765
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0207765 [doi]
LID - e0207765
AB  - Mindfulness practices are increasingly being utilized as a method for cultivating 
      well-being. The term mindfulness is often used as an umbrella for a variety of 
      different practices and many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) contain 
      multiple styles of practice. Despite the diversity of practices within MBIs, few 
      studies have investigated whether constituent practices produce specific effects. 
      We randomized 156 undergraduates to one of four brief practices: breath 
      awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude, or to an attention control condition. We 
      assessed practice effects on affect following brief training, and effects on 
      affect and behavior after provocation with a stressor (i.e., Cold pressor test). 
      Results indicate that gratitude training significantly improved positive affect 
      compared to breath awareness (d = 0.58) and loving-kindness led to significantly 
      greater reductions in implicit negative affect compared to the control condition 
      (d = 0.59) immediately after brief practice. In spite of gains in positive 
      affect, the gratitude group demonstrated increased reactivity to the stressor, 
      reporting the CPT as significantly more aversive than the control condition (d = 
      0.46) and showing significantly greater increases in negative affect compared to 
      the breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 
      respectively). Greater gains in implicit positive affect following gratitude 
      training predicted decreased post-stressor likability ratings of novel neutral 
      faces compared to breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = - 
      0.39, -0.40, -0.33, respectively) as well. Moreover, the gratitude group was 
      significantly less likely to donate time than the loving-kindness group in an 
      ecologically valid opportunity to provide unrewarded support. These data suggest 
      that different styles of contemplative practice may produce different effects in 
      the context of brief, introductory practice and these differences may be 
      heightened by stress. Implications for the study of contemplative practices are 
      discussed.

TI  - Feasibility, acceptability, and depression outcomes of a randomized controlled 
      trial of Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens (MSC-T) for adolescents with 
      subsyndromal depression.
PG  - 322-336
LID - 10.1002/jad.12277 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adolescents are experiencing high rates of depressive symptoms, 
      with negative consequences to their long-term health. Group-based, mindful 
      self-compassion programs show promise in mitigating the development of more 
      significant depression in at-risk adolescents. However, the lack of 
      well-designed, active control conditions has limited the ability to examine the 
      efficacy of such interventions. METHODS: Fifty-nine adolescents (M(age)  = 15.81, 
      70% female) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms from the Southeastern US were 
      randomized to group-based Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens (N = 30) or a newly 
      developed active control Healthy Lifestyles group (N = 29) during 2018 and 2019. 
      Participants attended 8 weekly "main" sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation 
      sessions. The feasibility and acceptability of participation in both groups were 
      measured using attrition, attendance, credibility, and satisfaction data. 
      Depression scores were collected weekly, and self-compassion scores were 
      collected five times across 36 weeks. RESULTS: Both groups were equally feasible 
      and acceptable during the 8-week program period; however, monthly continuation 
      sessions were poorly attended in both groups. The risk of developing clinically 
      significant depression was 2.6 times higher in the control group compared with 
      the self-compassion group (p = .037) across 36 weeks. Depression significantly 
      decreased in the self-compassion group, while it significantly increased in the 
      control group. Both groups increased significantly in reports of self-compassion. 
      These findings are on par with results noting the efficacy of cognitive-based 
      interventions for high-risk adolescents; follow-up studies with larger sample 
      sizes should be conducted to confirm these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Initial 
      examination suggests Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens programming is feasible, 
      acceptable, and efficacious in preventing the development of clinically 
      significant depression in adolescents with subsyndromal depression. Future 
      studies may benefit from refinements to the self-compassion measurement and/or 
      the attention control condition; moreover, larger sample sizes are needed to 
      confirm results.

TI  - A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Among People Recovering from Mental Illness: 
      A Tailored Mindfulness-Based Intervention versus Relaxation Training.
PG  - 318-348
LID - 10.1080/26408066.2023.2281418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed the potential effectiveness, acceptability and 
      feasibility of a tailored mindfulness-based intervention (MBI, REMIND 2.0) for 
      personal recovery among people with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      METHODS: In this pilot mixed methods randomized controlled trial, participants 
      were assigned to either the MBI (n = 14) or the relaxation training (RT) 
      (n = 14). Quantitative measures were used to assess primary outcomes, including 
      personal recovery, mindfulness, self-compassion, resilience, and secondary 
      outcomes, including depression, stress, anxiety, positive and negative moods, 
      quality of life and general health at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 
      one-month follow-up (T2). Quantitative interviews were conducted to explore the 
      experiences and perceptions toward the MBI. RESULTS: Results indicated 
      significant group and time interactions for all outcomes except anxiety and 
      stress. MBI participants showed significant improvements in all outcomes at T1, 
      which were maintained at T2, except for positive mood. RT participants showed a 
      significant decline in resilience but significant improvements in all secondary 
      outcomes at T1, but all outcomes significantly declined at T2, except for anxiety 
      and stress. MBI participants were receptive toward the programme in all aspects 
      of personal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The tailored MBI is a potentially effective, 
      feasible and acceptable approach to facilitate personal recovery among people 
      with mental illness. Differences between MBI and RT are discussed.

TI  - A single-session VR intervention addressing self-compassion and self-criticism 
      with and without perspective change: Results of a randomized controlled 
      experiment.

AB  - Excessive self-criticism is an important transdiagnostic psychological factor. In 
      contrast, self-compassion can contribute to the resilience and recovery of 
      clinical populations, making this an important target for treatment. Virtual 
      Reality (VR) has the potential to improve existing interventions as it allows for 
      personalized roleplays that can be experienced from different perspectives, by 
      using the novel VR technique of perspective change. We investigated the effects 
      of a VR intervention on self-criticism and self-compassion, and the added value 
      of changing perspectives. In total, 68 undergraduate students with high levels of 
      self-criticism were randomized to either the perspective change condition or the 
      control condition. Participants played two roleplays in which they had to react 
      compassionately toward a virtual character that expressed the participants' own 
      self-critical thoughts. In the perspective change condition, after each roleplay 
      perspective change was used to receive one's own compassionate words. Results 
      showed that self-compassion increased and self-criticism decreased significantly 
      in both conditions. No significant differences were found for negative and 
      positive affect. Furthermore, no differences were found between the conditions. 
      Thus, receiving compassionate words through perspective change had no additional 
      effect. Expressing compassion to someone with similar self-criticism showed to be 
      sufficient to reduce self-criticism and increase self-compassion.

TI  - Effects of live-online, group mindfulness training on opioid use and anxiety 
      during buprenorphine treatment: A comparative effectiveness RCT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine has emerged as a 
      popular evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, 
      psychosocial stress, anxiety, pain, and co-morbid substance use increase 
      patients' risk for relapse. We designed this study to compare the effects of 
      complementing buprenorphine treatment with 24 weeks of a live-online Mindful 
      Recovery Opioid Care Continuum (M-ROCC) group to a time and attention-matched, 
      live-online Recovery Support Group (RSG) active control condition. METHODS: We 
      plan to enroll a maximum of N = 280 and randomize at least N = 192 patients 
      prescribed buprenorphine through referrals from office-based and telemedicine 
      buprenorphine treatment providers and social media advertisements. Participants 
      will be randomly assigned to M-ROCC or RSG and will be blinded to their treatment 
      condition. The primary outcome for this study will be biochemically confirmed 
      periods of abstinence from illicit opioids, as measured by self-reported use and 
      randomly collected, video-observed oral fluid toxicology testing during the final 
      12 weeks of study participation. Secondary outcomes include changes in 
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) anxiety and 
      pain interference scores between baseline and week 24. RESULTS: The trial was 
      funded by the National Institutes of Health, HEAL Initiative through NCCIH 
      (R33AT010125). Data collection is projected to end by September 2023, and we 
      expect publication of results in 2024. CONCLUSION: If the M-ROCC intervention is 
      found to be effective in this format, it will demonstrate that live-online 
      mindfulness groups can improve outcomes and address common co-morbidities like 
      anxiety and pain during buprenorphine treatment.

AB  - Sleep problems are prevalent among older adults, often persist untreated, and are 
      predictive of health detriments. Given the limitations of conventional 
      treatments, non-pharmacological treatments such as mindfulness-based 
      interventions (MBIs) are gaining popularity for sleep ailments. However, nothing 
      is yet known about the impact of MBIs on sleep in older adults with prodromal 
      sleep disturbances. This article details the design and methodology of a 6-week 
      parallel-group RCT calibrated to test the treatment effect of the Mindful 
      Awareness Practices (MAPs) program versus sleep hygiene education for improving 
      sleep quality, as the main outcome, in older adults with prodromal sleep 
      disturbances. Older adults with current sleep disturbances will be recruited from 
      the urban Los Angeles community. Participants will be randomized into two 
      standardized treatment conditions, MAPs and sleep hygiene education. Each 
      condition will consist of weekly 2-hour group-based classes over the course of 
      the 6-week intervention. The primary objective of this study is to determine if 
      mindfulness meditation practice as engaged through the MAPs program leads to 
      improved sleep quality relative to sleep hygiene education in older adults with 
      prodromal sleep disturbances.
