AB  - The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the impact of a mindful self-compassion intervention on burden, express emotion, and mental well-being in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. Standardized measures, including the ZARIT Caregiving Burden Scale, Expressed Emotion Scale and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, were administered at baseline, post-intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted to assess differences between the two groups. Significant reductions in caregiver burden, expressed emotion, and enhanced mental well-being in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention. The results of this randomized controlled trial indicate that the mindful self-compassion intervention significantly reduces caregiver burden, expressed emotion, and improves mental well-being in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. These findings underscore the potential utility of mindful self-compassion interventions as effective support for this population, highlighting the importance of integrating such interventions into caregiver support programs.

AB  - Introduction: Adolescents are experiencing high rates of depressive symptoms, with negative consequences to their long‐term health. Group‐based, mindful self‐compassion programs show promise in mitigating the development of more significant depression in at‐risk adolescents. However, the lack of well‐designed, active control conditions has limited the ability to examine the efficacy of such interventions. Methods: Fifty‐nine adolescents (Mage = 15.81, 70% female) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms from the Southeastern US were randomized to group‐based Mindful Self‐Compassion for Teens (N = 30) or a newly developed active control Healthy Lifestyles group (N = 29) during 2018 and 2019. Participants attended 8 weekly "main" sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. The feasibility and acceptability of participation in both groups were measured using attrition, attendance, credibility, and satisfaction data. Depression scores were collected weekly, and self‐compassion scores were collected five times across 36 weeks. Results: Both groups were equally feasible and acceptable during the 8‐week program period; however, monthly continuation sessions were poorly attended in both groups. The risk of developing clinically significant depression was 2.6 times higher in the control group compared with the self‐compassion group (p =.037) across 36 weeks. Depression significantly decreased in the self‐compassion group, while it significantly increased in the control group. Both groups increased significantly in reports of self‐compassion. These findings are on par with results noting the efficacy of cognitive‐based interventions for high‐risk adolescents; follow‐up studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to confirm these findings. Conclusions: Initial examination suggests Mindful Self‐Compassion for Teens programming is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in preventing the development of clinically significant depression in adolescents with subsyndromal depression. Future studies may benefit from refinements to the self‐compassion measurement and/or the attention control condition; moreover, larger sample sizes are needed to confirm results.

AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

AB  - Objective: The primary aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of a 'mindful eating' programme for reducing emotional eating in patients with overweight or obesity. Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial (reg. NCT03927534) was conducted with 76 participants with overweight/obesity who were assigned to 'mindful eating' (7 weeks) + treatment as usual (TAU), or to TAU alone. They were assessed at baseline, posttreatment and 12‐month follow‐up. The main outcome was 'emotional eating' (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, DEBQ); other eating behaviours were also assessed along with psychological and physiological variables. Results: 'Mindful eating' + TAU reduced emotional eating both at posttreatment (B = −0.27; p = 0.006; d = 0.35) and follow‐up (B = −0.53; p < 0.001; d = 0.69) compared to the control group (TAU alone). 'External eating' (DEBQ) was also significantly improved by the intervention at both timepoints. Significant effects at follow‐up were observed for some secondary outcomes related to bulimic behaviours, mindful eating, mindfulness, and self‐compassion. Weight and other physiological parameters were not significantly affected by 'mindful eating' + TAU. Conclusions: These findings support the efficacy of the 'mindful eating' + TAU programme for reducing emotional and external eating, along with some other secondary measures, but no significant changes in weight reduction were observed. Highlights: 'Mindful eating' added to treatment as usual (TAU) is more effective than TAU alone for reducing the emotional eating pattern of obese and overweight patients in primary care (PC) settings.The programme produced improvements in secondary outcomes such as external eating, the severity of bulimic symptoms, the frequency of binge episodes, and some mindfulness and self‐compassion facets.The body mass index (BMI) and other physiological variables were not significantly reduced by the 'Mindful eating' programme; future studies should try to overcome some methodological shortcomings of the present study.

AB  - Parents raising children with Learning Disabilities (LDs) often face multiple challenges and high levels of parenting stress, especially in societies with intense academic competitions. Mindful parenting (MP) is an emerging approach that brings mindful awareness to parent–child interactions and is found effective in reducing parenting stress in various parent populations. This study examined the effectivenesss of an 8-week online MP program on Chinese parents of children with LDs. A MP program was adapted and implemented in an online format with 69 parents of children with LDs. A randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the efficacy of the mindful parenting group compared with a wait-list control group. Parenting stress, mindful parenting and self-compassion were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Compared with the wait-list control group, the MP group participants showed decreased parenting stress (d = 0.62, p < 0.05), improved mindful parenting (d = 0.63, p < 0.05), and increased self-compassion (d = 0.61, p < 0.05). These findings support the effectiveness of an online MP intervention in reducing parenting stress and increasing mindful parenting and self-compassion among Chinese parents of children with LDs. The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, whereas the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects, particularly non-judgmental acceptance and compassion towards the child, are resistant to change. Future studies should explore strategies to enhance these attitudinal aspects and interpersonal processes of MP. • Mindful parenting (MP) program can reduce parenting stress, improve mindful parenting and enhance self-compassion in parents of children with learning disabilities. • Online MP interventions can provide comparable effectiveness to traditional formats for parents of children with clinical conditions. • The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, compared with the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects.

AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has been widely used in promoting mental health, with positive emotions as an important mechanism. The current study explored the impact of background music on the effects and difficulties of LKM practice. Two hundred participants were randomly divided into six groups, wherein LKM plus music with harmony only, LKM plus music with harmony and melody, and LKM without music were presented in a different order during the intermediate three days of a five-day LKM intervention. Participants reported three types of positive emotions (pro-social, low-arousal, and medium-arousal positive emotions) and the difficulties during meditation (lack of concentration and lack of pro-social attitudes) after each of three sessions. The results of MANOVA indicated that compared to the session without music, incorporating music could evoke more low-arousal positive emotions and pro-social positive emotions without altering the difficulties. However, the results did not reveal significant differences in the effects of music with harmony and music with harmony and melody on both emotions and difficulties. Additionally, practice effects may have influenced the generation of medium-arousal positive emotions and the difficulty of concentration, but the results were inconsistent across groups. Our findings suggest potential benefits for practitioners of LKM in incorporating music during the meditation process, and the directions for future research were further discussed.

AB  - Background: Trauma-related guilt and shame are crucial for the development and maintenance of PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). We developed an intervention combining cognitive techniques with loving-kindness meditations (C-METTA) that specifically target these emotions. C-METTA is an intervention of six weekly individual treatment sessions followed by a four-week practice phase. Objective: This study examined C-METTA in a proof-of-concept study within a randomized wait-list controlled trial. Method: We randomly assigned 32 trauma-exposed patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis to CMETTA or a wait-list condition (WL). Primary outcomes were clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (CAPS-5) and trauma-related guilt and shame. Secondary outcomes included psychopathology, self-criticism, well-being, and self-compassion. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention phase and after the practice phase. Results: Mixed-design analyses showed greater reductions in C-METTA versus WL in clinicianrated PTSD symptoms (d = −1.09), guilt (d = −2.85), shame (d = −2.14), psychopathology and self-criticism. Conclusion: Our findings support positive outcomes of C-METTA and might contribute to improved care for patients with stress-related disorders. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00023470). (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Antecedentes: La culpa y la vergüenza asociadas al trauma son críticas para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). Se desarrolló una intervención combinando técnicas cognitivas y meditaciones de bondad amorosa (C-METTA) que se enfoca específicamente en estas emociones. El C-METTA es una intervención semanal individual de seis semanas seguidas de una fase de práctica de cuatro semanas. Objetivo: El estudio evaluó el C-METTA mediante un estudio de prueba de concepto dentro de un ensayo clínico aleatorizado comparado con lista de espera. Métodos: Se asignó aleatoriamente a 32 pacientes expuestos a trauma que tuviesen algún diagnóstico según el DSM-5 al grupo C-METTA o a la lista de espera. Los resultados primarios fueron los síntomas asociados al TEPT evaluados por un clínico (CAPS-5, por sus siglas en inglés) y la culpa y vergüenza relacionadas a trauma. Los resultados secundarios fueron la psicopatología, la autocrítica, el bienestar y la autocompasión. Resultados: Los análisis de diseño mixto mostraron mayores reducciones en los síntomas asociados al TEPT evaluados por un clínico (d = −1.09), en la culpa (d = −2.85), la vergüenza (d = −2.14), la psicopatología y la autocrítica en el grupo C-METTA en comparación con el grupo control. Hubo un mayor incremento en la autocompasión con un tamaño del efecto grande. La culpa y la vergüenza se redujeron en la fase de intervención y este efecto se mantuvo estable durante la fase de práctica. Conclusión: Los hallazgos son consistentes con resultados positivos del C-METTA y podrían contribuir a mejorar el cuidado de los pacientes con trastornos relacionados con el estrés. El estudio fue registrado en el Registro Alemán de Ensayos Clínicos (DRKS00023470). (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Helping professionals are at risk of experiencing adverse health and psychological problems when working in roles where they are continually exposed to the emotional distress of others. The term compassion fatigue was coined to describe symptoms of emotional and physical fatigue experienced by workers in these environments. However, empirical research contends that compassion does not cause fatigue, rather compassion is said to foster well-being and is neurologically rejuvenating. The objective of this review was to examine the scientific literature which investigated the compassion-enhancing practice of loving kindness meditation (LKM). This review suggests that LKM can be seen as an alternate strategy to reduce stress, ease empathic distress, and increase positive affect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to identify moderators of treatment effect (i.e. depressive symptoms and well-being) of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI) in patients with bipolar disorder. Data were drawn from two multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating effectiveness of MBCT vs treatment as usual (TAU; n = 144) and PPI vs TAU (n = 97) in bipolar disorder. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 12 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using separate linear regression models, comparing the pooled MBCT or PPI outcomes to TAU, and comparing MBCT to PPI. The exploratory analyses not corrected for multiple comparisons showed a number of variables that were associated with stronger response to the interventions, including higher baseline anxiety, lower well-being, and lower levels of self-focused positive rumination, well-being, and self-compassion, and variables associated with a stronger response to either MBCT (higher levels of depression and anxiety and being married) or PPI (being male). After correcting for multiple testing, depressive symptoms appeared to be the most robust variable associated with better response to MBCT than PPI. The RCTs handled slightly different enrollment criteria and outcome measures. The most robust finding is that patients with more severe symptomatology seem to benefit more from MBCT than PPI. This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. However, before definite treatment assignment criteria can be formulated and implemented in clinical practice, these findings should be replicated. • This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. • Findings show that both MBCT and PPI are more helpful than TAU in improving well-being at 12-months after baseline. • Patients with more severe symptomatology benefit more from MBCT than PPI at posttreatment and 12 months after baseline.

AB  - Introduction: Parents of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) experience more stress than parents of typically developing children. In a cocreation process with experts and parents, a low-threshold application that uses exercises based on the principles of positive psychology and mindfulness was developed. This application, called "Adappt," aims at enhancing the ability to adapt of the parents and caregivers of children with NDDs and at supporting their mental health. This protocol describes the evaluation study of the effectiveness of Adappt, its core working mechanisms and user experiences. Method: A pragmatic international multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of Adappt with a (delayed) waitlist control condition. At least 212 parents or primary caregivers of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with or suspected of a NDD will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Participants are excluded if they have severe anxiety or depression levels or are in treatment for mental health issues. Measures will be collected online at baseline, post-intervention (1 month after baseline), and 4 and 7 months after baseline. The primary outcome is the improvement in generic sense of ability to adapt as measured with the Generic Sense of Ability to Adapt Scale (GSAAS; (Front Psychol 14:985408, 2023)) at 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are mental well-being, (parental) distress, and client satisfaction with "Adappt." Discussion: Results of this study will contribute to knowledge on the effectiveness of a low-threshold application for parents of children with a NDD in multiple countries. If the application is found to be effective in improving mental health, recommendations will be made for implementation in health care. Trial registration: This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06248762) on February 8, 2024, and the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/5znqv). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LKCM) are considered a promising practice for increasing long-term well-being. While previous studies have mainly focused on meditation practice quantity, the current study provides an initial exploration of the quality of meditation during multiweek LKCM training. Data were collected through offline (Study 1; N = 41) and online (Study 2; N = 243) LKCM interventions. Quality of meditation was measured using two kinds of difficulties experienced during LKCM each week/unit (i.e., difficulty in concentration and difficulty in generating prosocial attitudes). Subjective well-being (SWB) was assessed by life satisfaction before and after training as well as positive and negative emotions each week/unit. Two studies consistently suggested that meditation quality was significantly associated with changes in SWB. Study 1 even showed that quality had a stronger association with SWB than did meditation quantity. Moreover, both short-term (measured each week/unit) and long-term (measured across the entire training period) associations between the quality of meditation and SWB were significant. Focusing on meditation quality, our findings provide theoretical and methodological pathways for understanding the contribution of meditation practice to LKCM training, which is helpful for guiding future research and best practices.

AB  - Background: Previous research has proposed that there may be potential synergies between psychedelic and meditation interventions, but there are still knowledge gaps that merit further investigation. Methods: Using a longitudinal observational research design with samples representative of the US and UK adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 9732), we investigated potential associations between self-reported psychedelic use and meditation practice. Results: The follow-up survey was completed by 7667 respondents (79% retention rate), with 100 respondents reporting psychedelic use during the 2-month study period (1.3% of follow-up respondents). In covariate-adjusted regression models, psychedelic use during the study period was associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.40, p = 0.004). Among those who reported psychedelic use during the study period, covariate-adjusted regression models revealed that the subjective experience of insight during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in that period was also associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness and loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.42, p = 0.021; B = 0.38, p = 0.017). Notably, more days of loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week at baseline was associated with less severe subjective feelings of death or dying during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in the study period (B = −0.29, p = 0.037). Conclusions: Psychedelic use might lead to greater engagement with meditation practices such as mindfulness meditation, while meditation practices such as loving-kindness or compassion medication might buffer against certain challenging experiences associated with psychedelic use.

AB  - This is a conceptual overview of a premeeting institute (PMI) I presented at the 39th International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) annual meeting in November 2023 entitled, "A Functional Approach to Repairing Moral Injury and Traumatic Loss in Context: Evidence, Change Agents, Clinical Strategies, and Lessons Learned." This paper was invited by the co‐chairs of the Scientific Program Committee, Isaac Galatzer‐Levy and Katharina Schultebraucks. I first describe the aims of the PMI and then summarize the foundational assumptions that led me to expand adaptive disclosure and create adaptive disclosure–enhanced (AD‐E). The foundational assumptions are that (a) moral injury is a unique measurable potential clinical problem, (b) moral injury damages the sustaining building blocks to personal and collective humanity, and (c) repairing moral injury requires corrective humanizing and virtuous experiences and connections. I then provide an overview of AD‐E and describe two new change agents— loving–kindness meditation and letter writing—that augment the original AD in service of promoting corrective experiences in the social world that are valued, valuing, and promote the experience of belonging.

AB  - <bold>Objectives: </bold>The purpose of this study was to conduct the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention (SG-MBI) for treating fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Compared to first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, SG-MBIs are more acknowledging of the spiritual aspect of mindfulness.<bold>Design: </bold>A RCT employing intent-to-treat analysis.<bold>Methods: </bold>Adults with FMS received an 8-week SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (MAT; n = 74) or an active control intervention known as cognitive behaviour theory for groups (n = 74). Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up phases.<bold>Results: </bold>Meditation awareness training participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control group participants in FMS symptomatology, pain perception, sleep quality, psychological distress, non-attachment (to self, symptoms, and environment), and civic engagement. A mediation analysis found that (1) civic engagement partially mediated treatment effects for all outcome variables, (2) non-attachment partially mediated treatment effects for psychological distress and sleep quality, and (3) non-attachment almost fully mediated treatment effects for FMS symptomatology and pain perception. Average daily time spent in meditation was found to be a significant predictor of changes in all outcome variables.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Meditation awareness training may be a suitable treatment for adults with FMS and appears to ameliorate FMS symptomatology and pain perception by reducing attachment to self. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Designing interventions to treat fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) continues to be a challenge. There is growing interest into the applications of mindfulness-based interventions for treating FMS. Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) are a key new direction in mindfulness research. What does this study add? Meditation awareness training - an SG-MBI - resulted in significant reductions in FMS symptomatology. SG-MBIs recognize the spiritual aspect of mindfulness and may have a role in the treatment of FMS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ObjectivesMethodsResultsConclusionsClinical ImplicationsThis pilot study assessed the feasibility of a group-based telephone-delivered meditation intervention to reduce social isolation in older adults. It included weekly training sessions and daily practices of loving-kindness meditation in small groups via telephone conferences for six weeks and an extended group meditation practice for another six weeks.Community-living older adults (age 60+) with multiple chronic conditions and experiencing social isolation were recruited. Each participant was assessed at the pretest, posttest, and follow-up (6 and 12 weeks after pretest). Outcome measures included social interaction, loneliness, and depressive symptoms. Open-ended questions were asked in the posttest and follow-up.Sixteen individuals enrolled, and fourteen completed the program (87.5% retention). Completers showed high levels of adherence (95% attendance to training) and acceptability and a statistically significant increase in social interaction at follow-up. Qualitative data suggest that participants experienced changes in emotion regulation, motivation and confidence, and sense of belonging.A group-based telephone-delivered meditation intervention targeting chronically ill older adults who experience social isolation is technically feasible, very acceptable, and potentially beneficial to them.Older adults enjoy learning meditation. Telephone conferencing is a low-cost tool for engaging socially isolated older adults in social interactions and group meditation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Many loving-kindness and compassion meditation methods used in psychological research are derived from Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Zhiyi (智顗), a representative figure of Chinese Buddhism, proposed a different meditation method, namely, imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation. The current article introduces the imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation proposed by Zhiyi and compares it with meditation methods from Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Zhiyi's method limits the content of imagination during meditation, which can be an essential supplement to the free association method derived from Theravada Buddhism. Zhiyi's method of helping others entirely through imagination differs significantly from the tonglen method derived from Tibetan Buddhism and may be more suitable for participants without religious beliefs. Based on Zhiyi's source text and previous psychological studies, a mental-health training program for imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation is proposed. The limitations of Zhiyi's method and the future directions for empirical research on Zhiyi's method are also discussed. The differences between Zhiyi's method and other methods in terms of effects and applicable populations need to be examined in future studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Wanting to help others and benefit society in one's future career are examples of communal career goals. Raising these goals in youth should increase interest in HEED‐occupations (Healthcare, Early Education, Domestic, and the Domestic fields) which are strongly gender‐skewed and face labor shortage. Research has yet to find ways to increase communal career goals. In this study, we test the novel hypothesis that after listening to a brief loving‐kindness meditation, participants will rate stronger communal career goals, as compared to controls. In three experimental studies, volunteering high‐school students (Study 1 and 3) and university students (Study 2) listened to a 12‐min recording of the meditation with the explicit purpose of investigating its effect on stress. They thereafter filled out an apparently unrelated career goal survey. We compared the results with a control group that just rated the career goals (Studies 1–3) and a control group that listened to calm music before filling out the survey (Study 2 and 3). The results showed that the high‐school students rated higher communal career goals after listening to the meditation, as compared to controls. We did not replicate the result in the sample of university students, which could relate to adults having less flexible career goals than youth, or to a ceiling effect in communal goals. This is the first study that has demonstrated a method with the potential of increasing communal career goals in youth. In addition to increasing interest in HEED, raising communal goals could benefit society, since they are intrinsically prosocial. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background:  Nurses vicariously exposed to the suffering of those in their care are at risk of compassion fatigue. Emerging research suggests that self-compassion interventions may provide protective factors and enhance resilience. This pilot study examined the effect of an eight-week Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training intervention on nurses’ compassion fatigue and resilience and participants’ lived experience of the effect of the training. Methods:  This observational mixed research pilot study adopted an evaluation design framework. It comprised of a single group and evaluated the effects of a pilot MSC intervention by analyzing the pre- and post-change scores in self-compassion, mindfulness, secondary trauma, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and resilience. The sample of the nurses’ (N = 13) written responses to the question, “How did you experience the effect of this pilot MSC training?” were also analyzed. Results:  The Pre- to Post- scores of secondary trauma and burnout declined significantly and were negatively associated with self-compassion (r = -.62, p = .02) (r = -.55, p = .05) and mindfulness (r = -.54, p = .05). (r = -.60, p = .03), respectively. Resilience and compassion satisfaction scores increased. All variables demonstrated a large effect size: Mean (M) Cohen’s d = 1.23. The qualitative emergent themes corroborated the quantitative findings and expanded the understanding about how MSC on the job practices enhanced nurses’ coping. Conclusion:  This is the first study to examine the effect of a pilot (MSC) training program on nurses’ compassion fatigue and resilience in this new area of research. It provides some preliminary empirical evidence in support of the theorized benefits of self-compassion training for nurses. However, further research, such as a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with a larger sample size and a longitudinal study, is required to see if the benefits of self-compassion training are sustainable.

AB  - Loving‐kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) have been well applied among employees to improve their health and well‐being. Existing studies on LKCM have also provided supportive evidence of its benefits and effectiveness under organizational contexts. The current meta‐analytical study aimed to systematically summarise the effects of LKCM in the workplace and to outline directions for future research and practice. Among 327 empirical studies on LKCM published until March 2022, 21 trials focussed on employees and provided sufficient information, which were included in the following meta‐analysis. The results showed that LKCM benefited eight categories of workplace outcomes. Specifically, LKCM effectively decreased employees' burnout (g = 0.395, k = 10) and stress (g = 0.544, k = 10) and facilitated their mindfulness (g = 0.558, k = 14), self‐compassion (g = 0.646, k = 12), personal mental health (g = 0.308, k = 13), job attitudes (g = 0.283, k = 4), interpersonal relationships (g = 0.381, k = 12), and psychological resources (g = 0.406, k = 6). The results of moderation analyses further indicated that the participants' job type, gender, and the focus of LKCM might differentially fluctuate the magnitude of LKCM effects. To advance research and best practice, we finally pointed out several issues that deserve attention, such as long‐term effects, underlying mechanisms, potential moderators, and outcomes or influential factors at the organizational level.

AB  - Objective: Understanding the relevance of religion or spirituality (R/S) in the treatment of mental disorders is central to clinical and academic psychiatry. In this secondary analysis, associations of R/S with depression were investigated with respect to a new second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, the Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program. Methods: Different aspects of spirituality, spiritual coping, and spiritual engagement were assessed in 81 patients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate depression. Treatment effects on R/S postscores and predictor and moderation effects of depression severity and stress change-scores were evaluated at 8 weeks (MBLM vs. CONTROL [drug continuation therapy] vs. TAU [inpatient treatment as usual]) and 6 months (TAU+MBLM vs. TAU). Results: At both time points, significant differences between MBLM versus TAU and CONTROL were found in a range of spiritual outcomes, most of them with a medium-to-large effect size and in favor of MBLM. Baseline interest in spirituality (p = 0.001) and baseline spiritual mind–body practice (p = 0.017) were identified as independent predictors of change in depression severity at 6 months. Moreover, moderation analyses found that patients reporting often/regular spiritual mind–body practice at 6 months did not benefit differently from TAU+MBLM versus TAU (p = 0.437) regarding their change in depression severity and stress, while those reporting no/seldom spiritual mind–body practice at 6 months benefited significantly worse from TAU than from TAU+MBLM (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Participation in the MBLM program resulted in significantly greater increases in spirituality in depressed patients than standard therapy. Interest in spirituality and engagement in spiritual mind–body practices at baseline were positive predictors of clinical outcome in both groups. Patients of any group who regularly performed spiritual mind–body practices benefited equally in terms of antidepressant outcomes, underlining the benefit of these practices within a general therapeutic framework.

Greater self-compassion predicts better mental and physical health in both healthy and chronically ill populations. Thus, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the effects of self-compassion training on mood and metabolic outcomes among patients with diabetes.<bold>Research Design and Methods: </bold>This RCT tested the effects of a standardized 8-week mindful self-compassion (MSC) program (n = 32) relative to a wait-list control condition (n = 31) among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Measures of self-compassion, depressive symptoms, diabetes-specific distress, and HbA1c were taken at baseline (preintervention), at week 8 (postintervention), and at 3-month follow-up.<bold>Results: </bold>Repeated-measures ANOVA using intention to treat showed that MSC training increased self-compassion and produced statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression and diabetes distress in the intervention group, with results maintained at 3-month follow-up. MSC participants also averaged a clinically and statistically meaningful decrease in HbA1c between baseline and follow-up of >10 mmol/mol (nearly 1%). There were no overall changes for the wait-list control group.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This initial report suggests that learning to be kinder to oneself (rather than being harshly self-critical) may have both emotional and metabolic benefits among patients with diabetes.

AB  - Objective: This is a randomized controlled trial (NCT03056157) of an enhanced adaptive disclosure (AD) psychotherapy compared to present-centered therapy (PCT; each 12 sessions) in 174 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to traumatic loss (TL) and moral injury (MI). AD employs different strategies for different trauma types. AD-Enhanced (AD-E) uses letter writing (e.g., to the deceased), loving-kindness meditation, and bolstered homework to facilitate improved functioning to repair TL and MI-related trauma. Method: The primary outcomes were the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), evaluated at baseline, throughout treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning was also administered), the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), the Dimensions of Anger Reactions, the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale, and the Quick Drinking Screen. Results: There were statistically significant between-group differences on two outcomes: The intent-to-treat (ITT) mixed-model analysis of SDS scores indicated greater improvement from baseline to posttreatment in the AD-E group (d = 2.97) compared to the PCT group, d = 1.86; −2.36, 95% CI [−3.92, −0.77], t(1,510) = −2.92, p <.001, d = 0.15. Twenty-one percent more AD-E cases made clinically significant changes on the SDS than PCT cases. From baseline to posttreatment, AD-E was also more efficacious on the CAPS-5 (d = 0.39). These differential effects did not persist at follow-up intervals. Conclusion: This was the first psychotherapy of veterans with TL/MI-related PTSD to show superiority relative to PCT with respect to functioning and PTSD, although the differential effect sizes were small to medium and not maintained at follow-up. What is the public health significance of this article?: Warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly multifarious clinical problem, partly because combat trauma can entail extensive traumatic loss and moral injury, either from personal transgressive acts or bearing witness to or being victimized by others' transgressions. Adaptive disclosure (AD) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that was designed to help service members and veterans with war-related PTSD. We applied lessons learned from previous research on AD and enhanced AD to better help war veterans with loss- and moral-injury-related PTSD. We compared the enhanced AD (AD-E) with present-centered therapy (PCT) in a clinical trial of 174 veterans with PTSD. We found AD-E to be superior to PCT with respect to helping veterans function better and in terms of reducing PTSD symptom burden. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and aim: Head and neck cancer patients are vulnerable to various psychological complications due to the effects of both cancer itself and cancer treatment on patients' appearance and physical well-being. Nevertheless, few data have been obtained on effective psychosocial interventions that could protect this group of cancer patients' psychological well-being. Therefore, this three-armed, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) aims to evaluate and compare the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive psychology (such as posttraumatic growth [PTG], hope, and optimism), quality of life (QoL), and psychological complications (depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance) among newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients. Methods and analysis: This RCT will target newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been treated only with surgery or who have not yet received any treatment. In total, 120 patients who meet all of the study's inclusion criteria and none of its exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into three groups—an ACT group, an MBSR group, and a treatment-as-usual control group—at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in the two intervention groups (the ACT and MBSR groups) will undergo an eight-week group intervention program. During this program, each intervention will comprise eight modules based on ACT and MBSR, respectively. Outcome assessments will be performed across a three-point timeline, including before the intervention (t0), immediately after the psychosocial intervention at eight weeks (t1), and six months after the intervention (t2). The primary outcome that will be assessed during this RCT is PTG. Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes that will be evaluated in this study are such as QoL, hope, optimism, depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance. Trial registration number: NCT04800419 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Registered on March 16, 2021. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: Depression is a global key challenge in mental health care. The implementation of effective, low‐risk and cost‐effective interventions to reduce its disease burden is a necessity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the new Meditation‐Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program, a "second‐generation" mindfulness‐based intervention, in depressive outpatients. Methods: Eighty‐one patients with mild to moderate depression were randomized into three groups: intervention group (MBLM), control group (CONTROL), and treatment as usual group (TAU). The primary outcome was the change of depressive symptoms as administered by the Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) after 4 and 8 weeks. Secondary outcome variables included the Brief Symptom Checklist‐18 and the Perceived Stress Scale‐10. A 6‐month follow‐up was conducted. Results: A greater reduction of depressive symptoms was found in MBLM participants compared to CONTROL (p <.001, ηp2 = 0.11, d = 0.70) and TAU (p<.001,ηp2=0.10,d=0.67 $p\lt.001,{\eta }_{{\rm{p}}}^{2}=0.10,d=0.67$) with a 13.15 points reduction of BDI‐II score versus 1.71 points (CONTROL) and 3.34 points (TAU) after 8 weeks. Between‐group post hoc tests for all secondary outcomes and at follow‐up also yielded significant between‐group differences with medium to large effect sizes in favor of MBLM. Conclusions: Study results showed beneficial effects of MBLM in depressed outpatients. Further high‐quality controlled clinical studies including qualitative research are needed to investigate the specific and unspecific effects of the MBLM program in depression and other medical conditions.

AB  - Our understanding of the emotions elicited by loving‐kindness meditation (LKM) at early stages of practice is limited, despite the influence that these emotions may have on later engagement. Past work suggests that LKM may elicit emotional ambivalence at early stages of the practice, but it is still unclear whether the content of LKM activates this ambivalence and who is more likely to experience it. Given the specific content of LKM, we defend that this meditation is likely to elicit empathetic emotions, both positive (compassion and gratitude) and negative (guilt), to a greater extent than an active control. Guilt is likely to be elicited by memories of incidents where naïve meditators were not able to experience compassion and/or by the difficulties in sending compassionate love to disliked others during the meditation. Furthermore, individuals with greater self‐discrepancy and lower self‐esteem are more likely to experience guilt. These hypotheses were tested in two experimental studies with community and student samples (n = 55 and n = 33, respectively) and using a brief intervention. The results support the hypotheses. These findings have implications for instructors of LKM, especially when organizing meditation practices with naïve meditators who should be aware of the potential negative emotions elicited by this meditation.

AB  - This work represents one of the first attempts to examine the effects of meditation on the processing of written single words. In the present longitudinal study, participants conducted a lexical decision task and rated the affective valence of nouns before and after a 7-week class in mindfulness meditation, loving-kindness meditation, or a control intervention. Both meditation groups rated the emotional valence of nouns more neutral after the interventions, suggesting a general down-regulation of emotions. In the loving-kindness group, positive words were rated more positively after the intervention, suggesting a specific intensification of positive feelings. After both meditation interventions, response times in the lexical decision task accelerated significantly, with the largest facilitation occurring in the loving-kindness group. We assume that meditation might have led to increased attention, better visual discrimination, a broadened attentional focus, and reduced mind-wandering, which in turn enabled accelerated word recognition. These results extend findings from a previous study with expert Zen meditators, in which we found that one session of advanced meditation can affect word recognition in a very similar way.

AB  - Purpose Over the last 10-15 years, there has been a substantive increase in compassion-based interventions aiming to improve psychological functioning and well-being. Methods This study provides an overview and synthesis of the currently available compassion-based interventions. What do these programmes looks like, what are their aims, and what is the state of evidence underpinning each of them? Results This overview has found at least eight different compassion-based interventions (e.g., Compassion-Focused Therapy, Mindful Self-Compassion, Cultivating Compassion Training, Cognitively Based Compassion Training), with six having been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, and with a recent meta-analysis finding that compassion-based interventions produce moderate effect sizes for suffering and improved life satisfaction. Conclusions Although further research is warranted, the current state of evidence highlights the potential benefits of compassion-based interventions on a range of outcomes that clinicians can use in clinical practice with clients. Practitioner points There are eight established compassion intervention programmes with six having RCT evidence., The most evaluated intervention to date is compassion-focused therapy., Further RCTs are needed in clinical populations for all compassion interventions., Ten recommendations are provided to improve the evidence-base of compassion interventions.

AB  - Buddhism is an ancient religion and philosophy of living that is practised worldwide. More recent interest in mindfulness as a practice and intervention in the West has highlighted Buddhist-derived concepts as useful in supporting health and well-being. As a result, the desire to understand Buddhism in its more complete form has strengthened. Although research into mindfulness and compassion is growing, there is a new interest in second-generation mindfulness, i.e. interventions that draw upon a more holistic use of Buddhist practices. To date, little research has explored this in Western contexts. For the current study, Nichiren Buddhists from the United Kingdom who had been practising for at least three years were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore their experience of this practice and how it informed their approach to daily life and, in particular, their health and well-being. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was employed as a method to understand the participants' experiences. Three themes were generated using an inductive approach: (1) finding meaning—"All experiences have got so much value now"— which reflected the participants' determination to seek purpose and value in all aspects of their life; (2) Buddhism as a needed 'tool'—"I use it all the time"—which revealed their practice as an important method to help them manage their lives; and (3) agency—"I'm in control of my destiny"—which highlighted the participants' engagement (supported by their Buddhist practice) in taking responsibility for their actions and responses. Findings indicate the need for future studies to further explore Buddhism as a mechanism for enhancing and sustaining well-being. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mindful breathing meditation (MBM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) are common components of effective mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). This study examined the differential effects of MBM and LKM on purported therapeutic process variables and mental health outcomes via component analysis. The research design was a randomized controlled trial with four conditions: MBM, LKM, combined (MBM + LKM), and a relaxation control. All conditions consisted of 10-min. audio-recorded guided meditations that were self-implemented over the course of two weeks. Participants were college undergraduates (N = 52). Findings indicated statistically significant and very large main effects of time, regardless of condition. Statistically significant time by condition interactions were only observed for one process variable (i.e., defusion) and one mental health outcome (i.e., depression). Follow-up descriptive evaluation of between-group effect sizes indicated patterns of favorable effects for MBM and LKM over the combined and relaxation control conditions. Treatment integrity and treatment acceptability data indicated very favorable social validity across conditions. We conclude that our findings make a modest yet value-added contribution to the MBI component analysis literature, suggesting differentiated performance among isolated MBM and LKM exercises compared to combined and control conditions. Yet further research is warranted to improve upon the limitations of this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives: Infertility is a prominent problem affecting millions of couples worldwide. Recently, there has been a hightened emphasis on elucidating the subtle linkages between infertility treatment leveraging assisted reproductive technology and the complex realm of psychological challenges, as well as efforts in implementation of psychological interventions.The Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program seeks to improve self-compassion, compassion for others, mindfulness, and life satisfaction while reducing depression, anxiety, and stress. In the current study, an MSC intervention was performed on infertile women (IW) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms and enhancing life expectancy. Methods: Fifty-seven IW undergoing IVF were randomly allocated to two groups: MSC (n = 29) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 28). Participants in MSC met once a week for two hours for eight weeks and attended a half-day meditation retreat. The Synder's Hope questionnaire and the Revised 90-Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used as the primary outcome measures. Data were obtained before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and two months post-intervention. Repeated measures of ANCOVA and paired t-tests in all assessment points were used to compare the MSC and the TAU groups in outcomes. Results: In the MSC group, hopelessness, anger-hostility, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity difficulties, and depression were significantly reduced compared with the TAU group, and those improvements persisted at the two-month follow-up. Reliable change index revealed that the MSC group's gains were both clinically significant and durable. Conclusions: MSC can facilitate higher life satisfaction and mental well-being for IW undergoing IVF by reducing psychological distress, psychopathological symptoms, and hopelessness. These encouraging findings call for more research into the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies in addressing psychological problems among IW undergoing IVF.

AB  - Mindfulness and self-compassion are reported to have a preventive effects on depression and anxiety disorders. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of mindful self-compassion intervention on preventing postpartum depression in a group of symptomatic pregnant women. Participants were screened and assigned to the intervention and control groups randomly. A 6-week Internet-based Mindful Self-Compassion Program was used to train the participants. Multiple scales were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, mindfulness, self-compassion, and mother and infant well-being. All assessments were performed at three time points: baseline, 3 months, and 1 year postpartum. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in depressive and anxiety behaviors. In addition, the intervention group became more mindful and self-compassionate at 3 months and 1 year postpartum. More importantly, both mothers and infants experienced substantial improvement in well-being. Our findings indicate that mindful self-compassion intervention is effective in preventing postpartum depression and promoting mother and infant well-being. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Many studies have examined the effect of meditation sessions led by experienced teachers on personal benefits for adults. The present study investigated the effect of broad-based mindfulness practices with an adolescent peer facilitator on prosocial outcomes in addition to individual gains. The 20 study participants were classified into a nonintervention group that received no treatment and an intervention group that joined a meditation club at a large public high school where they received instruction on breath meditation, compassion meditation, and loving–kindness meditation. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests indicated statistically significant increases in pre–post difference scores for Well-Being, Empathy, Compassion, and Prosocial Peer Attitudes and Behaviors in the intervention group compared to the nonintervention group. No differences were found for Mindful Awareness, Social Connectedness, and Affect. Approximately 68% of the variance in Compassion was accounted for by Well-Being and absence of COVID-19 exposure. After 10 weeks, participants self-reported that they definitively (60%) or likely (40%) benefited from the intervention. Peer-run mindfulness clubs in schools represent a promising strategy for adolescents to manage personal well-being and become agents for enhancing peer relations and school culture through the cultivation of empathy and compassion.

AB  - Over the past decade research has increased on dynamics between mindfulness, positive affect, and pain. While there have been studies examining the direct use of positive psychology for pain management, few have examined the use of a specific mindfulness-enhanced positive affect induction (i.e. a singular brief technique engendering mindfulness and strong positive affect) toward acute pain and pain flare management. This topical commentary discusses the need for such a technique toward bolstered gold-standard interventions, related studies, and possible future directions for acute and post-surgical pain management. Future research is encouraged to build from prior research on loving-kindness meditation and examine novel, brief mindfulness-enhanced positive affect inductions for acute pain management.

AB  - College students are experiencing heightened mental health difficulties, with problems intensifying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a group intervention focused on cultivating mindfulness skills, with demonstrated efficacy in reducing psychopathology and bolstering mental health. This pilot randomized trial assessed the feasibility, engagement, and efficacy of an online adaptation of MBSR among healthy college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were randomly allocated to either an adapted MBSR group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 10). Participants completed mental health questionnaires prior to, and following the intervention. The intervention was demonstrated to be feasible and participants were engaged. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction participants reported greater increases over time in mindful self-compassion and observing mindfulness compared to control participants. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction participants demonstrated marginally greater overall mindfulness and well-being over time. This study identified small, clinically meaningful mental health effects of an online adaptation of MBSR among college students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In a world often characterized by stress, anxiety, and disconnection, the ancient practices of loving-kindness (metta) and compassion (karuna) meditation offer solace and renewal. For centuries, these profound techniques have been integral to Buddhist traditions, fostering qualities of acceptance, empathy, and interconnectedness. In recent years, there has been a growing interest from western psychologists and scientific researchers on the significance of these time-honored practices. However, many of these empirical studies do not specifically focus on the origins of loving-kindness and compassion meditations. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that these practices have deep roots in Buddhist traditions and teachings and have been widely utilized and refined within the framework of this ancient tradition for centuries. Their attention and incorporation into contemporary psychological interventions reflect a growing recognition of the wisdom and efficacy of these practices. This commentary article aims to explore the psychological and interpersonal benefits of loving-kindness and compassion meditations, highlighting their transformative potential for individuals seeking emotional well-being.

AB  - Objectives: Loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LKCM) is an important practice to cultivate self-compassion. This study provides the first systematic review for the effects of LKCM interventions on self-compassion. Method: Inclusion criteria required studies were published in English, focused on LKCM interventions and measured self-compassion scale as outcomes. Literature search was conducted on March 3, 2022, by searching PsycInfo, Web of Science Core Collection, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Risk of bias was evaluated following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions. Effect sizes were analyzed with random-effects model. The subgroup analyses are conducted against the categorical moderators and meta-regressions against the continuous ones. A narrative review was recruited to deepen the understanding of the primary outcomes. Results: Meta-analyses included 65 studies and participants involved adults across healthy and clinical samples. The results showed that LKCM interventions effectively cultivate self-compassion (d = 0.56, k = 31, n = 2,823 for randomized controlled trials; d = 0.69, k = 24, n = 1,188 for uncontrolled trials). The effect sizes were significantly impacted by control conditions, participant type, focus of LKCM, and specific protocols. Effect sizes also showed nonsignificant but large variations across six dimensions of self-compassion. Discussion: LKCM interventions could effectively cultivate self-compassion among adults across healthy and clinical samples, but more studies are required to generalize effects to specific clinical samples and adolescents.

AB  - This study supported interventions based on loving-kindness and compassion meditations can effectively cultivate self-compassion. The effects and the best dose of meditation are impacted by health conditions of practitioners and whether the prosocial attitudes in meditations focus on the self or others.

AB  - Objectives The aim of these two studies was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program, an 8-week workshop designed to train people to be more self-compassionate. Methods Study 1 was a pilot study that examined change scores in self-compassion, mindfulness, and various wellbeing outcomes among community adults ( N = 21; mean [ M] age = 51.26 , 95% female). Study 2 was a randomized controlled trial that compared a treatment group (N = 25; M age = 51.21; 78% female) with a waitlist control group (N = 27; M age = 49.11; 82% female). Results Study 1 found significant pre/post gains in self-compassion, mindfulness, and various wellbeing outcomes. Study 2 found that compared with the control group, intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, and wellbeing. Gains were maintained at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Conclusions The MSC program appears to be effective at enhancing self-compassion, mindfulness, and wellbeing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with recurrent depression, but relapse rates remain high. To further improve outcome for this group of patients, follow-up interventions may be needed. Compassion training focuses explicitly on developing self-compassion, one of the putative working mechanisms of MBCT. No previous research has been done on the effectiveness of compassion training following MBCT in patients with recurrent depression. Aims To investigate the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living (MBCL) in reducing (residual) depressive symptoms in patients with recurrent depression who previously participated in MBCT. Methods/design A randomized controlled trial comparing MBCL in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only, in patients suffering from recurrent depressive episodes who completed an MBCT course in the past. Assessments will take place at baseline, post-treatment and at six months follow-up. After the control period, patients randomized to the TAU condition will be offered MBCL as well. Outcome measures Primary outcome measure is severity of depressive symptoms according to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures are presence or absence of DSM-IV depressive disorder, rumination, self-compassion, mindfulness skills, positive affect, quality of life, experiential avoidance and fear of self-compassion. Discussion Our study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of compassion training following MBCT in a recurrently depressed population. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02059200, registered 30 January 2014. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) becomes one of the diseases that greatly increased in the older adult population. Family caregivers play an important role in caring for family members who suffer from AD. The aim of this study was to illuminate the meaning of family caregivers’ lived experiences caring for a family member with AD from the perspective of an Indonesian. Methods: Narrative interviews were conducted with 13 family caregivers. These interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Results: The findings are presented under two main themes: Descent and ascent in caring for which emerged from category from being denial to acceptance, from lack of patience to compassion, from using to not using medication, and desperate yet responsibility. Another theme, caregivers’ life learning emerged from the category of ongoing caring for and getting through in caring for. Conclusion: Expressed concerns have shown that family caregivers not only face challenges in caring for family members suffering from AD, but also gain a lesson for life. It is necessary for family caregivers to manage caring processes for family members who suffer from AD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is a mass traumatic event that has universally and indiscriminately negatively affected the world. The adverse consequences of the pandemic have globally impacted psychological health and well-being via increased stressors, such as uncertainty, health anxieties, and financial instability. During the initial months of the pandemic, we (Polizzi et al., 2020) identified coping strategies that may be well-suited to address the sequelae of the pandemic. These strategies included behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, and loving-kindness meditation. We argued that these coping skills may foster resilience and recovery during the pandemic by generating a sense of social connection, encouraging meaning-making, and enhancing feelings of control amid uncertainty. Three years later, we update our initial suggestions by providing a narrative review that considers empirical evidence collected during the pandemic to support the utility of the previously identified coping strategies as well as additional strategies. We also discuss cross-cultural similarities and differences among these strategies and how research supports their application across diverse countries and groups. Finally, we conclude by synthesizing the literature within a regulatory flexibility framework that emphasizes flexible skill implementation with respect to sensitivity to context, coping repertoires, and feedback from the environment.

AB  - This project investigated same-day and lagged (i.e., from one day to the next) associations between daily positive affect and three distinct positive health behaviours: physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and meditation. Cross-day analyses also examined the role of positive affect felt during the targeted health behaviours. Secondary data analyses used a 9-week daily diary study in which midlife adults (N = 217) were randomized to learn one of two contemplative practices (i.e., mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation) while reporting nightly on their emotions and health behaviours. Results of same-day analyses revealed positive associations, both between-person and within-person, for the three positive health behaviours with daily positive affect. Results of lagged analyses revealed that positive affect experienced during fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day fruit and vegetable intake, and that fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day positive affect. The observed same-day relations between daily positive affect and engagement in positive health behaviours illuminate one path through which positive affect may contribute to health. The observed cross-day relations reveal a need for interdisciplinary research on mechanisms through which fruit and vegetable intake may shape next-day positive affect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article explores what truth-telling might look like in dialogue with clients around psychiatric medication, especially as it relates to the chemical imbalance metaphor and data about drug effectiveness. Discussions of these matters with clients should be centered in open critical dialogue that acknowledges complexity and uncertainty. It is proposed that providers be more explicit, straightforward, and truthful with clients. Specifically, providers should explain that, for some people, the alterations produced by psychiatric medications are desirable, helpful, and even life-saving. For others, however, that same drug can produce effects that are undesirable, intolerable, or even quite harmful physically or behaviorally. Providers can affirm, with compassion and hope, positive outcomes with medication and convey heartfelt understanding and empathy with negative outcomes. Embracing a contemporary truth-telling mode of communication will require professional courage in resisting the forces that perpetuate the illusion of clarity around the etiology and treatment of mental and emotional challenges, as well as professional humility to accept these limits to knowledge and the ability to give complete answers to all client questions.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated the analgesic effects of a single session of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) relative to a control. A total of 100 adults with chronic or current problematic pain completed a survey and were randomized to a 20-minute MM, LKM, or audiobook control. Co-primary outcomes of pain intensity and unpleasantness and mediators of mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed pre- and posttraining. Expectancies were assessed pretraining. Pain type (chronic vs current problematic) was a covariate. Relative to the control, higher expectancies were reported for MM and LKM (<italic>P</italic> < .001). MM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.41, <italic>P</italic> = .032) and LKM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.38, <italic>P</italic> = .027) had medium effects on pain intensity, with greater decreases than control (<italic>d</italic> = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> = .768). All conditions had small effects on unpleasantness. Mindful observing increased more within MM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.52, <italic>P</italic> = .022) and the control (<italic>d</italic> = 0.50, <italic>P</italic> = .011) than LKM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.12, <italic>P</italic> = .50); self-compassion increased more in LKM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.36, <italic>P</italic> = .042) than MM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.27, <italic>P</italic> = .201) and the control (<italic>d</italic> = 0.22, <italic>P</italic> = .249). The mediation models were nonsignificant. Pain type was a nonsignificant covariate. Overall, MM and LKM were associated with positive expectancies and small-medium pain intensity reductions, which did not differ by pain type. Although MM and LKM were associated with changes in theorized mediators, these changes did not underlie improvement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Loving-kindness meditations (LKM) have not been examined within a parenting context, which is surprising given that LKM helps to build social relationships and connectedness through promoting caring pro-social behavior. This study examined the effects of LKM in a parenting context, using a fifteen-minute audio-guided LKM. In a group-based design micro trial, a total of 61 parents (50 female, mean age = 38.41 years, SD = 6.11) were randomly assigned to receive a LKM or a matched control focused imagery (FI) exercise. Participants completed a series of measures that examined compassion, parenting and child behavior, and parent’s emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses to a set of six hypothetical vignettes describing difficult child behavior. We also assessed for parents’ acceptability towards LKM as a strategy. As predicted, parents who received LKM displayed higher levels of self-compassion and motivation to show themselves compassion compared to the control group; however not compassion towards others. Parents in the LKM compared to the FI group also had more positive (e.g., calm and sympathetic) and less negative emotional (e.g., frustration and anger) responses to the situations of childhood distress; however, parent’s cognitive and behavioral responses did not significantly change. Parent’s also found LKM to be highly acceptable, with 60% indicating they would complete it weekly. The present findings suggest that LKM might be a valuable component to include in evidence-based parenting interventions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives As an important trend in the research on and practice of mindfulness, second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) expanded components and emphasized ethics and wisdom. The current article proposes another important feature of SG-MBIs, the cultivation of ideal mentalities, such as the nondifferential four immeasurables (i.e., equal prosocial attitudes toward different people) and mentalities of emptiness or oneness. Method The current article theoretically discusses and analyzes the challenges and contributions of SG-MBIs in cultivating ideal mentalities. Results The new feature of SG-MBIs, cultivation of ideal mentalities, leads to five interconnected challenges for research and practice: (1) providing empirical and theoretical support for new elements; (2) matching the purposes of interventions with the needs of trainees; (3) achieving ideal mentalities during interventions; (4) assessing ideal mentalities in proper ways; and (5) clarifying the ethics and values for trainees. Conclusions These challenges posed by the new feature need to be discussed and addressed in the future. Nevertheless, SG-MBIs effectively embody the objectives of ideal psychology and illustrate methodological principles in research on ideal mentalities, which will benefit research on other ideal mentalities rooted in different traditions.

AB  - Loving‐kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) was a promising intervention for improving life satisfaction, but previous findings have been inconsistent. The current study provides a systematic review and meta‐analysis, including 23 empirical studies on LKCM with life satisfaction as an outcome variable. The primary meta‐analysis indicated that LKCM significantly enhanced life satisfaction in pre‐post design (g = 0.312, k = 15, n = 451), but the significance disappeared in the additional meta‐analysis based on randomized controlled trials (g = 0.106, k = 6, n = 404). Moderator analyses found significant effects for type of control (i.e., the effects of LKCM were inferior to active control group, but superior to waitlist condition), but not for other moderators (i.e., participant type, previous meditation experience, specific protocol, components of LKCM, combination with mindfulness mediation, and intervention length). Narrative review identified self‐compassion and positive emotions as important mediators. The practice time of LKCM had indirect but not direct association with life satisfaction. The findings supported that LKCM is promising in increasing life satisfaction, but more studies are needed to investigate the effects with more rigorous designs. Future studies should investigate other potential mechanisms and clarify whether LKCM change the reality or the perception of life. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and aims: Workaholism is a form of behavioral addiction that can lead to reduced life and job satisfaction, anxiety, depression, burnout, work-family conflict, and impaired productivity. Given the number of people affected, there is a need for more targeted workaholism treatments. Findings from previous case studies successfully utilizing second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) for treating behavioral addiction suggest that SG-MBIs may be suitable for treating workaholism. This study conducted a controlled trial to investigate the effects of an SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (MAT) on workaholism. Methods: Male and female adults suffering from workaholism (n = 73) were allocated toMAT or a waiting-list control group. Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up phases. Results: MAT participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control-group participants in workaholism symptomatology, job satisfaction, work engagement, work duration, and psychological distress. Furthermore, compared to the control group, MAT participants demonstrated a significant reduction in hours spent working but without a decline in job performance. Discussion and conclusions:MAT may be a suitable intervention for treating workaholism. Further controlled intervention studies investigating the effects of SG-MBIs on workaholism are warranted.

AB  - Training attention and awareness in mindfulness meditation is theorized to be essential for the cultivation of mindfulness and its salutary outcomes. Yet, the empirical foundation for this central premise in mindfulness science is surprisingly small due to a limited methodological capacity to measure attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation. Accordingly, we set out to measure and study these processes in a laboratory study (N = 143, 76.92% female) using a novel behavioral measurement paradigm—the mindful awareness task (MAT). We empirically characterized attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation and found novel behavioral evidence indicating that, as long-theorized, these processes were related to previous mindfulness meditation practice, attitudinal qualities of mindfulness, attention regulation, and mental health. Furthermore, we found that the accuracy of self-reported mindfulness was, paradoxically, dependent on behavioral capacities for mindful awareness; and that sustained visual attention and executive functions, measured via cognitive-experimental tasks, were not meaningfully related to attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation. In contrast, the MAT demonstrated sound psychometric performance as a measure of mindful awareness, and may overcome significant limitations of extant mindfulness measurement methods. Collectively, findings challenge conceptual and methodological assumptions in mindfulness science, provide a novel paradigmatic direction for research on mindfulness, and present long-awaited evidence that attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation may indeed be fundamental to its practice, cultivation, and salutary functions. Public Significance Statement: Mindfulness meditation is implemented in a variety of settings and applications. Yet we lack empirical evidence, and methods to study, a central premise of this intervention approach—that training attention and awareness through mindfulness meditation is essential to its practice and salutary functions. Using a novel behavioral measurement paradigm, we provide long-awaited support for this central premise and show that this paradigm may help advance empirical understanding of mindfulness.

AB  - A lot has happened in the 20 years since Baer (2003) published the first meta-analysis of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice. The year 2003 was a time before the iPhone, before Facebook, long before the COVID-19 pandemic, and certainly before advances in artificial intelligence brought algorithm- delivered content to our digital devices and large language models could mimic human interaction disturbingly well. Yet, Baer’s meta-analysis examined the effects of MBIs on the same clinical challenges that plague us today: depression, anxiety, stress, and pain. In 2003, self-compassion was only just emerging as a term in the scientific lexicon and experimental work studying interventions based on loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) was still almost a decade away. Now that the LKCM literature has grown large enough to allow large-scale meta-analyses like that conducted by Lv et al. (2023), it seems an opportune time to look toward the MBI literature—looking backward for lessons learned and looking forward for innovations on the horizon—to help guide the younger but no less promising field of LKCM research.
