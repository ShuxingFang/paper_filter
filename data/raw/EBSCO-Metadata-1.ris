AB  - Loving-kindness meditation has been recognized as a valuable form of meditation practice and features in most mindfulness programs. The present research explored the potential of an alternative non-meditative loving-kindness practice; namely, loving-kindness coloring. University students (N= 180) were randomly assigned to the loving-kindness coloring condition or the meditation condition. Both loving-kindness meditation and loving-kindness coloring were explored by measuring state mindfulness, pre-, and post-intervention. Results indicated that both conditions similarly increased in-state mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreased state anxiety, while there were non-significant differences between the practices. We concluded that there are similar levels of effectiveness to loving kindness meditation when introducing loving kindness coloring. Future implications on the applicability of loving-kindness practices are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Metastatic colorectal cancer is one of the commonest causes of cancer and cancer-related deaths.1 The prognosis remains poor and successive treatment options remain limited.2 Many patients will run out of treatment options before they become medically unfit for therapy.3 Cancer drug innovation presents both opportunities and dilemmas as access to innovative cancer medications can be limited by a significant delay between clinical trials, licensing, and positive drug guidance.4,5 Consequently, where no commissioned alternative medicine exists some pharmaceutical companies operate compassionate usage access schemes (Figure 1). These allow cancer treatment with investigational, unlicensed, or off-label medicines as soon as early evidence of potential benefit emerges.6 There is a paucity of information regarding compassionate schemes. This analysis was performed to ascertain real-world data on patients enrolled in these schemes. Methods: Single-centre study conducted at The Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK. We reviewed the process of pharmacy drug set-up and maintenance by undertaking a survey of disease group pharmacists. We undertook a retrospective audit using an electronic patient record of patients who entered into a compassionate scheme between 2018 and 2020. This analysis focused on 27 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer receiving compassionate medication who possessed the BRAF mutation (mBRAF V600E) or MSI-H status. We analysed 17 mBRAF patients treated with a triplet combination (encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab), and subsequently, doublet (encorafenib and cetuximab), as defined by the BEACON study, and 10 MSI-high patients on compassionate nivolumab.7,8 Results: Our survey of compassionate medication across 14 disease groups demonstrated the approval process is lengthy and resource intensive. The average approval time was variable, but pharmacy set-up time could take several days depending on the drug or regimen. However, this is countered by our analysis of 27 meta-static colorectal cancer patients. Most patients were fit (> 88% PS ≤ 1, 50% had no known co-morbidities) and for 62% this represented third- line therapy, in a cancer setting with limited or no treatment options. Patients received 10 cycles of treatment on average before progression or unsuitability, with a mean duration on the treatment of 120 days (15–317) on the triplet/doublet combination and 205 days on nivolumab (range: 1–663), demonstrating benefit. Patient demand was uninhibited by geographical distance (> 30% of patients lived 20+ miles away from the treatment centre) and the possibility of hope and life extension with further treatment. Conclusion: Our audit demonstrates that patients received compassionate drugs that were subsequently commissioned by NHSE, with some benefiting from treatment for a considerable period. This suggests there was both a moral gain and a survival advantage over best supportive care; however, there remains limited real-world data and further research is required. Access to compassionate schemes is controversial and limited as they can be seen to promote healthcare inequity, creating a post-code lottery, as they may not be available in some regions, circumvent existing guidelines or benefit pharmaceutical companies by allowing early data and market access. Compassionate usage recognises a human side to drug development which requires a moral balance between patients. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives: CaringBridge (CB) is an online health community for people undergoing challenging health journeys. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is a systemized mind-body approach developed to increase loving acceptance and has previously been reported to increase resilience in the face of adversity. Materials and Methods: Results of a randomized controlled trial of immediate compared with deferred 21-day LKM intervention in an online community are reported. The deferred group received LKM intervention after a waiting period of 3 weeks. Inclusion criteria were >18 years old, ability to understand English, willingness to participate in a mind-body practice, and use of CB for a cancer journey. Change in perceived stress, self-compassion, social connectedness and assurance, and compassionate love scales from baseline to 21 days was assessed. Results: Of the 979 participants included in the study, 649 (66%) provided 3-week follow-up data and 330 (49%) self-reported engaging in the LKM practice 5 or more days/week. Participants in the immediate LKM group reported medium effect size improvement in stress (0.4), self-compassion (0.5), and social connectedness (0.4) compared with the deferred LKM group. Changes in perceived stress and self-compassion were larger in magnitude and increased with more frequent engagement in LKM. Conclusions: The immediate LKM group showed improvements in stress, self-compassion, and social connectedness compared with the deferred control group. Differential study retention rates by treatment arm and self-reported engagement in LKM subject the results to selection bias. Future research of similar interventions within online health communities might pay greater attention to promoting intervention adherence and engaging a more diverse economic and racial/ethnic population.

AB  - Abstract: Our recent finding of a meditation‐related increase in low‐frequency NREM sleep EEG oscillatory activities peaking in the theta‐alpha range (4–12 Hz) was not predicted. From a consolidated body of research on sleep homeostasis, we would expect a change peaking in slow wave activity (1–4 Hz) following an intense meditation session. Here we compared these changes in sleep with the post‐meditation changes in waking rest scalp power to further characterize their functional significance. High‐density EEG recordings were acquired from 27 long‐term meditators (LTM) on three separate days at baseline and following two 8‐hr sessions of either mindfulness or compassion‐and‐loving‐kindness meditation. Thirty‐one meditation‐naïve participants (MNP) were recorded at the same time points. As a common effect of meditation practice, we found increases in low and fast waking EEG oscillations for LTM only, peaking at eight and 15 Hz respectively, over prefrontal, and left centro‐parietal electrodes. Paralleling our previous findings in sleep, there was no significant difference between meditation styles in LTM as well as no difference between matched sessions in MNP. Meditation‐related changes in wakefulness and NREM sleep were correlated across space and frequency. A significant correlation was found in the EEG low frequencies (<12 Hz). Since the peak of coupling was observed in the theta‐alpha oscillatory range, sleep homeostatic response to meditation practice is not sufficient to explain our findings. Another likely phenomenon into play is a reverberation of meditation‐related processes during subsequent sleep. Future studies should ascertain the interplay between these processes in promoting the beneficial effects of meditation practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is considerable interest in developing complementary and integrative approaches for ameliorating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compassion meditation (CM) and loving-kindness meditation appear to offer benefits to individuals with PTSD, including symptom reduction. The present study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of CM for PTSD in veterans. The CM condition, an adaptation of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT®), consists of exercises to stabilize attention, develop present-moment awareness, and foster compassion. We compared CM to Veteran.calm (VC), which consists of psychoeducation about PTSD, rationale for relaxation, relaxation training, and sleep hygiene. Both conditions consist of 10 weekly 90-min group sessions with between-session practice assignments. A total of 28 veterans attended at least one session of the group intervention and completed pre- and posttreatment measures of PTSD severity and secondary outcomes as well as weekly measures of PTSD, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative emotions. Measures of treatment credibility, attendance, practice compliance, and satisfaction were administered to assess feasibility. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a more substantive reduction in PTSD symptoms in the CM condition than in the VC condition, between-group d = -0.85. Credibility, attendance, and satisfaction were similar across CM and VC conditions thus demonstrating the feasibility of CM and the appropriateness of VC as a comparison condition. The findings of this initial randomized pilot study provide rationale for future studies examining the efficacy and effectiveness of CM for veterans with PTSD. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Resumen: Spanish Abstracts by Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Meditación de compasión para el trastorno de estrés postraumático en veteranos: un estudio aleatorio de prueba de concepto MEDITACIÓN DE COMPASIÓN PARA EL TEPT Existe un interés considerable en desarrollar enfoques complementarios e integrativos para mejorar el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). La meditación de compasión (CM en su sigla en inglés) y la meditación de bondad amorosa (LKM, en su sigla en inglés) parecen ofrecer beneficios a las personas con trastorno de estrés postraumático, incluida la reducción de síntomas. El presente estudio fue un ensayo piloto controlado aleatorizado de CM para el TEPT en veteranos. La condición de CM, una adaptación del entrenamiento de compasión de base cognitiva (CBCT® en sus siglas en inglés), consiste en ejercicios para estabilizar la atención, desarrollar la conciencia del momento presente y fomentar la compasión. Comparamos CM con Veteran.calm (VC en sus siglas en inglés), que consiste en psicoeducación sobre el TEPT y las razones para la relajación, entrenamiento de relajación e higiene del sueño. Ambas condiciones consisten en 10 sesiones de grupo semanales de 90 minutos con tareas de práctica entre sesiones. Un total de 28 veteranos asistieron al menos a una sesión de la intervención grupal y completaron las medidas previas y posteriores al tratamiento de la gravedad del TEPT y resultados secundarios, así como las medidas semanales de TEPT, síntomas depresivos y emociones positivas y negativas. Las medidas de credibilidad del tratamiento, asistencia, cumplimiento de la práctica y satisfacción se administraron para evaluar la viabilidad. Un análisis de la varianza de medidas repetidas reveló una reducción más sustancial en síntomas de TEPT en la condición de CM que en la condición de VC, d de Cohen = ‐0.85 entre grupos. La credibilidad, la asistencia y la satisfacción fueron similares en todas las condiciones de CM y VC y demostraron la viabilidad de CM y la idoneidad de VC como condición de comparación. Los hallazgos de este estudio piloto aleatorizado inicial proporcionan una base para futuros estudios que examinan la eficacia y la efectividad de CM para los veteranos con TEPT.

AB  - Objectives: Mindful Moment is a self-guided, web-based, mindful, and compassionate parenting training for postpartum mothers who experience parenting stress. We aimed to assess Mindful Moment’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability, and to gather preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in reducing parenting stress and outcomes such as mindful parenting, self-compassion, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, dispositional mindfulness, mother’s perception of infant temperament, and mother-infant bonding. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was a two-arm trial and followed the CONSORT 2010, CONSORT-EHEALTH, and CONSORT-SPI 2018 extension guidelines. A total of 292 Portuguese mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 146) or to the waiting list control group (n = 146) and completed baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2) self-reported assessments. Results: A total of 31 mothers (21.23%) completed the Mindful Moment intervention. Most mothers evaluated the program as good or excellent (90%), considered that Mindful Moment provided them the kind of help they expected or wanted (61%), were satisfied with the help provided by the program (74.6%), would recommend it to a friend in a similar situation (86.4%), and would use it again if needed (81.4%). Regarding the program’s preliminary effectiveness, mothers in the intervention group presented a greater decrease in parenting stress, a greater increase in dispositional mindfulness, and a greater decrease in their perception of the difficult temperament of their infants from T1 to T2. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the Mindful Moment’s effectiveness and suggests that it is a feasible and acceptable program for postpartum mothers experiencing parenting stress. Further research is needed to confirm these results in a larger RCT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Traditional moral philosophy has long focused on rationality, principled thinking, and good old-fashioned willpower, but recent evidence strongly suggests that moral judgments and prosocial behavior are more heavily influenced by emotion and intuition. As the evidence mounts, rational traditions emphasizing deliberative analysis and conscious decision making are called into question. The first section highlights some compelling evidence supporting the primacy of affective states in motivating moral judgments and behavior. The real challenge is finding a way to align intuition with desired behavior. In cool reflective states, one may desire to be a kind and loving person. But when it is time to act, the moment is often accompanied by strong affect-laden intuitions. I argue that if affective states are the primary motivators of behavior, then moral sentiments must be trained through habituation in order to increase prosocial behavior. The second section provides empirical evidence linking emotional training with increased prosociality. To highlight this connection, focus is placed on the relationship between habitual meditation training, compassion, and prosocial behavior. Recent studies by Antoine Lutz, Richard Davidson, Susanne Leiberg, and others show that various meditation practices can dramatically affect the human person at various levels, i.e., increased physical health, neural restructuring, regulation and development of emotions, and increased helping behavior, to name a few. The current article focuses on the impact the habit of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has on compassion and prosocial behavior. Recent studies strongly support the conclusion that LKM training hones compassion and ultimately leads to an increase in compassionate behavior. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Sex addiction is a disorder that can have serious adverse functional consequences. Treatment effectiveness research for sex addiction is currently underdeveloped, and interventions are generally based on the guidelines for treating other behavioral (as well as chemical) addictions. Consequently, there is a need to clinically evaluate tailored treatments that target the specific symptoms of sex addiction. It has been proposed that second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) may be an appropriate treatment for sex addiction because in addition to helping individuals increase perceptual distance from craving for desired objects and experiences, some SG-MBIs specifically contain meditations intended to undermine attachment to sex and/or the human body. The current study conducts the first clinical investigation into the utility of mindfulness for treating sex addiction. Case presentation: An in-depth clinical case study was conducted involving an adult male suffering from sex addiction that underwent treatment utilizing an SG-MBI known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT). Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as reductions in depression and psychological distress. The MAT intervention also led to improvements in sleep quality, job satisfaction, and non-attachment to self and experiences. Salutary outcomes were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Discussion and conclusion: The current study extends the literature exploring the applications of mindfulness for treating behavioral addiction, and findings indicate that further clinical investigation into the role of mindfulness for treating sex addiction is warranted.

AB  - Eighty-seven preservice teachers, some of whom had preschool teaching experience, were randomly assigned to an intervention that included training in breathing awareness meditation infused with social-emotional learning (n = 43) or a control group that received training in (n = 44) in breathing awareness meditation only. Both groups showed an increase in mindfulness from pre- to posttest. However, as expected, dimensions of emotional competence improved more significantly for preservice teachers in the intervention group. Increases were also greater for participants with teaching experience. Both groups also increased in the belief that classroom misbehavior would result in negative cognitive and social costs to children, but a larger increasewas observed for the intervention group. Implications for teacher preparation are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives: Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) have emphasized the cultivation of ethics. However, some ethics and values that are emphasized in SG-MBIs are criticized by Confucianism, one of the most influential traditions in China. The current study developed a new SG-MBI called mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) that emphasized value clarification and integrated Confucian values. The acceptability and effects of this intervention were evaluated among Chinese people in mainland China. Methods: A total of 138 healthy Chinese adults from universities and communities were randomly assigned to the MBPP or waitlist condition. Consistent with the 'relief,' 'promotion,' and 'transcendence' modules in MBPP, variables representing negative symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress), positive traits (gratitude and appreciative joy), and spirituality (meaning of life) were measured before and after the 6-week intervention and 3 months after the intervention. The amount of meditation practice and ratings for MBPP and different themes were also measured. Results: Compared to the waitlist condition, MBPP significantly reduced anxiety and stress with low to medium effect sizes but not other measures. The amount of meditation practice during the intervention was significantly associated with changes in appreciative joy and gratitude. Participants rated the MBPP and themes highly, and themes in the 'transcendence' module received significantly lower ratings than other themes. Conclusions: MBPP is a feasible and promising SG-MBI for promoting mental health among Chinese. Future studies should further evaluate the acceptability and effects of the new components of SG-MBIs and develop suitable measurements for those idealistic mentalities proposed by Buddhism and other traditions.

AB  - Self-criticism is a vulnerability risk factor for a number of psychological disorders, and it predicts poor response to psychological and pharmacological treatments. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) programme designed to increase self-compassion in a sample of self-critical individuals. Thirty-eight individuals with high scores on the self-critical perfectionism subscale of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale were randomized to an LKM condition ( n = 19) or a wait-list (WL) condition ( n = 19). Measures of self-criticism, self-compassion and psychological distress were administered before and immediately following the intervention (LKM or WL). WL participants received the intervention immediately after the waiting period. Both groups were assessed 3 months post-intervention. Intent-to-treat ( n = 38) and per-protocol analyses ( n = 32) showed significant reductions in self-criticism and depressive symptoms as well as significant increases in self-compassion and positive emotions in the LKM condition compared with the WL condition. A follow-up per-protocol analysis in both groups together ( n = 20) showed that these gains were maintained 3 months after the intervention. These preliminary results suggest that LKM may be efficacious in alleviating self-criticism, increasing self-compassion and improving depressive symptoms among self-critical individuals. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Self-criticism plays a major role in many psychological disorders and predicts poor response to brief psychological and pharmacological treatments for depression., The current study shows that loving-kindness meditation, designed to foster self-compassion, is efficacious in helping self-critical individuals become less self-critical and more self-compassionate., The study also suggests that practising loving-kindness may reduce depressive symptoms and increase positive emotions.

AB  - Weight stigma is highly prevalent. However, existing weight stigma interventions are only modestly effective at reducing anti-fat attitudes. The current research proposes a novel approach using a loving kindness meditation (LKM). Experiment 1 tests whether random assignment to the LKM intervention reduces explicit and implicit anti-fat bias and increases empathy based on the LKM recipient with higher weight (close other vs. stranger). Experiment 2 tests whether LKM outperforms an empathy intervention or control to increase empathy or reduce stigmatizing behavior. Results revealed that the LKM increased empathic care but did not reduce anti-fat bias compared to control; the LKM intervention, but not the empathy intervention, reported greater empathy compared to control in unadjusted analyses; and participants in the LKM and empathy interventions (vs. control) were more likely to engage in stigmatizing behavior. These findings suggest that the LKM may not be effective at reducing weight stigma despite increasing empathy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study involved developing a positive psychological intervention program for fostering selected positive psychological strengths and examining its efficacy in improving resilience among institutionalized adolescents at risk for developmental adaptation using a pre-post-follow-up control group design. The sample included 45 institutional adolescents (Males=22, Females=23) in the experimental group and 45 (Males=22, Females=23) in the control group. The intervention focused on improving probabilistic orientation, gratitude, and forgiveness using different methods of delivery including conceptual teaching, storytelling, exercises and loving-kindness meditation. The intervention was delivered in nine sessions spread over eight weeks. Self-reported measures of probabilistic orientation, forgiveness, forgiveness likelihood, gratitude, and resilience were used to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Academic achievement, an objective measure obtained from the school records was also included to assess the efficacy of the intervention. ANCOVA, ANOVA, and Student's t-test were used to analyze the data. The findings suggest that the evidence-based positive intervention had improved the probabilistic orientation, forgiveness, and gratitude of the institutionalized adolescents. Further, the intervention is found to have resulted in the enhancement of resilience, academic achievement, as well as the overall well-being of the participants. The findings confirm that enriching the inner protectors of the adolescents at-risk may be effective in enhancing their developmental adaptation and well-being thanks to the interaction between the protectors and the risk factors in the environment.

AB  - The concept of self-compassion originated from Buddhism, but very little is known about the utility and functions of this concept among Buddhists. Four hundred and eleven individuals (179 Buddhists and 232 non-Buddhists) completed the survey packages using the self-compassion scale (SCS; Neff in Self Identity 2(3):223-250, 2003a. doi:). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the original six dimensions of the SCS were not replicated by both samples, and further analysis of the intra-correlations within dimensions of SCS and relationships between SCS and other variables showed unexpected results specific to Buddhists. Among Buddhists, the dimensions of self-kindness and common humanity neither showed negative correlations with their opposite dimensions nor were associated with better emotional outcomes. In addition, these two dimensions were not predicted by the regular practice of loving-kindness meditation. This study argued that the ideas of self-compassion reflected in the SCS are theoretically different from the ideas of Buddhism, and further implications for measuring and clinically applying self-compassion were discussed.

AB  - An attempt has been made to study the integration of Buddhist meditation practices into subjective well-being of healthy individuals engaged in formal meditation methods. Based on the Abhidhamma model of mental health (the primary mental factors of classical Buddhist Psychology), it was observed that from a full range of negative, unhealthy attitudes that stand in the way of healthy psychological development the individuals started flourishing healthy perceptual cognitive and affective states. The subjects practiced Buddhist meditation like Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing), Metta Bhavana (Loving Kindness) and experienced a self-reinforcing degree of internal change along the continuum of mental states toward the healthy pole. The paper will discuss pre-post and follow up data on self report measures and meditation as a potential health promotion tool. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The aim of this randomized pilot study is to investigate the effects of a short training programme in loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKM/CM) in patients with borderline personality disorder. Patients were allocated to LKM/CM or mindfulness continuation training (control group). Patients in the LKM/CM group showed greater changes in Acceptance compared with the control group. Remarkable changes in borderline symptomatology, self-criticism and self-kindness were also observed in the LKM/CM group. Mechanistic explanations and therapeutic implications of the findings are discussed. Highlights: Three weeks of loving-kindness and compassion meditations increased acceptance of the present-moment experience in patients with borderline personality disorder., Significant improvements in the severity of borderline symptoms, self-criticism, mindfulness, acceptance and self-kindness were observed after the LKM/CM intervention., LKM/CM is a promising complementary strategy for inclusion in mindfulness-based interventions and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy for treating core symptoms in borderline personality disorder., Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The present research investigates whether and how mindfulness meditation influences the guilt-driven tendency to repair harm caused to others. Through a series of eight experiments (N > 1,400), we demonstrate that state mindfulness cultivated via focused-breathing meditation can dampen the relationship between transgressions and the desire to engage in reparative prosocial behaviors. Experiment 1 showed that induced state mindfulness reduced state guilt. Experiments 2a–2c found that induced state mindfulness reduced the willingness to engage in reparative behaviors in normally guilt-inducing situations. Experiments 3a and 3b found that guilt mediated the negative effect of mindfulness meditation on prosocial reparation. Experiment 4 demonstrated that induced state mindfulness weakened the link between a transgression and reparative behavior, as well as documented the mediating role of guilt over and above other emotions. Finally, in Experiment 5, we found that loving kindness meditation led to significantly more prosocial reparation than focused-breathing meditation, mediated by increased other-focus and feelings of love. We discuss theoretical and practical implications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective The primary aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of a ‘mindful eating’ programme for reducing emotional eating in patients with overweight or obesity. Method A cluster randomized controlled trial (reg. NCT03927534) was conducted with 76 participants with overweight/obesity who were assigned to ‘mindful eating’ (7 weeks) + treatment as usual (TAU), or to TAU alone. They were assessed at baseline, posttreatment and 12‐month follow‐up. The main outcome was ‘emotional eating’ (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, DEBQ); other eating behaviours were also assessed along with psychological and physiological variables. Results ‘Mindful eating’ + TAU reduced emotional eating both at posttreatment (B = −0.27; p = 0.006; d = 0.35) and follow‐up (B = −0.53; p < 0.001; d = 0.69) compared to the control group (TAU alone). ‘External eating’ (DEBQ) was also significantly improved by the intervention at both timepoints. Significant effects at follow‐up were observed for some secondary outcomes related to bulimic behaviours, mindful eating, mindfulness, and self‐compassion. Weight and other physiological parameters were not significantly affected by ‘mindful eating’ + TAU. Conclusions These findings support the efficacy of the ‘mindful eating’ + TAU programme for reducing emotional and external eating, along with some other secondary measures, but no significant changes in weight reduction were observed.

AB  - Mental health is integral to our well-being and is as important as being physically healthy. The growing incidence of mental health issues in adolescents is a reflection of the reality that confronts us today. Primary Prevention (PP) of mental illnesses especially depression in children and adolescents has only recently taken a hold as distinct from secondary and tertiary preventions. PP for adolescent depression encompasses school based resilience building interventions and community based stigma reduction programme at large. However, the aim of this article is limited to the introduction of approaches that help gradually build and strengthen the resilience factors and promoting the well being by developing new positive behavior among normal adolescents. This new recognition was born out of the necessity as new Mental Health Care Act (MHCA, 2017) places more emphasis on prevention of mental illness and the world health day of this year was celebrated with the theme of "Depression- let's Talk" in terms of preventive measures. Depression is a major public health problem in children and adolescents, which makes the identification and implementation of effective interventions an increasing concern at universal or PP level. Therefore, the main aim of this article is to discuss theoretically different psychological interventions for depression in terms of primary prevention. This article presents and discusses new interventions with rationale, such as the Positive Psychology and Mindfulness based interventions for Adolescents, which suggest that the focus of interventions for depressed adolescents should integrate well-being enhancement to achieve optimal functioning as a primary prevention strategies.

AB  - Surveys were conducted at two metta meditation retreats in order to examine the psychological effects of metta meditation. Participants were invited to complete the survey at the beginning of the retreat, at the end of the retreat, and two weeks after the end of the retreat. Participants completed the same scales at each time phase, which included measures of happiness, compassionate love, revenge and avoidance motivation, gratitude, and a depression, anxiety and stress scale. Significant increases were found in happiness and compassionate love, reductions in avoidance and revenge, and reductions on the depression, anxiety and stress subscales. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We investigated whether informal meditation practice (i.e., self-reported application of meditative techniques outside a period of formal meditation) was associated with outcomes in smartphone-based loving-kindness and compassion training. Meditation-naïve participants (n = 351) with clinically elevated symptoms completed measures of psychological distress, loneliness, empathy, and prosociality at baseline and following a two-week intervention. Informal practice, psychological distress, and loneliness were also assessed daily. Steeper increases in informal practice had small associations with pre-post improvements in distress (r = −.18, p =.008) and loneliness (r = −.19, p =.009) but not empathy or prosociality. Using a currently recommended approach for establishing cross-lagged effects in longitudinal data (latent curve model with structured residuals), higher current-day informal practice was associated with decreased next-day distress with a very small effect size (β s = −.06 to −.04, p =.018) but not decreased next-day loneliness. No cross-lagged associations emerged from distress or loneliness to informal practice. Findings suggest that further investigation into a potential causal role of informal practice is warranted. Future studies experimentally manipulating informal practice are needed. • Increased informal practice was correlated with pre-post reductions in distress. • Increased informal practice was correlated with pre-post reductions in loneliness. • Higher current-day informal practice predicted lower next-day distress. • No cross-lagged effects of distress or loneliness on informal practice. • Further investigation into a causal role of informal practice is warranted.

AB  - Loving-kindness meditations involve sending feelings of kindness and care to a series of people including oneself, loved ones, strangers, and all beings. Loving-kindness interventions (LKIs), which include knowledge and/or practice related to loving-kindness, have been gaining attention as a potential intervention for improving mental health in adults. This meta-analysis synthesized the effects of LKIs on both positive (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, positive affect) and negative (i.e., negative affect, psychological symptoms) indices of mental health across comparison types (i.e., passive control, active control, alternative treatment) and general sample types (i.e., community, university), and explored characteristics of LKIs that may impact their effectiveness (i.e., intervention format, intervention length, presence/absence of a live facilitator). Following a systematic review of six databases in November 2023, 23 randomized controlled studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Relative to passive control groups, LKIs had positive effects on mindfulness, compassion, positive affect, negative affect, and psychological symptoms; these effects were non-significant relative to active control groups and alternative therapeutic treatments. Notably, the effects of LKIs did not differ as a function of sample type, intervention format, intervention length, or the presence/absence of a live facilitator. Findings provide support for the effectiveness of LKIs relative to passive control conditions, as well as their potential comparability to alternative evidence-based therapeutic treatments, and provide insight into resource-effective approaches to the delivery of effective LKIs. However, additional studies are needed to confirm the impacts of LKIs relative to other interventions in the field. • Loving-kindness interventions (LKIs) have positive effects on mental health. • The significance of effects vary by comparison type (e.g., passive/active control). • LKI characteristics (e.g., length, format) do not moderate these effects. • LKIs may be a viable therapeutic approach to improve positive and negative mental health. • Additional rigorously designed studies evaluating the effects of LKIs are needed.

AB  - Loving-kindness meditation is a practice designed to enhance feelings of kindness and compassion for self and others. Loving-kindness meditation involves repetition of phrases of positive intention for self and others. We undertook an open pilot trial of loving-kindness meditation for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Measures of PTSD, depression, self-compassion, and mindfulness were obtained at baseline, after a 12-week loving-kindness meditation course, and 3 months later. Effect sizes were calculated from baseline to each follow-up point, and self-compassion was assessed as a mediator. Attendance was high; 74% attended 9-12 classes. Self-compassion increased with large effect sizes and mindfulness increased with medium to large effect sizes. A large effect size was found for PTSD symptoms at 3-month follow-up ( d = −0.89), and a medium effect size was found for depression at 3-month follow-up ( d = −0.49). There was evidence of mediation of reductions in PTSD symptoms and depression by enhanced self-compassion. Overall, loving-kindness meditation appeared safe and acceptable and was associated with reduced symptoms of PTSD and depression. Additional study of loving-kindness meditation for PTSD is warranted to determine whether the changes seen are due to the loving-kindness meditation intervention versus other influences, including concurrent receipt of other treatments.

AB  - Imagination-based loving-kindness meditation (ibLKM), a new method that combines blessing and imagination developed from the scriptures of Zhiyi, has recently been proposed. The current study aims to examine one of the possible effects of this method through an empirical research approach: the enhancement of responses to pain. In the present study, 59 participants in three groups practiced ibLKM, focused attention meditation (FAM), and watched an unrelated video, respectively. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from participants who were presented with painful and non-painful pictures before and after meditation practices. Participants were asked to judge whether the stimulus was a painful picture or a non-painful picture. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses revealed that the LPP amplitudes over the central-parietal area elicited by the painful pictures were significantly more positive than those before the meditation practices in the ibLKM and FAM groups. The P3 amplitudes over the central-parietal area were significantly more positive in the posttest than in the pretest when viewing painful pictures in the FAM group. In contrast, in the ibLKM, the P3 amplitudes were not significantly different in the pretest and posttest when viewing painful pictures. These results suggested that ibLKM and FAM temporarily enhance responses to pain in different ways. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Meditation has been integrated into different therapeutic interventions. To inform the evidence-based selection of specific meditation types it is crucial to understand the neural processes associated with different meditation practices. Here we explore commonalities and differences in electroencephalographic oscillatory spatial synchronisation patterns across three important meditation types. Highly experienced meditators engaged in focused attention, open monitoring, and loving kindness meditation. Improving on previous research, our approach avoids comparisons between groups that limited previous findings, while ensuring that the meditation states are reliably established. Employing a novel measure of neural coupling – the imaginary part of EEG coherence – the study revealed that all meditation conditions displayed a common connectivity pattern that is characterised by increased connectivity of (a) broadly distributed delta networks, (b) left-hemispheric theta networks with a local integrating posterior focus, and (c) right-hemispheric alpha networks, with a local integrating parieto-occipital focus. Furthermore, each meditation state also expressed specific synchronisation patterns differentially recruiting left- or right-lateralised beta networks. These observations provide evidence that in addition to global patterns, frequency-specific inter-hemispheric asymmetry is one major feature of meditation, and that mental processes specific to each meditation type are also supported by lateralised networks from fast-frequency bands.

AB  - This study examined the dissociable neural effects of anapanasati  (focused-attention meditation, FAM) and metta (loving-kindness meditation, LKM)  on BOLD signals during cognitive (continuous performance test, CPT) and  affective (emotion-processing task, EPT, in which participants viewed affective  pictures) processing. Twenty-two male Chinese expert meditators (11 FAM experts,  11 LKM experts) and 22 male Chinese novice meditators (11 FAM novices, 11 LKM  novices) had their brain activity monitored by a 3T MRI scanner while performing  the cognitive and affective tasks in both meditation and baseline states. We  examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and expertise  (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a conjunction approach  to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert meditative state. Additionally,  exclusive masking techniques revealed distinct interactions between state and  group during LKM and FAM. Specifically, we demonstrated that the practice of FAM  was associated with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural  activation differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of  state LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance. On the  other hand, both FAM and LKM practice appeared to affect the neural responses to  affective pictures. For viewing sad faces, the regions activated for FAM  practitioners were consistent with attention-related processing; whereas  responses of LKM experts to sad pictures were more in line with differentiating  emotional contagion from compassion/emotional regulation processes. Our findings  provide the first report of distinct neural activity associated with forms of  meditation during sustained attention and emotion processing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a type of mindfulness-based meditation that emphasizes caring and connection with others. LKM incorporates nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, which enhances attention, presence, acceptance, and self-regulation; it also entails directing caring feelings toward oneself and then others and emphasizes both self-care and inter. connectedness. Thus, LKM is suitable for helping clients forge healthy connections with them- selves and others. This article examines the use and implications of LKM in counseling. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article, we describe the clinical applicability of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) to individuals suffering from schizophrenia-spectrum disorders with persistent negative symptoms. LKM may have potential for reducing negative symptoms such as anhedonia, avolition, and asociality while enhancing factors consistent with psychological recovery such as hope and purpose in life. Case studies will illustrate how to conduct this group treatment with clients with negative symptoms, the potential benefits to the client, and difficulties that may arise. Although LKM requires further empirical support, it promises to be an important intervention since there are few treatments for clients afflicted with negative symptoms. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - • Valence is positively correlated with state openness, and both stimulate willingness to create. • Audio-guided Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) and Walking Meditation (WM) improve state openness, while audio-guided LKM led to a positive change in valence as well. • State openness rather than improved valence contributes to better performance on convergent thinking. • Robot affordances should be designed according to the goals of the task. Young adults undergoing psychological changes are particularly vulnerable. Recent social isolation impedes interpersonal help while stress from family, school, work, and society has brought negative effects on mental health, even in otherwise healthy young adults. Recent research has shown that daily creativity contributes to well-being. To circumvent issues of contamination, we tried a NAO robot guiding a Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM) and Walking Meditation (WM). By improving mental states (i.e. positive valence and state openness), we stimulated creative behavior to reduce negative mood. Participants (N = 142) were healthy individuals, aged between 18 and 34, joining a one-time laboratory experiment. They responded to two rounds of questionnaires, with a 10 min intervention guided by audio or a NAO robot in between each round. A control group with participants with no treatment (i.e. taking a 10 min rest) was added for comparison. Both audio-guided LKM and WM successfully evoked state openness, with the former also exerting a positive effect on valence. Valence and state openness were positively correlated, and both were associated with a higher willingness to create. With positive valence, young adults likely perform better on convergent thinking. The result may potentially lead to negative mood reduction. The discussion emphasizes the importance of designing specific characteristics of social robots in accordance with the task's context.

AB  - Study Objectives:  We have recently shown higher parietal-occipital EEG gamma activity during sleep in long-term meditators compared to meditation-naive individuals. This gamma increase was specific for NREM sleep, was present throughout the entire night and correlated with meditation expertise, thus suggesting underlying long-lasting neuroplastic changes induced through prolonged training. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroplastic changes acutely induced by 2 intensive days of different meditation practices in the same group of practitioners. We also repeated baseline recordings in a meditation-naive cohort to account for time effects on sleep EEG activity. Design:  High-density EEG recordings of human brain activity were acquired over the course of whole sleep nights following intervention. Setting:  Sound-attenuated sleep research room. Patients or Participants:  Twenty-four long-term meditators and twenty-four meditation-naïve controls. Interventions:  Two 8-h sessions of either a mindfulness-based meditation or a form of meditation designed to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, hereafter referred to as compassion meditation. Measurements and Results:  We found an increase in EEG low-frequency oscillatory activities (1–12 Hz, centered around 7–8 Hz) over prefrontal and left parietal electrodes across whole night NREM cycles. This power increase peaked early in the night and extended during the third cycle to high-frequencies up to the gamma range (25–40 Hz). There was no difference in sleep EEG activity between meditation styles in long-term meditators nor in the meditation naïve group across different time points. Furthermore, the prefrontal-parietal changes were dependent on meditation life experience. Conclusions:  This low-frequency prefrontal-parietal activation likely reflects acute, meditation-related plastic changes occurring during wakefulness, and may underlie a top-down regulation from frontal and anterior parietal areas to the posterior parietal and occipital regions showing chronic, long-lasting plastic changes in long-term meditators.

AB  - Objective: Many interventions designed to increase self-compassion are either (1) intense, group-based, and face-to-face delivered programs, such as Mindful Self-Compassion, or (2) less intense, self-administered interventions, such as self-compassionate writing or following guided meditations. This study explores if self-compassion can be increased in a novel intervention that is both intense and accessible using online group-based interactive video teleconferencing. Method: One-hundred-fifty-five healthy participants (130 women, 25 men) were randomized to a wait-list control group or to an intervention group that participated in two online workshops (via Zoom) and completed a self-compassionate writing exercise. Participants filled out the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) before, directly after, and 1-week after the intervention. We assessed overall self-compassion, in addition to its six constituent subfactors: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. We analyzed all results using an intent-to-treat approach. In addition, participants’ impressions and feasibility of the intervention were assessed. Results: Using linear mixed models, we found that the intervention increased total self-compassion as indicated by a significant interaction of Time and Treatment, F(2, 203.38) = 5.47, p = .005, with a small-to-medium effect, f = 0.22. Contrasts indicated significant differences between the intervention and the control group at the 1-week follow-up, but not directly after the intervention. We found similar effects for self-kindness, common humanity, and isolation. Qualitative answers indicated that participants liked the intervention and were pleased with the opportunity to interact with other participants. Conclusions: Self-compassion can be trained using interactive video teleconferencing interventions. The study highlights the potential benefits of group-based interventions as they allow for more interactions among participants, which in turn could reduce feelings of isolation. Finally, interactive video teleconferencing interventions have large unexplored potential for improving various resources that improve mental health or other facets of well-being other than self-compassion and this article gives recommendations for how to structure such interventions.

AB  - Research on attachment theory holds that insecure attachment influences people’s daily social and emotional experiences. Mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation have been associated with improvements in physical and mental well-being often through their influence on emotion experience and regulation. Yet, little research has examined how emotional well-being may be improved in insecurely attached individuals through meditation practice. We suspected that the emotion profiles of anxious and avoidant attachment may shift with meditation training, both across time and on a particular day. Improving emotional well-being may be especially consequential for those most at risk for negative health outcomes in late life. A diverse community sample of midlife adults raised in low-SES homes (N = 113; 55% white, 87.5% female) completed daily emotion reports for 10 weeks, during which they received 6 weeks of meditation training, randomized to either loving-kindness or mindfulness meditation practice. Results from growth curve analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety and randomized to mindfulness meditation reported significant increases over time in positive emotions alongside decreases in negative emotions. Those high in attachment avoidance reported significant decreases in negative emotions in both meditation groups. On the daily level, within-person dose–response analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety showed the most consistent dose-response relations between the duration of either meditation practice and same-day increases in positive emotions and decreases in negative emotions. These findings highlight how meditation interventions can shift emotion profiles of insecurely attached midlife adults who are at heightened risk for late life chronic illnesses.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical introduction on Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (SG-MBIs) to sport and performance psychology scholars and practitioners. This essay is written as a commentary on Roychowdhury et al.'s, (2021, this issue) article in this issue. Specifically, I apply theoretical insights from Roychowdhury et al., (2021, this issue) to the practical model of SG-MBIs. I find that SG-MBIs attempt to respond to ethical concerns with the ways that mindfulness has been commodified, secularized, and universalized through appeals to cultural authenticity. While acknowledging the cultural contexts from which practices like mindfulness have been taken is important, appeals to cultural authenticity often reproduce fixed and essentializing constructions of culture and are easily coopted by neoliberal multiculturalism. As sport and performance psychology professionals reflect on the next generation of mindfulness-based interventions, it will be important to attend to the contextual flexibility of neoliberalism to universalize and essentialize.

AB  - <bold>Purpose: </bold>Young adult (YA) cancer survivors report substantial distress, social isolation, and body image concerns that can impede successful reintegration into life years after treatment completion. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) interventions focus on developing mindfulness and self-compassion for managing distress, hardships, and perceived personal inadequacies. An MSC intervention would be beneficial in supporting YA survivors' management of psychosocial challenges that arise in survivorship; however, a telehealth intervention modality is essential for reaching this geographically dispersed population. We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of an MSC 8-week videoconference intervention for nationally recruited YA survivors (ages 18-29).<bold>Methods: </bold>The MSC intervention was group-based, 90-minute videoconference sessions, held weekly over 8 weeks, with audio-supplemented home practice. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed via attendance rate and an intervention satisfaction scale. Baseline to post-intervention changes in psychosocial outcomes (body image, anxiety, depression, social isolation, posttraumatic growth, resilience, self-compassion, mindfulness) were assessed using paired t tests and Cohen's d effect sizes.<bold>Results: </bold>Thirty-four participants were consented and 25 attended a videoconference group. Feasibility was established with 84% attending at least six of the eight sessions, and intervention acceptability was high (M = 4.36, SD = 0.40, score range = 1-5). All psychosocial outcomes, except for resilience, demonstrated significant changes (p < 0.002), with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.5).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>YA survivors are interested in receiving an MSC videoconference intervention. Feasibility, acceptance, and potential psychosocial benefits of the intervention were demonstrated. Findings can be applied toward the design of an efficacy randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life for YA survivors in transition after cancer treatment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Positive emotional perceptions and healthy emotional intelligence (EI) are important for social functioning. In this study, we investigated whether loving kindness meditation (LKM) combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would facilitate improvements in EI and changes in affective experience of visual stimuli. LKM has been shown to increase positive emotional experiences and we hypothesized that tDCS could enhance these effects. Eighty-seven undergraduates were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of LKM or a relaxation control recording with anodal tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left dlPFC) or right temporoparietal junction (right TPJ) at 0.1 or 2.0 milliamps. The primary outcomes were self-reported affect ratings of images from the International Affective Picture System and EI as measured by the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Results indicated no effects of training on EI, and no main effects of LKM, electrode placement, or tDCS current strength on affect ratings. There was a significant interaction of electrode placement by meditation condition (p = 0.001), such that those assigned to LKM and right TPJ tDCS, regardless of current strength, rated neutral and positive images more positively after training. Results suggest that LKM may enhance positive affective experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the past fifteen years, positive psychology research has validated a set of happiness enhancing techniques. These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program – PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls. Our results suggest that the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation can be an effective option to organize and deliver positive integrative interventions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Over 12 weeks, loving-kindness meditation buffered telomere attrition. • Telomere length decreased in the mindfulness group and the control group. • The loving-kindness group showed less telomere attrition than the control group. Combinations of multiple meditation practices have been shown to reduce the attrition of telomeres, the protective caps of chromosomes (Carlson et al., 2015). Here, we probed the distinct effects on telomere length (TL) of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Midlife adults (N = 142) were randomized to be in a waitlist control condition or to learn either MM or LKM in a 6-week workshop. Telomere length was assessed 2 weeks before the start of the workshops and 3 weeks after their termination. After controlling for appropriate demographic covariates and baseline TL, we found TL decreased significantly in the MM group and the control group, but not in the LKM group. There was also significantly less TL attrition in the LKM group than the control group. The MM group showed changes in TL that were intermediate between the LKM and control groups yet not significantly different from either. Self-reported emotions and practice intensity (duration and frequency) did not mediate these observed group differences. This study is the first to disentangle the effects of LKM and MM on TL and suggests that LKM may buffer telomere attrition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it has been determined that mindfulness meditations are positively related to personality constructs such as conscientiousness, there is no clear evidence of whether personality can influence the effectiveness of mindfulness intervention. The aim of the current research was to investigate the immediate effects of single sessions of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on state anxiety and state mindfulness and establish whether there is a difference between the outcomes of the two practices. Altruism and boredom were used as covariates to observe whether they have a significant impact on the final results. participants and procedure University students (N = 80) were randomly allocated to either the MM or LKM condition and were asked to complete the scales before and after they listened to audio guided meditation instructions. Prior to the meditation participants completed state mindfulness and state anxiety scales. Post-meditation participants again filled in state mindfulness and state anxiety scales, and trait scales on altruism and boredom. RESULTS: The results indicated that both types of mindfulness-based practices successfully decreased the initial levels of anxiety and elevated state mindfulness. Non-significant differences between the outcomes of the meditative practices were observed when controlling for altruism and boredom. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative practices appeal more to some participants than to others. Clinical implications are discussed with a focus on the beneficial effects of both MM and LKM.

AB  - Continuous exposure to the suffering and death of patients produces certain syndromes such as compassion fatigue in health professionals. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect and the effectiveness of interventions based on mindfulness, aimed at training or cultivating compassion or self-compassion in compassion fatigue, self-compassion, compassion, and compassion satisfaction of health professionals. A systematic review is reported in line with the PRISMA guideline and was registered in PROSPERO. The PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were used. Interventions based on compassion training or cultivation were selected, aimed at health professionals. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The effect size and hetereogeneity of the studies were calculated. Eight articles were selected. Among the programmes for the cultivation of compassion we highlight Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT), Mindfulness and Self-Compassion (MSC), Compassionate Meditation (CM), and Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM). The interventions decreased compassion fatigue and increased compassion, self-compassion, and compassion satisfaction in healthcare professionals. Compassion fatigue in healthcare professionals is due to a deficit in empathic and compassionate skills. Health systems should incorporate programmes based on the cultivation of compassion and self-compassion in order to improve the work conditions and quality of life of health professionals.

AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a meditative practice directing caring feelings toward self and others, is a popular, evidence-base approach to increasing well-being. Music listening is also a popular form of emotion regulation used to enhance well-being. This interdisciplinary study evaluated a novel intervention called Convergence—combining LKM with accompanying classical guitar music—and its effects on adults' well-being, mindfulness, compassion and self-compassion outcomes. Convergence was compared to active control groups LKM-only and Music-only regarding their relative effectiveness in improving these outcomes. Participants (N = 78; aged 18 to 69 years; 90% females; recruited from the general public) were assigned to either the Convergence, LKM-only, or Music-only condition. Each condition received a 2-hour workshop, involving psychoeducation, three prerecorded meditations, and group enquiry and discussion. Participants were assessed at pre-program, post-program, and 4-week follow-up. Findings revealed that Convergence, LKM-only and Music-only were equally effective interventions, producing improvements in dependent variables with small effect sizes. There was no additive effect of the components when delivered together as Convergence. Significant correlations were found between the amount of home practice, and mindfulness and self-compassion at follow-up. LKM, music listening and Convergence all provide brief, evidence-based alternatives for improving well-being. Practical and theoretical implications are provided, as well as recommendations for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based interventions, self-compassion training, and cognitive behavioral therapy have garnered much evidence in its salutary effects on mental health. With increasing application of smartphone and mobile technology on health promotion, this study investigated the efficacy and possible moderators of mindfulness, self- compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation training mobile apps in the improvement of mental health. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of 3 mobile app-based programs: mindfulness-based program, self-compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation program in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. Changes in mindful awareness and self-compassion were also assessed. To further delineate the suitability of each program for different types of individuals, individual difference variables (ie, discomfort with emotions and tolerance for ambiguity) were explored for potential moderation. Methods: This study was a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial examining the efficacy of mindfulness-based program, self- compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation. Participants were randomized into either 1 of the 3 conditions. Throughout the 4-week, 28-session program, participants spent 10-15 min daily reviewing the course content and practicing various related exercises. At preprogram, postprogram, and 3-month follow-up, participants also completed Web-based measures of mental well-being, psychological distress, mindful-awareness, and self-compassion as well as the proposed moderators. Results: Among the 2161 study participants, 508 and 349 completed the post- and 3-month follow-up assessment, respectively. All 3 conditions (mindfulness-based program: N=703; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation: N=753; self-compassion program: N=705) were found to be efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. All conditions enhanced mindful awareness at postprogram. Significant interaction effect was found on self-compassion; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation and self-compassion program, but not mindfulness-based program, significantly enhanced self-compassion at postprogram. No significant differences regarding usage and users' satisfaction were found among the 3 conditions. None of the proposed moderators were found to be significant. Conclusions: Mindfulness-based, self-compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation mobile apps were efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress among adults at postprogram and 3-month follow-up. Future app-based psychological training programs should consider gamification and personalization of content or feedback to enhance engagement and mitigate the high attrition rates that are common in app-based health promotion programs.

AB  - Background Previous research has proposed that there may be potential synergies between psychedelic and meditation interventions, but there are still knowledge gaps that merit further investigation. Methods Using a longitudinal observational research design with samples representative of the US and UK adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 9732), we investigated potential associations between self-reported psychedelic use and meditation practice. Results The follow-up survey was completed by 7667 respondents (79% retention rate), with 100 respondents reporting psychedelic use during the 2-month study period (1.3% of follow-up respondents). In covariate-adjusted regression models, psychedelic use during the study period was associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.40, p = 0.004). Among those who reported psychedelic use during the study period, covariate-adjusted regression models revealed that the subjective experience of insight during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in that period was also associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness and loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.42, p = 0.021; B = 0.38, p = 0.017). Notably, more days of loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week at baseline was associated with less severe subjective feelings of death or dying during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in the study period (B = −0.29, p = 0.037). Conclusions Psychedelic use might lead to greater engagement with meditation practices such as mindfulness meditation, while meditation practices such as loving-kindness or compassion medication might buffer against certain challenging experiences associated with psychedelic use.

AB  - Meditation practice is suggested to engage training of cognitive control systems in the brain. To evaluate the functional involvement of attentional and cognitive monitoring processes during meditation, the present study analysed the electroencephalographic synchronization of fronto-parietal (FP) and medial-frontal (MF) brain networks in highly experienced meditators during different meditation states (focused attention, open monitoring and loving kindness meditation). The aim was to assess whether and how the connectivity patterns of FP and MF networks are modulated by meditation style and expertise. Compared to novice meditators, (1) highly experienced meditators exhibited a strong theta synchronization of both FP and MF networks in left parietal regions in all mediation styles, and (2) only the connectivity of lateralized beta MF networks differentiated meditation styles. The connectivity of intra-hemispheric theta FP networks depended non-linearly on meditation expertise, with opposite expertise-dependent patterns found in the left and the right hemisphere. In contrast, inter-hemispheric FP connectivity in faster frequency bands (fast alpha and beta) increased linearly as a function of expertise. The results confirm that executive control systems play a major role in maintaining states of meditation. The distinctive lateralized involvement of FP and MF networks appears to represent a major functional mechanism that supports both generic and style-specific meditation states. The observed expertise-dependent effects suggest that functional plasticity within executive control networks may underpin the emergence of unique meditation states in expert meditators.

AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were (a) to examine the effects of a 6 weeks web-based mindful self-compassion program on stress and burnout symptoms in a group of practicing psychologists, and (b) to examine relationships between changes in self-compassion and self-coldness and changes in stress and burnout symptoms. Method: In a randomized controlled trial, 101 practicing psychologists were assigned to a training group (n = 51) or a wait-list control group (n = 49). The training encompassed 15 min exercises per day, 6 days a week, for 6 weeks. The participants completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) pre and post intervention. Results: Eighty-one participants (n = 40 in the training group, n = 41 in the control group) took part in the pre and post intervention assessments. Selective gains for the intervention group were observed for SCS total scores (d = 0.86; d = 0.94 for the SCS), FFMQ scores (d = 0.60), while levels of self-coldness was reduced (d = 0.73). Critically, levels of perceived stress (d = 0.59) and burnout symptoms (d = 0.44 for SMBQ total) were additionally lowered post intervention. Finally, the results confirmed the hypothesis that the measures of distress would be more strongly related to self-coldness than self-compassion, a pattern seen in cross-sectional analyses and, for burnout, also in the longitudinal analyses. Conclusions: This training program appeared effective to increase self-compassion/reduce self-coldness, and to alleviate stress and symptoms of burnout and provide support of the distinction between self-compassion and self-coldness. Additional studies, preferably three-armed RCTs with long-term follow-up, are warranted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the program.

AB  - Prisoners display significantly higher rates of mental disorders and lower mental wellbeing than the general population. The integration of positive psychological interventions in offender supervision has received recent advocacy. The aim of the current pre-post pilot study was to determine the short-term effects of group-based resilience training on mental health outcomes for female offenders and explore intervention acceptability. Offenders (n = 24) self-selected to partake in a multi-component psychological skill program based on positive psychology, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and mindfulness-based activities. The training was taught in nine sessions of 1.5 hr each. Baseline and follow-up measurements of mental wellbeing and psychological distress were collected and focus groups conducted to investigate participants' experiences, acceptability, and appropriateness of the training. Moderate to large effect sizes indicating significant improvements were observed for wellbeing, g = 0.75 and distress, g = 0.56. Training was well received by participants and staff and was delivered feasibly within the prison context. The results are encouraging, and a future well-powered study using a rigorous controlled design is warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • For the first time, we conducted a coordinates-based meta-analysis and review of functional imaging research in compassion. • From 16 studies, we identified common activation of seven regions which span frontal, salience, and midbrain regions. • Traditions in the literature consider compassion as either driven from emotion, mindset, or modulated by target characteristics or context. • We failed to identify certain regions commonly purported as relevant to compassion, likely due to studies which have utilized Loving-Kindness meditation. • We recommend future work consider clinical populations, computational methods, and measure concrete prosocial behavior. Theoretical and neurophysiological investigations into compassion are burgeoning, yet the putative neural mechanisms which underpin such processes are less well understood. Therefore, we have conducted an Activation-Likelihood Estimate meta-analysis in order to ascertain the shared neural processes consistently identified as relevant to compassion. Our analysis of sixteen fMRI studies revealed activation across seven broad regions, with the largest peaks localized to the Periaqueductal Grey, Anterior Insula, Anterior Cingulate, and Inferior Frontal Gyrus. Overall, we identified a tendency for studies to operationalize compassion in one of three ways, as driven either 'top-down', 'bottom-up', or modified by target context. We failed to identify regions purportedly common to compassion such as the DLPFC, OFC, and Amygdala, possibly due to a small number of studies which used Loving-Kindness meditation. We argue future research in compassion science continue a multi-modal approach to examine links between neural activity and actual prosocial behavior, and recommend the application of fMRI paradigms on compassion with clinically diagnosed populations to parallel current trends in psychotherapy such as Compassion Focused Therapy.

AB  - In this two-part study, we attempted to accomplish two major tasks. In Study 1, with an online sample of Christian-identifying trauma survivors (N = 257), we aimed to empirically investigate our theoretical model, anchored to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. This theoretical model suggests that negative affect mediates the relationship between Christian contentment and Christian gratitude and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other posttrauma symptoms. Based on this theoretical model, in Study 2, with a separate online sample of Christian-identifying trauma survivors (N = 26), we tested an original, online, 2-week program. Specifically, we examined the potential impact that a Christian meditative intervention, lectio divina (Latin for 'divine reading'), has on increasing Christian contentment and Christian gratitude and decreasing PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms. Study 1 results revealed that negative affect mediated the relationship between Christian contentment (but not Christian gratitude) and PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms. Study 2 results suggested that, pre- to post-intervention, the lectio divina group (n = 13) reported a greater decrease in PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms than the loving-kindness meditation control group (n = 13). These results are discussed in the context of both the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions and a growing literature on Christian-sensitive meditative alternatives to Buddhist-influenced mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation for psychological symptoms. Directions for future research and study limitations are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined cognitive distortions and coping styles as potential mediators for the effects of mindfulness meditation on anxiety, negative affect, positive affect, and hope in college students. Our pre- and postintervention design had four conditions: control, brief meditation focused on attention, brief meditation focused on loving kindness, and longer meditation combining both attentional and loving kindness aspects of mindfulness. Each group met weekly over the course of a semester. Longer combined meditation significantly reduced anxiety and negative affect and increased hope. Changes in cognitive distortions mediated intervention effects for anxiety, negative affect, and hope. Further research is needed to determine differential effects of types of meditation. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 65: 1–13, 2009. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives: This article presents a brief overview of the empirical evidence of well-established mindfulness interventions and an in-depth review of less-established compassion-based interventions (CBIs) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Definitions, cognitive and physiological mechanisms, and methods of assessment are discussed. Method: A literature review using the databases Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and PubMed was conducted. Results: Whereas the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has been documented in many trials, only seven randomized, controlled trials have been completed on CBIs and LKM. In these trials, CBIs were effective in treating psychotic disorders, affective disorders with psychotic features, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, and patients with suicide attempts in the past year; LKMwas effective in treating chronic pain; and a combination of both was effective for borderline personality disorder. A larger number of nonrandomized studies indicate that CBIs and LKMmay be effective in treating a wide range of clinical conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, chronic pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to confirm the promising effects of CBIs and LKM. Preliminary evidence suggests that both approaches might be beneficial across various clinical populations. Future studies need to clarify whether these approaches might be options as stand-alone treatments or as adjuncts or augmentation of evidence-based methods in psychotherapy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
