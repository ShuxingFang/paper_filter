TI  - A New Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Intervention Focusing on Well-Being: A Randomized Control Trial of Mindfulness-Based Positive Psychology
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

TI  - Mindfulness and Empathy: Differential Effects of Explicit and Implicit Buddhist Teachings
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several authors argue that interpersonal changes such as benevolence, compassion, and empathy should naturally emerge from a diligent practice of mindfulness. While empirical data from secularized and standardized mindfulness interventions do not fully support this assumption, a group of authors suggest that making underlying Buddhist teachings explicit within mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) might be a key factor in the modification of such culturally rooted aspects of interpersonal functioning. In order to investigate this suggestion, we compared a mindfulness program that explicitly integrates elements of Buddhist ethics (i.e., the four immeasurables) and wisdom (i.e., interdependency, non-self, common humanity) (ethics-oriented mindfulness training (EMT)), to a standard mindfulness training (SMT) program and a control group (i.e., waiting list), with a randomized controlled design in a community sample. Empathy components (i.e., affective responding, mentalization, emotion regulation, and behavioral responding), as well as variables that are typically associated with MBIs (i.e., mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being) were assessed using multi-dimensional measures (i.e., self-reported, behavioral, physiological). Results showed no overall effects on empathy of our interventions in comparison with our control group. With regard to other variables, we found specific effects for each of our interventions. Whereas SMT led to a stable increase in mindfulness (Cohen's d = .7), EMT led instead to increases in self-compassion (Cohen's d = .8) and subjective well-being (Cohen's d = .54). Although challenging theoretical expectations, we posit that our lack of empathy effects might be explained by several factors such as program structure, individual differences, and culture.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial Examining a Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Intervention that is Compatible with Confucian Values: Mindfulness-Based Positive Psychology
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) have emphasized the cultivation of ethics. However, some ethics and values that are emphasized in SG-MBIs are criticized by Confucianism, one of the most influential traditions in China. The current study developed a new SG-MBI called mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) that emphasized value clarification and integrated Confucian values. The acceptability and effects of this intervention were evaluated among Chinese people in mainland China. Methods A total of 138 healthy Chinese adults from universities and communities were randomly assigned to the MBPP or waitlist condition. Consistent with the "relief," "promotion," and "transcendence" modules in MBPP, variables representing negative symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress), positive traits (gratitude and appreciative joy), and spirituality (meaning of life) were measured before and after the 6-week intervention and 3 months after the intervention. The amount of meditation practice and ratings for MBPP and different themes were also measured. Results Compared to the waitlist condition, MBPP significantly reduced anxiety and stress with low to medium effect sizes but not other measures. The amount of meditation practice during the intervention was significantly associated with changes in appreciative joy and gratitude. Participants rated the MBPP and themes highly, and themes in the "transcendence" module received significantly lower ratings than other themes. Conclusions MBPP is a feasible and promising SG-MBI for promoting mental health among Chinese. Future studies should further evaluate the acceptability and effects of the new components of SG-MBIs and develop suitable measurements for those idealistic mentalities proposed by Buddhism and other traditions.

TI  - Mindfulness-based programs and practices for people with intellectual and developmental disability
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review People with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) commonly exhibit behaviors that present challenges to their parents, caregivers, and teachers. Mindfulness-based practices and programs have emerged as a viable alternative to current interventions for such behaviors and the stress faced by their caregivers. This review addresses publications between 2018 and 2019 that examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based practices and programs for people living with IDD. Recent findings Individuals with IDD can learn mindfulness practices to self-manage their aggressive and destructive behaviors. Individual practices and group-based programs continue to show that mindfulness approaches are effective for this population. Randomized controlled trials indicate that comprehensive mindfulness-based programs (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction, MYmind, and mindfulness-based positive behavior support) are effective for enhancing the quality of life of people living with IDD. Research supports the use of informal mindfulness practices for challenging behaviors of people with IDD. Formal mindfulness-based programs continue to be evaluated for their effectiveness across different populations, cultures, levels of IDD, components of the program, and length of training. The research literature on mindfulness is still in the early stages of development and much work remains.

TI  - Divergent effects of brief contemplative practices in response to an acute stressor: A randomized controlled trial of brief breath awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude or an attention control practice
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness practices are increasingly being utilized as a method for cultivating well-being. The term mindfulness is often used as an umbrella for a variety of different practices and many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) contain multiple styles of practice. Despite the diversity of practices within MBIs, few studies have investigated whether constituent practices produce specific effects. We randomized 156 undergraduates to one of four brief practices: breath awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude, or to an attention control condition. We assessed practice effects on affect following brief training, and effects on affect and behavior after provocation with a stressor (i.e., Cold pressor test). Results indicate that gratitude training significantly improved positive affect compared to breath awareness (d=0.58) and loving-kindness led to significantly greater reductions in implicit negative affect compared to the control condition (d= 0.59) immediately after brief practice. In spite of gains in positive affect, the gratitude group demonstrated increased reactivity to the stressor, reporting the CPT as significantly more aversive than the control condition (d=0.46) and showing significantly greater increases in negative affect compared to the breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds =0.55, 0.60, 0.65, respectively). Greater gains in implicit positive affect following gratitude training predicted decreased post-stressor likability ratings of novel neutral faces compared to breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds =- 0.39,-0.40,-0.33, respectively) as well. Moreover, the gratitude group was significantly less likely to donate time than the loving-kindness group in an ecologically valid opportunity to provide unrewarded support. These data suggest that different styles of contemplative practice may produce different effects in the context of brief, introductory practice and these differences may be heightened by stress. Implications for the study of contemplative practices are discussed.

TI  - Meditation awareness training for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention (SG-MBI) for treating fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Compared to first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, SG-MBIs are more acknowledging of the spiritual aspect of mindfulness.Design. A RCT employing intent-to-treat analysis.Methods. Adults with FMS received an 8-week SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (MAT; n = 74) or an active control intervention known as cognitive behaviour theory for groups (n = 74). Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up phases.Results. Meditation awareness training participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control group participants in FMS symptomatology, pain perception, sleep quality, psychological distress, non-attachment (to self, symptoms, and environment), and civic engagement. A mediation analysis found that (1) civic engagement partially mediated treatment effects for all outcome variables, (2) non-attachment partially mediated treatment effects for psychological distress and sleep quality, and (3) non-attachment almost fully mediated treatment effects for FMS symptomatology and pain perception. Average daily time spent in meditation was found to be a significant predictor of changes in all outcome variables.Conclusions. Meditation awareness training may be a suitable treatment for adults with FMS and appears to ameliorate FMS symptomatology and pain perception by reducing attachment to self.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial of a brief online mindfulness-based intervention
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: There is growing evidence that mindfulness has positive consequences for both psychological and physical health in both clinical and non-clinical populations. The potential benefits of mindfulness underpin a range of therapeutic intervention approaches designed to increase mindfulness in both clinical and community contexts. Self-guided mindfulness-based interventions may be a way to increase access to the benefits of mindfulness. This study explored whether a brief, online, mindfulness-based intervention can increase mindfulness and reduce perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms within a student population.Method: One hundred and four students were randomly allocated to either immediately start a two-week, self-guided, online, mindfulness-based intervention or a wait-list control. Measures of mindfulness, perceived stress and anxiety/depression were administered before and after the intervention period.Results: Intention to treat analysis identified significant group by time interactions for mindfulness skills, perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms. Participation in the intervention was associated with significant improvements in all measured domains, where no significant changes on these measures were found for the control group.Conclusions: This provides evidence in support of the feasibility and effectiveness of shorter self-guided mindfulness-based interventions. The limitations and implications of this study for clinical practice are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mindfulness and cardiovascular health: Qualitative findings on mechanisms from the mindfulness-based blood pressure reduction (MB-BP) study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mindfulness-based programs hold promise for improving cardiovascular health (e.g. physical activity, diet, blood pressure). However, despite theoretical frameworks proposed, no studies have reported qualitative findings on how study participants themselves believe mindfulness-based programs improved their cardiovascular health. With an emphasis on in-depth, open-ended investigation, qualitative methods are well suited to explore the mechanisms underlying health outcomes. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the mechanisms through which the mindfulness-based program, Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP), may influence cardiovascular health. Methods This qualitative study was conducted as part of a Stage 1 single arm trial with one-year follow-up. The MB-BP curriculum was adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to direct participants' mindfulness skills towards modifiable determinants of blood pressure. Four focus group discussions were conducted (N = 19 participants), and seven additional participants were selected for in-depth interviews. Data analysis was conducted using the standard approach of thematic analysis. Following double-coding of audio-recorded transcripts, four members of the study team engaged in an iterative process of data analysis and interpretation. Results Participants identified self-awareness, attention control, and emotion regulation as key mechanisms that led to improvements in cardiovascular health. Within these broader themes, many participants detailed a process beginning with increased self-awareness to sustain attention and regulate emotions. Many also explained that the specific relationship between self-awareness and emotion regulation enabled them to respond more skillfully to stressors. In a secondary sub-theme, participants suggested that higher self-awareness helped them engage in positive health behaviors (e.g. healthier dietary choices). Conclusion Qualitative analyses suggest that MB-BP mindfulness practices allowed participants to engage more effectively in self-regulation skills and behaviors lowering cardiovascular disease risk, which supports recent theory. Results are consistent with quantitative mechanistic findings showing emotion regulation, perceived stress, interoceptive awareness, and attention control are influenced by MB-BP.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for people living with HIV/AIDS: preliminary review of intervention trial methodologies and findings
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the management of HIV infection, the harmful effects of stress remain a significant threat. Stress may increase viral replication, suppress immune response, and impede adherence to ART. Stressful living conditions of poverty, facing a chronic life-threatening illness and stigma all exacerbate chronic stress in HIV-affected populations. Stress-reduction interventions are urgently needed for the comprehensive care of people living with HIV. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one approach that has shown promise as an intervention for patients facing other medical conditions for reducing disease progression, psychological distress and maladaptive behaviours. In this systematic review, we identified 11 studies that have examined MBSR as an intervention for HIV-positive populations. Of the studies, six were randomised designs, one was a quasi-experimental design, and the remaining four were pre- and post-test designs. The preliminary outcomes support MBSR to decrease emotional distress with mixed evidence for impact on disease progression. Effect sizes were generally small to moderate in magnitude. The early findings from this emerging literature must be considered preliminary and support moving forward with more rigorous controlled trials, evaluated with objective assessments in longer-term follow-ups to determine the efficacy of MBSR for people living with HIV.

TI  - Optimising mindfulness-based stress reduction for people with multiple sclerosis
T2  - CHRONIC ILLNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To gather views from patients with multiple sclerosis after completing a standard eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course and optimise and test a modified version as required.Methods Two successive groups of 25 multiple sclerosis patients received mindfulness-based stress reduction in a wait-list randomised controlled trial. Seventeen participants and two mindfulness-based stress reduction instructors were individually interviewed after the first (standard) course and 16 participants and the same two instructors were interviewed following the second (optimised) course. Interviews were analysed using a thematic approach.Results Mindfulness-based stress reduction was well received in both groups, with participants describing a beneficial shift in awareness. An initial (at times unpleasant) increase in awareness of disability was generally followed by greater acceptance and self-compassion. Other benefits reported included improved relationships, walking and sleep, with less stress and pain. Mindful-movement and mindful walking were problematic in group 1. This component of mindfulness-based stress reduction was simplified in group 2. A pre-course orientation session was introduced, and some organisational changes made based on feedback from group 1. Feedback from group 2 was positive in all these areas.Discussion Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears beneficial to people with multiple sclerosis, albeit mindful-movement required some modification. Contextual and organisational issues also appear important in this population.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Therapies in the Treatment of Somatization Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been used effectively to treat a variety of physical and psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Recently, several lines of research have explored the potential for mindfulness-therapy in treating somatization disorders, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome.Methods: Thirteen studies were identified as fulfilling the present criteria of employing randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy of any form of MBT in treating somatization disorders. A meta-analysis of the effects of mindfulness-based therapy on pain, symptom severity, quality of life, depression, and anxiety was performed to determine the potential of this form of treatment.Findings: While limited in power, the meta-analysis indicated a small to moderate positive effect of MBT (compared to wait-list or support group controls) in reducing pain (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.37, -0.03; p<0.05), symptom severity (SMD = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.54, -0.26; p<0.001), depression (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.40, -0.07, p<0.01), and anxiety (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.42, 0.02, p = 0.07) associated with somatization disorders, and improving quality of life (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.59; p<0.001) in patients with this disorder. Subgroup analyses indicated that the efficacy of MBT was most consistent for irritable bowel syndrome (p<0.001 for pain, symptom severity, and quality of life), and that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MCBT) were more effective than eclectic/unspecified MBT.Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that MBT may be effective in treating at least some aspects of somatization disorders. Further research is warranted.

TI  - Effect of an education and mindfulness-based physical activity intervention for the promotion of positive body image in Lithuanian female students
T2  - EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of an 8-week classroom education and mindfulness-based physical activity intervention for the promotion of positive body image in female students. Methods A quasi-experimental study was carried out with 110 Lithuanian female students (mean age 21.5 +/- 3.5, range 19-35 years). Thirty students voluntarily participated in the intervention programme and 80 students volunteered in the assessment-only control group. The intervention comprised five cognitive behavioural therapy classroom education sessions and mindfulness-based exercise (one exercise workout per week). The intervention group was evaluated with a pre-test and post-test and the control group completed measures at parallel times. Results Compared with the control group participants, the intervention group participants reported greater improvements in positive body image and a reduction in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness and internalisation of stereotyped beauty ideals, with medium to large effects. There were significant time x group interactions for pre-test to post-test changes in internalisation of beauty ideals, body area satisfaction, body dissatisfaction and body appreciation. In all cases, the interaction reflected greater pre-test to post-test changes in the intervention group compared with the control group, whose scores remained stable. A decrease in appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation, disordered eating and physical activity was observed in the control group, but the effect sizes were low. Conclusion The preliminary findings of this study support the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy methods and mindfulness-based exercise intervention aimed to promote positive body image in student-aged women. Future studies should test the efficacy of the introduced programme in larger randomised samples of young women. Level IV Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without an intervention.

TI  - Meditation awareness training for the treatment of workaholism: A controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL ADDICTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims: Workaholism is a form of behavioral addiction that can lead to reduced life and job satisfaction, anxiety, depression, burnout, work-family conflict, and impaired productivity. Given the number of people affected, there is a need for more targeted workaholism treatments. Findings from previous case studies successfully utilizing second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) for treating behavioral addiction suggest that SG-MBIs may be suitable for treating workaholism. This study conducted a controlled trial to investigate the effects of an SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (MAT) on workaholism. Methods: Male and female adults suffering from workaholism (n = 73) were allocated toMAT or a waiting-list control group. Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up phases. Results: MAT participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control-group participants in workaholism symptomatology, job satisfaction, work engagement, work duration, and psychological distress. Furthermore, compared to the control group, MAT participants demonstrated a significant reduction in hours spent working but without a decline in job performance. Discussion and conclusions: MAT may be a suitable intervention for treating workaholism. Further controlled intervention studies investigating the effects of SG-MBIs on workaholism are warranted.

TI  - Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT<SUP>®</SUP>) in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Clinical Trial Study
T2  - INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Breast cancer (BC) requires a significant psychological adaptation once treatment is finished. There is growing evidence of how compassion training enhances psychological and physical well-being, however, there are very few studies analyzing the efficacy of compassion-based Interventions on BC survivors. Objective. To study the efficacy of the Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) protocol in a BC survivor sample on quality of life, psychological well-being, fear of cancer recurrence, self-compassion, and compassion domains and mindfulness facets. Furthermore, enrollment, adherence, and satisfaction with the intervention were also analyzed. Methods. A randomized clinical trial was designed. Participants (n = 56) were randomly assigned to CBCT (n = 28) or a treatment-as-usual control group (TAU; n = 28). Pre-post intervention and 6-month follow-up measures took place to evaluate health-related quality of life, psychological well-being; psychological stress, coping strategies, and triggering cognitions; self-compassion and compassion; and mindfulness in both intervention and wait-list groups. Results. Accrual of eligible participants was high (77%), and the drop-out rate was 16%. Attendance to CBCT sessions was high and practice off sessions exceeded expectations). CBCT was effective in diminishing stress caused by FCR, fostering self-kindness and common humanity, and increasing overall self-compassion scores, mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets. Conclusion. CBCT could be considered a promising and potentially useful intervention to diminish stress caused by FCR and enhance self-kindness, common humanity, overall self-compassion, mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets. Nevertheless, future randomized trials are needed and a process of deeper cultural adaptation required.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) versus Supportive Expressive Group Therapy (SET) for distressed breast cancer survivors: evaluating mindfulness and social support as mediators
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite growing evidence in support of mindfulness as an underlying mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), it has been suggested that nonspecific therapeutic factors, such as the experience of social support, may contribute to the positive effects of MBIs. In the present study, we examined whether change in mindfulness and/or social support mediated the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) compared to another active intervention (i.e. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy (SET)), on change in mood disturbance, stress symptoms and quality of life. A secondary analysis was conducted of a multi-site randomized clinical trial investigating the impacts of MBCR and SET on distressed breast cancer survivors (MINDSET). We applied the causal steps approach with bootstrapping to test mediation, using pre- and post-intervention questionnaire data of the participants who were randomised to MBCR (n = 69) or SET (n = 70). MBCR participants improved significantly more on mood disturbance, stress symptoms and social support, but not on quality of life or mindfulness, compared to SET participants. Increased social support partially mediated the impact of MBCR versus SET on mood disturbance and stress symptoms. Because no group differences on mindfulness and quality of life were observed, no mediation analyses were performed on these variables. Findings showed that increased social support was related to more improvement in mood and stress after MBCR compared to support groups, whereas changes in mindfulness were not. This suggests a more important role for social support in enhancing outcomes in MBCR than previously thought.

TI  - A mindfulness-based, stress and coping model of craving in methamphetamine users
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in the role of mindfulness and mindfulness-based interventions to optimize recovery from a substance use disorder (SUD). However, relatively little is known about the theory-based psychological and social pathways whereby mindfulness could have beneficial effects for managing a chronic, relapsing SUD. Informed by Revised Stress and Coping Theory, the present cross-sectional study examined affective, cognitive, and social pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. A total of 161 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using sexual minority men completed a screening visit for a randomized controlled trial. Using a hybrid structural equation model, we examined pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. We found that greater mindfulness was directly associated with lower negative affect and higher positive affect as well as indirectly associated with less methamphetamine craving. Interestingly, the indirect association between mindfulness and methamphetamine craving appeared to be uniquely attributable to positive affect. Only positive affect was indirectly associated with lower methamphetamine craving via higher positive re-appraisal coping and greater self-efficacy for managing triggers for methamphetamine use. Methamphetamine craving was supported by moderate associations with greater substance use severity and more frequent methamphetamine use. These findings support the role of mindfulness in cultivating positive affect, which could be crucial to build the capacity of individuals to manage methamphetamine craving as a chronic stressor that threatens recovery from SUD.

TI  - Managers' Experiences of Meditation Awareness Training
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its potential to improve work-related stress and job performance, there is growing interest into the applications of mindfulness in the workplace setting. To date, mindfulness research within occupational psychology has mostly involved First Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (FG-MBIs). However, a growing number of researchers, clinicians, and Buddhist teachers/scholars have suggested that FG-MBIs may only partially embody the full potency of mindfulness when compared with its utilisation in traditional Buddhist practice settings. Consequently, recent years have witnessed the early stage evaluation of a number of Second Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (SG-MBIs). Although still secular, SG-MBIs are overtly spiritual in aspect and teach mindfulness within a practice infrastructure that integrates what would traditionally be deemed as prerequisites for effective spiritual and meditative development. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first qualitative investigation to analyse the experiences of employed participants receiving training in a SG-MBI. Ten participants were randomly selected from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial assessing the effects of meditation awareness training (MAT) on work-related wellbeing and job performance. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse participant experiences of MAT, and six themes emerged from the data-set: (1) changing attitudes towards work, (2) improved job performance, (3) letting go of self, (4) phenomena feed-back effect, (5) wellbeing at work and (6) taking responsibility for one's spiritual growth. Findings have important implications for the development of authentic mindfulness training programs and suggest that, compared with FG-MBIs, the SG-MBI approach may be tapping into different metacognitive resources.

AB  - ObjectivesThe aim of these two studies was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program, an 8-week workshop designed to train people to be more self-compassionate. Methods Study 1 was a pilot study that examined change scores in self-compassion, mindfulness, and various wellbeing outcomes among community adults (N = 21; mean [M] age = 51.26, 95% female). Study 2 was a randomized controlled trial that compared a treatment group (N = 25; M age = 51.21; 78% female) with a waitlist control group (N = 27; M age = 49.11; 82% female). Results Study 1 found significant pre/post gains in self-compassion, mindfulness, and various wellbeing outcomes. Study 2 found that compared with the control group, intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, and wellbeing. Gains were maintained at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Conclusions The MSC program appears to be effective at enhancing self-compassion, mindfulness, and wellbeing.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Neuroticism (Stress Vulnerability): A Pilot Randomized Study
T2  - BEHAVIOR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Neuroticism, a characteristic associated with increased stress vulnerability and the tendency to experience distress, is strongly linked to risk of different forms of psychopathology. However, there are few evidence-based interventions to target neuroticism. This pilot study investigated the efficacy and acceptability of mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with an online self-help intervention for individuals with high levels of neuroticism. The MBCT was modified to address psychological processes that are characteristic of neuroticism. Method: Participants with high levels of neuroticism were randomized to MBCT (n = 17) or an online self-help intervention (n = 17). Self-report questionnaires were administered preintervention and again at 4 weeks post-intervention. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses found that MBCT participants had significantly lower levels of neuroticism postintervention than the control group. Compared with the control group, the MBCT group also experienced significant reductions in rumination and increases in self-compassion and decentering, of which the latter two were correlated with reductions in neuroticism within the MBCT group. Low drop-out rates, high levels of adherence to home practice, and positive feedback from MBCT participants provide indications that this intervention may be an acceptable form of treatment for individuals who are vulnerable to becoming easily stressed. Conclusions: MBCT specifically modified to target neuroticism-related processes is a promising intervention for reducing neuroticism. Results support evidence suggesting neuroticism is malleable and amenable to psychological intervention. MBCT for neuroticism warrants further investigation in a larger study.

TI  - Linguistic Analysis to Assess the Effect of a Mindfulness Intervention on Self-Change for Adults in Substance Use Recovery
T2  - SUBSTANCE ABUSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Substance use is a pervasive health problem. Therapeutic community (TC) is an established substance abuse treatment but TC environments are stressful and dropout rates are high. Mindfulness-based TC (MBTC) intervention was developed to address TC stress and support self-change that could impact treatment retention. Self-change was assessed through feeling and thinking word-use in written stories of stress from 140 TC residents in a historical control group and 253 TC residents in a MBTC intervention group. Data were collected 5 times over a 9-month period. Linguistic analysis showed no differences between the groups over time; however, over all time points, the MBTC intervention group used fewer negative emotion words than the TC control group. Also, negative emotion (P < .01) and anxiety (P < .01) word-use decreased whereas positive emotion word-use increased (P < .05) over time in both groups. Descriptive data from linguistic analyses indicated that sustained self-change demands participation in mindfulness behaviors beyond the instructor-guided MBTC intervention.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for bipolar disorder: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Persisting high levels of relapse, morbidity and mortality in bipolar disorder (BD) in spite of firstline, evidence-based psychopharmacology has spurred development and research on adjunctive psychotherapies. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychotherapy that has shown benefit in related and comorbid conditions such as major depressive, anxiety, and substance disorders. Furthermore, neurocognitive studies of MBCT suggest that it may have effects on some of the theorized pathophysiological processes in BD.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using PsychINFO and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting clinical and/or neurocognitive findings for MBCT for BD.Results: This search revealed 13 articles. There was a wide range in methodological quality and most studies were underpowered or did not present power calculations. However, MBCT did not appear to precipitate mania, and there is preliminary evidence to support a positive effect on anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and broad attentional and frontal-executive control.Limitations: As meta-analysis is not yet possible due to study heterogeneity and quality, the current review is a narrative synthesis, and therefore net effects cannot be estimated.Conclusions: MBCT for BD holds promise, but more high-quality studies are needed in order to ascertain its clinical efficacy. Recommendations to address the limitations of the current research are made.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Triggers a Long-Term Shift Toward More Positive Appraisals of Emotional Ambiguity
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing negative impacts of stress, for example through mindfulness training, benefits physical and psychological well-being and is becoming ever more crucial owing to large-scale societal uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19). Whereas extensive research has focused on mindfulness-related reductions in self-reported negativity, essentially no research has targeted task-based behavioral outcomes throughout long-term mindfulness trainings. Responses to emotionally ambiguous signals (e.g., surprised expressions), which might be appraised as either positive or negative, provide a nuanced assessment of one's emotional bias across diverse contexts, offering unique leverage for assessing the effects of mindfulness. Here, we compared the effects of short- and long-term training via Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on ratings of faces with a relatively clear (angry, happy) and ambiguous (surprised) valence. Ratings became more positive for ambiguity from the start (Week 1) to end of training (Week 8; p < .001), but there were no short-term effects (from a single class session). This shift toward positivity continued through an additional 8-week follow-up (Week 16; p < .001). Notably, posttraining valence bias (Week 8) was uniquely predicted by the nonreactivity facet of mindfulness (p = .01). Together, mindfulness promotes a relatively long-lasting shift toward positivity bias, which is uniquely supported by reduced emotional reactivity.

TI  - Mindfulness Meditation for Younger Breast Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDPremenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk for psychological and behavioral disturbances after cancer treatment. Targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group.METHODSThis randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief, mindfulness-based intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress, depression, and inflammatory activity. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6-week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPS) intervention group (n=39) or to a wait-list control group (n=32). Participants completed questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes) as well as physical symptoms, cancer-related distress, and positive outcomes. Blood samples were collected to examine genomic and circulating markers of inflammation. Participants also completed questionnaires at a 3-month follow-up assessment.RESULTSIn linear mixed models, the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress (P=.004) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms (P=.094), as well as significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression (P=.009) and inflammatory signaling (P=.001) at postintervention. Improvements in secondary outcomes included reduced fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and increased peace and meaning and positive affect (P<.05 for all). Intervention effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up assessment, although reductions in cancer-related distress were observed at that assessment.CONCLUSIONSA brief, mindfulness-based intervention demonstrated preliminary short-term efficacy in reducing stress, behavioral symptoms, and proinflammatory signaling in younger breast cancer survivors. Cancer 2015;121:1231-1240. (c) 2014 American Cancer Society.Women who are diagnosed with premenopausal breast cancer report higher levels of stress, distress, and physical symptoms and are less likely to participate in support groups than older women. In this study, a mindfulness-based intervention targeted for younger breast cancer survivors has excellent adherence and leads to significant short-term reductions in stress, physical symptoms, and inflammatory activity, with longer term benefits observed for cancer-related distress.

AB  - Introduction: Recent advances in sexual health research support the benefits of mindfulness-based therapy (non-judgmental present-moment awareness) for the treatment of women's sexual dysfunction.Aim: To determine whether it is feasible to implement an adapted, empirically supported treatment protocol for female sexual dysfunction to the specific needs of men with situational erectile dysfunction (ED).Methods: A mixed-methods approach was taken for this feasibility pilot study. A total of 10 men (M-age = 40.3, SD = 14.01, Range = 20-67) with a diagnosis of situational ED were recruited to participate in a 4-week mindfulness-based treatment group. The group was adapted from protocols shown to be effective for women with sexual dysfunction and edited to include content specific to situational ED. Sessions were 2.25 hours in length, included daily home-practice activities, and integrated elements of psychoeducation, sex therapy, and mindfulness skills. Men completed questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Functioning, Relationship Assessment Scale, Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire, a treatment expectation questionnaire) at 3 time points (prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and 6 months after treatment). 5 men (Mage = 44.4, SD = 15.76, Range = 30-67) participated in qualitative exit interviews.Main Outcome Measure: Findings support the feasibility of adapting a mindfulness-based group treatment for situational ED.Results: With respect to feasibility, the dropout rate was 10%, with 1 participant who did not complete the treatment. Comparisons between Time 1 and Time 3 self-reports suggested that this treatment protocol holds promise as a novel means of impacting erectile functioning (Cohen's d = 0.63), overall sexual satisfaction (Cohen's d = 1.02), and non-judgmental observation of one's experience (Cohen's d = 0.52). Participants' expectations for the treatment were generally positive and correlated to self-reported outcomes (r =.68.73). Qualitative analyses revealed 6 themes: normalization, group magic, identification of effective treatment targets, increased self-efficacy, relationship factors, and treatment barriers.Clinical Implications: In a shift toward a biopsychosocial framework for the treatment of men's sexual dysfunction, clinicians may consider incorporating mindfulness to address psychosocial and psychosexual components of dysfunction.Strength & Limitations: This is the first study to our knowledge to adapt mindfulness protocols for use with men's sexual dysfunction. Because this is a pilot study aimed at feasibility, the sample size is small and no control group was included, thus conclusions about efficacy and generalizability cannot be made.Conclusion: The current study suggests that a mindfulness group therapy framework offers a feasible and potentially promising treatment avenue for men with situational ED.

TI  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditation: psychological interventions
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Mindfulness-based meditation interventions have become increasingly popular in contemporary psychology. Other closely related meditation practices include loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion meditation (CM), exercises oriented toward enhancing unconditional, positive emotional states of kindness and compassion. This article provides a review of the background, the techniques, and the empirical contemporary literature of LKM and CM. The literature suggests that LKM and CM are associated with an increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect. Preliminary findings from neuroendocrine studies indicate that CM may reduce stress-induced subjective distress and immune response. Neuroimaging studies suggest that LKM and CM may enhance activation of brain areas that are involved in emotional processing and empathy. Finally, preliminary intervention studies support application of these strategies in clinical populations. It is concluded that, when combined with empirically supported treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, LKM and CM may provide potentially useful strategies for targeting a variety of different psychological problems that involve interpersonal processes, such as depression, social anxiety, marital conflict, anger, and coping with the strains of long-term caregiving.

TI  - The evolutionary paths of clinical psychology studies in the United States: A bibliometrics illustration of 69k publications
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectiveWe aim to uncover the hot topics and development trends in clinical psychology research in the United States.MethodUtilizing bibliometric analysis, we examined clinical psychology papers published in the United States from 2010 to 2022 in the Web of Science database, employing citation analysis, content analysis, author analysis, and journal analysis.ResultsOur analysis revealed a significant increase in clinical psychology research, notably catalyzed by the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. This surge was particularly evident in studies addressing mental disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors, as well as psychological trauma related to issues like family conflict, elder abuse, and collective trauma. Furthermore, there was a distinct shift towards studying diverse populations, including gender and racial minorities, mothers, and adolescents. Therapeutic approaches, such as mindfulness-based practices and AI-assisted technologies, also gained prominence.ConclusionsThis study represents the first large-scale bibliometric analysis in the field of clinical psychology in the United States. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of studying psychological issues linked to major events. Also, researchers are increasingly focusing on minority groups. This trend, along with the use of new technologies like big data and artificial intelligence, guides future research in clinical psychology.Public Health Significance StatementThe works in this review suggest that the changing landscape of clinical psychology, especially post-COVID-19. The increased research post-pandemic emphasizes addressing psychological trauma arising from societal issues like family conflicts, elder abuse, and collective trauma. A positive shift towards inclusivity is evident in research, focusing on diverse groups like gender minorities, racial minorities, mothers, and adolescents. Additionally, the amplified focus on mental disorders like PTSD, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors during the pandemic stresses the need for tailored interventions and support systems. Exploring innovative methods such as mindfulness-based practices and AI-assisted technologies showcases the field's adaptability in mental health interventions.

TI  - Effects of Caregiver-Focused Programs on Psychosocial Outcomes in Caregivers of Individuals with ASD: A Meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current meta-analysis comprehensively reviewed group-design studies of interventions designed to improve ASD caregiver psychosocial outcomes and explored potential moderators of effectiveness. Forty-one unique studies targeting 1771 caregivers met inclusion criteria. Overall, the interventions had a small positive effect in improving psychosocial outcomes in caregivers of individuals with ASD (within-subjects: Hedges' g=.44; between-subjects: Hedges' g=.28). Most intervention approaches demonstrated some evidence of effectiveness. Acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and cognitive behavioral treatments demonstrated the strongest impact in improving caregiver psychosocial outcomes in pre-post comparisons. Although the results provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of caregiver-focused interventions, more studies with larger sample sizes, rigorous research designs, and long-term follow-up assessments are needed.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness, coping styles and resilience on job retention and burnout in caregivers supporting aggressive adults with developmental disabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Considering the growing body of studies investigating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on caregivers supporting people with developmental disabilities, the current study aimed to explore the role that the cognitive processes of mindfulness, coping style and resilience played in predicting caregiver retention and burnout among a sample of direct support professionals working with aggressive adults with developmental disabilities. Methods Ninety-seven direct support professionals were surveyed to determine level of mindfulness, coping styles, resilience and burnout and were interviewed 3 months later to determine if they were still working with the aggressive adult. Results Mindfulness skills of describing non-judgmentally and observing one's environment, as well as problem-focused coping, emerged as protective factors against burnout, while avoidance-focused and maladaptive coping emerged as risk factors. Mindful openness acted as the only predictor of job retention. Conclusions These results support that paid caregivers should receive trainings in mindfulness and positive coping mechanisms as part of their job trainings, to promote positive outcomes for both themselves and the people they support.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on quality of life and positive reappraisal coping among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder
T2  - RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Previous research has supported mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to enhance quality of life (QOL) in different populations, but no studies have been found to examine the effectiveness of MBIs on QOL among parents of children with ASD.Aim: The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of brief MBI on perceived QOL and positive stress reappraisal (PSR) among parents of children with ASD.Methods: A quasi-experimental, with nonequivalent control group design was used. One hundred and four parents of children with ASD were equally assigned to the intervention and control groups. The study groups were matched on measures of their gender and age, and level of severity of ASD in children. The intervention group participated in MBI program for 5 weeks, while the control group had not attended the program.Results: After the intervention program, results of paired samples t-test indicated that parents in the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in measures of psychological health domain of QOL, social health domain of QOL, mindfulness, and positive stress reappraisal with medium to large effect size (P < 0.01). The control group demonstrated improvement in measures of the dependent variables with small effect size.Conclusion: MBI is culturally adaptable, acceptable, and effective method to improve QOL and PSR in parents of children with ASD.

TI  - Longitudinal Factorial Invariance of a Brief Measure of Affect and Calm Focus.
T2  - International journal of yoga therapy
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based practices for school-aged children are increasingly common in the United States. Positive and negative affect are theoretically and empirically associated with school outcomes, and these constructs are likely to be impacted by school-based mindfulness practices. Furthermore, mindful states, such as being calm and focused, targeted by mindfulness-based practices are a potential causal mechanism to improve learning and behavior. This study describes a test of longitudinal factorial invariance for a brief measure of affect states plus a state of calm focus that is appropriate for use in mindfulness intervention studies with elementary school-aged children. Data were collected from 97 fourth-grade students in an urban elementary school that was about 46% Hispanic and 44% White. Students listened to one of six different conditions each day for 24 school days: There were four individual mindfulness modules (cross-connect, pause buttons, belly breathing, and mindful minute), one condition that included all four of the modules together, and one condition that was a control activity (a grade-appropriate story presented via audiorecording). Students provided self-report of positive and negative emotions plus calm focus immediately before and after the presentation of the audio. Results showed high levels of internal consistency for the scales, low correlations between scales, and factorial invariance in the pre- and post-test design for five of the six conditions. These findings support the use of this measure in studies with older elementary school students. Future studies should further document construct validity through external validation of the scales.

TI  - Upward Spirals of Mindfulness and Reappraisal: Testing the Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory with Autoregressive Latent Trajectory Modeling
T2  - COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The mindful reappraisal hypothesis of the Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory (Garland et al. in Psychol Inquiry 26(4):293-314, 2015a; Psychol Inquiry 26(4):377-387, 2015b) proposes that mindfulness generates eudaimonic well-being by promoting positive reappraisal, the positive psychological process through which stressful events are re-construed as benign, meaningful, or growth-promoting. To test this hypothesis, we examined prospective relations between state mindfulness and positive reappraisal in a community sample participating in a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI). At seven weekly time points throughout the MBI, participants (N = 234) engaged in a 10-min mindfulness meditation exercise at home and completed a measure of the degree of state mindfulness experienced during the meditation, as well as a measure of their use of positive reappraisal over the previous week. Support for the mindful reappraisal hypothesis of the Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory was found: in latent growth curve and multivariate autoregressive latent trajectory models, increases in the trajectory of state mindfulness experienced during meditation were significantly and robustly associated with more frequent use of positive reappraisal over the course of participation in the 8 week-long MBI. Thus, mindfulness and reappraisal may reciprocally enhance one another as interdependent components of a positive feedback loop whose structure might be best described as an upward spiral.

TI  - When you see it, let it be: Urgency, mindfulness and adolescent substance use
T2  - ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The emotion-based domains of impulsivity, positive and negative urgency, are facets that have garnered attention due to their associations with substance use, and mindfulness based strategies have shown promise in reducing substance use in adults. The aim of the current study was to examine relations among urgency, mindfulness, and substance use in adolescence. Cross-sectional data were collected from students (N = 1,051) at a large, private high school in the Pacific Northwest. Both positive and negative urgency were uniquely associated with greater likelihood of lifetime and current alcohol use; only positive urgency predicted lifetime marijuana use. Mindfulness was associated with a lower likelihood of lifetime alcohol or marijuana use. Interactions between urgency and mindfulness were not supported. Our findings highlight the need to explore relations among baseline mindfulness, skills based mindfulness, and personality in adolescent alcohol and other drug use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Mindful Approach to Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support for Veterans
T2  - DIABETES EDUCATOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility, satisfaction, and preliminary effects of Mindful Stress Reduction in Diabetes Education (Mind-STRIDE), a mindfulness-based intervention for veterans.Methods The study used a single-group pretest-posttest repeated-measures design. The 90-minute Mind-STRIDE training, adapted from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), was provided as the final component of a half-day diabetes self-management education class at a Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient diabetes clinic. Following initial training, participants were asked to practice mindfulness at home for 10 minutes each day during the 3-month study. Study recruitment and retention were calculated as rates. Veteran and diabetes educator satisfaction were assessed by rating scales and open-ended comments. Psychosocial-behavioral and metabolic outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months after initial training. Bivariate correlations were performed to describe relationships between mindfulness and other outcome variables. Gain scores and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank tests were used to assess pre to post changes; Cohen's d was applied to estimate the magnitude of effects.Results Twenty-eight of 49 eligible veterans (57%) enrolled in the study. Of those, 11 veterans (39%) demonstrated participation in home practice, and 20 veterans (71%) completed the study. Overall, participants and diabetes educators were highly satisfied with the Mind-STRIDE intervention. Significant improvements were found in diabetes distress, diabetes self-efficacy, diabetes self-management behaviors, mindful-describing, and A1C.Conclusion Results suggest feasibility, satisfaction, and positive preliminary effects. Efficacy testing by randomized controlled trial with analysis of covariance structures is warranted.

TI  - Feasibility study of a family-focused intervention to improve outcomes for children with FASD
T2  - RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Growing evidence shows that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) can benefit from interventions, and specifically interventions focused on improving self-regulation. However, novel ways of improving outcomes for children with FASD need further investigation so that programs target not only the individual child but also the family context, which includes the parent child relationship.Aims: The current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an adapted version of the Parents under Pressure (PuP) program that addresses self-regulatory processes, through improving the parent child relationship and the use of mindfulness-based strategies for both children and parents.Methods: This was a mixed methods study. Feasibility was examined by evaluating recruitment, data collection/outcome measures, and intervention procedures. The study used a phenomenological approach to obtain qualitative information from caregivers and a single-case experimental design to evaluate the preliminary participant responses to the intervention.Results: Two out of three families completed treatment. The recruitment and intervention procedures were found to be suitable for and acceptable to the families involved. Some concerns were identified regarding the outcome measures that would need to be addressed in future research. Quantitative and qualitative outcomes were positive.Conclusions and implications: The results provide preliminary support for the feasibility of an adapted version of the PuP program. Thus, offering a potential multi-component option, that aims to improve self-regulatory skills for children with FASD, through focusing on improving the parent-child relationship and incorporating mindfulness-based techniques for both parents and children.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) with Veterans: a Program Evaluation
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This pilot study explores the impact of Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) in veterans. Self-compassion, the capacity to hold one's suffering with kindness and a wish to alleviate it, is associated with improvements in well-being. Veterans have more medical conditions than non-veterans and higher prevalence rates of severe pain. Acceptability of the intervention with veterans is assessed along with the impact of MSC on the physical, mental, and social health of the participants. Methods A racially diverse, predominantly male group of veterans (n = 80) were assessed pre- and post-MSC group with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to evaluate physical, mental, and social health. Measures of self-compassion, happiness, self-report medication usage, and a global assessment of improvement measure were also included. Qualitative responses to the MSC program were also solicited and reviewed. Results Engagement with MSC was high (74% completion rate) and 96% of treatment completers rated their participation in the intervention as positive. Completers demonstrated small to medium effect size increases in self-compassion, happiness, and social role satisfaction, 95% CIs (- 6.13, - 2.65), (- 2.62, - 1.06), and (- 4.28, - 1.05), and decreases in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain interference, 95% CIs (0.44, 4.13), (0.57, 4.84), (0.43, 3.71), and (0.13, 2.70). In exploratory analyses related to pain, veterans taking pain medication reported a significant decrease in use (chi(2)(2,N = 47) = 24.30,p < .001). Conclusions These results are suggestive of the positive effects of the MSC intervention to veterans, but await a randomized controlled trial to establish its effectiveness in this population.

TI  - Cultivating Ideal Mentalities in Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions: A Feature Bringing Challenges but More Contributions
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesAs an important trend in the research on and practice of mindfulness, second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) expanded components and emphasized ethics and wisdom. The current article proposes another important feature of SG-MBIs, the cultivation of ideal mentalities, such as the nondifferential four immeasurables (i.e., equal prosocial attitudes toward different people) and mentalities of emptiness or oneness.MethodThe current article theoretically discusses and analyzes the challenges and contributions of SG-MBIs in cultivating ideal mentalities.ResultsThe new feature of SG-MBIs, cultivation of ideal mentalities, leads to five interconnected challenges for research and practice: (1) providing empirical and theoretical support for new elements; (2) matching the purposes of interventions with the needs of trainees; (3) achieving ideal mentalities during interventions; (4) assessing ideal mentalities in proper ways; and (5) clarifying the ethics and values for trainees.ConclusionsThese challenges posed by the new feature need to be discussed and addressed in the future. Nevertheless, SG-MBIs effectively embody the objectives of ideal psychology and illustrate methodological principles in research on ideal mentalities, which will benefit research on other ideal mentalities rooted in different traditions.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Smoking Cessation Enhanced With Mobile Technology (iQuit Mindfully): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness training shows promise for improving smoking cessation and lapse recovery, and between-session mobile health messages could enhance treatment engagement and effectiveness. Personalized, in-the-moment text messaging support could be particularly useful for low-income smokers with fewer smoking cessation resources.Objective: This pilot study examined the feasibility of a text messaging program (iQuit Mindfully) as an adjunct to in-person Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment (MBAT) for smoking cessation.Methods: A total of 71 participants were randomly assigned to MBAT (n=33) or iQuit Mindfully (n=38; MBAT + between-session text messages); of these, 70% (50/71) were African American, and 61% (43/71) had an annual household income of US $30,000 or less. All participants received 8 weekly therapist-led group counseling sessions, nicotine patches, and self-help materials. Outcomes were feasibility (attrition, engagement, and participants' ratings), participants' feedback regarding the text messaging intervention, and smoking cessation (assessed in person).Results: Strong retention was achieved (76% [54/71] at the end of treatment, and 89% [63/71] at 1-month follow-up). In the iQuit Mindfully group, engagement was high (88% [29/33] indicated reading all or most texts, and 89% [34/38] engaged in interactive texting), and participants provided positive ratings (on a 1-10 scale, average rating for recommending the program to others was 8.4 [SD 2.5]). Participants indicated benefiting from the texts (eg, appreciating encouraging reminders, coping strategies, and social support) and suggested improvements (eg, more personalization). Overall, biochemically confirmed smoking cessation rates were 22% (12/55) at the end of treatment and 19% (12/62) at 1-month follow-up, with no differences between conditions. Living below the poverty level predicted worse cessation outcomes at 1-month follow-up among participants receiving in-person only treatment (P=.03) but not among those receiving iQuit Mindfully.Conclusions: Text messaging appears to be a feasible and acceptable modality for supporting mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. The availability of 24/7 text messaging might be particularly helpful for low-income smokers who have access to fewer cessation resources and experience significant day-to-day barriers to quitting.

TI  - New ways of seeing and being: Evaluating an acceptance and mindfulness group for parents of young people with intellectual disabilities who display challenging behaviour.
T2  - Journal of intellectual disabilities : JOID
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The current study presents findings from an acceptance and commitment therapy-based intervention for family carers of children who have an intellectual/developmental disability and display high levels of challenging behaviour. The parent well-being workshops consist of two workshops incorporating acceptance and mindfulness-based exercises and discussions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five family carers following attendance of the workshops. Participants found the workshops useful and reported that they were better able to cope with stress. They also described how they had incorporated mindfulness into their daily lives and how their practice had had positive effects on their own well-being and on those around them (e.g. their child). Implications of the findings are discussed with emphasis on how the workshops can be included within a positive behaviour support framework. Future directions include a more robust quantitative evaluation, inclusion of follow-up sessions and the application of the workshops with other client groups and in other delivery formats.

TI  - Exploring the lived experiences of participants and facilitators of an online mindfulness program during COVID-19: a phenomenological study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has placed incredible demands on healthcare workers (HCWs) and adversely impacted their well-being. Throughout the pandemic, organizations have sought to implement brief and flexible mental health interventions to better support employees. Few studies have explored HCWs' lived experiences of participating in brief, online mindfulness programming during the pandemic using qualitative methodologies. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with HCWs and program facilitators (n = 13) who participated in an online, four-week, mindfulness-based intervention program. The goals of this study were to: (1) understand how participants experienced work during the pandemic; (2) understand how the rapid switch to online life impacted program delivery and how participants experienced the mindfulness program; and (3) describe the role of the mindfulness program in supporting participants' mental health and well-being. We utilized interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) to elucidate participants' and facilitators' rich and meaningful lived experiences and identified patterns of experiences through a cross-case analysis. This resulted in four main themes: (1) changing environments; (2) snowball of emotions; (3) connection and disconnection; and (4) striving for resilience. Findings from this study highlight strategies for organizations to create and support wellness programs for HCWs in times of public health crises. These include improving social connection in virtual care settings, providing professional development and technology training for HCWs to adapt to rapid environmental changes, and recognizing the difference between emotions and emotional states in HCWs involved in mindfulness-based programs.

TI  - Global Meditation Practices
T2  - HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Research has shown that meditation is beneficial for chronic pain, stress, and many physical and mental conditions. The definition of meditation has many forms, is culturally influenced, and is practiced globally. This literature review seeks to report current literature on meditation related to therapeutic outcomes and create a globally informed definition of meditation for health-related purposes. From a western perspective, mindfulness-based stress relief (MBSR) is widely researched. Therefore, 15 studies from peer-reviewed research from 2015 and 2020 were used to examine various forms of meditation and describe a broader range of meditation practices other than MBSR. The different forms of meditation are: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Portugal), Active Engagement (Portugal), Adapted Mindfulness Program (Brazil), Adapted Mindfulness Program (Brazil), Cognitively-based Compassionate Training, Loving-kindness (United States, US), Mantra Meditation (US), Mindfulness-based stress reduction (US), Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (South Korea), Osho (India), Psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (Italy), Transcendental Meditation (Italy), Spiritual/Secular (US), Sufi (Pakistan), and Vipassana (Australia). The review was completed using a literature search method, and all meditation approaches report positive therapeutic outcomes for all participants (n = 768). This outcome enabled the creation of a broader therapeutic definition of meditation that can be applied in clinical practice.

TI  - The benefits of meditation and mindfulness practices during times of crisis such as COVID-19
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation and mindfulness are practices that can support healthcare professionals, patients, carers and the general public during times of crisis such as the current global pandemic caused by COVID-19. While there are many forms of meditation and mindfulness, of particular interest to healthcare professionals are those with an evidence base such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Systematic reviews of such practices have shown improvements in measures of anxiety, depression and pain scores. Structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the brains of people with a long-term traditional meditation practice, and in people who have completed a MBSR programme. Mindfulness and meditation practices translate well to different populations across the lifespan and range of ability. Introducing a mindfulness and meditation practice during this pandemic has the potential to complement treatment and is a low-cost beneficial method of providing support with anxiety for all.

TI  - The effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program on stress, mindfulness self-efficacy, and positive states of mind
T2  - Stress and Health
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has grown in popularity over the last two decades, showing efficacy for a variety of health issues. In the current study, we examined the effects of an MBSR intervention on pain, positive states of mind, stress, and mindfulness self-efficacy. These measures were collected before and following an 8-week intervention. Post-intervention levels of stress were significantly lower than pre-intervention levels, while mindfulness self-efficacy and positive states of mind were at significantly higher levels. The findings underscore the potential for stress management, awareness and attention training, and positive states of mind using MBSR. Copyright Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Experiences of Clinical Clerkship Students With Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction: A Qualitative Study on Long-Term Effects
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo explore the mindfulness practice, its long-term effects, facilitators and barriers, in clinical clerkship students 2 years after participation in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training. MethodA qualitative study was performed by semi-structured in-depth interviews with 16 clinical clerkship students selected by purposive sampling. Students had participated in a MBSR training 2 years before and were asked about their current mindfulness practice, and the long-term effects of the MBSR training. Thematic analysis was conducted using the constant comparison method. Data saturation was reached after 16 interviews. ResultsMost interviewees were still engaged in regular, predominantly informal, mindfulness practice, although some discontinued mindfulness practice and reported an "unchanged lifestyle." Three main themes came forward; (1) "focused attention and open awareness" during daily activities as core elements of long-term mindfulness practice; (2) "changes in behavior and coping" that resulted from taking a pause, reflecting, recognizing automatic behavioral patterns and making space for a conscious response; (3) "integration in personal and professional life" by enhanced enjoyment of daily activities, improved work-life-balance and making different career choices. Barriers and facilitators in starting and maintaining mindfulness practice were (1) understanding and intention as "pre-conditions"; (2) practical, personal, and professional factors of students in maintaining practice. ConclusionTwo years after participation in a MBSR training, many interviewees were still engaged in (mostly informal) mindfulness practice contributing to both personal and professional changes. In light of the high clerkship demands, MBSR training could be a valuable addition to medical curricula, supporting medical students in developing necessary competencies to become well-balanced professionals.

TI  - Meditation Awareness Training for the Treatment of Sex Addiction: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL ADDICTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sex addiction is a disorder that can have serious adverse functional consequences. Treatment effectiveness research for sex addiction is currently underdeveloped, and interventions are generally based on the guidelines for treating other behavioral (as well as chemical) addictions. Consequently, there is a need to clinically evaluate tailored treatments that target the specific symptoms of sex addiction. It has been proposed that second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) may be an appropriate treatment for sex addiction because in addition to helping individuals increase perceptual distance from craving for desired objects and experiences, some SG-MBIs specifically contain meditations intended to undermine attachment to sex and/or the human body. The current study conducts the first clinical investigation into the utility of mindfulness for treating sex addiction. Case presentation: An in-depth clinical case study was conducted involving an adult male suffering from sex addiction that underwent treatment utilizing an SG-MBI known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT). Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as reductions in depression and psychological distress. The MAT intervention also led to improvements in sleep quality, job satisfaction, and non-attachment to self and experiences. Salutary outcomes were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Discussion and conclusion: The current study extends the literature exploring the applications of mindfulness for treating behavioral addiction, and findings indicate that further clinical investigation into the role of mindfulness for treating sex addiction is warranted.

T2  - ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing body of research suggests that mindfulness-based therapies may be effective in treating a variety of disorders including stress, chronic pain, depression and anxiety. However, there are few valid and reliable measures of mindfulness. Furthermore, mindfulness is often thought to be related to spirituality, given its roots in Buddhist tradition, but empirical studies on this relationship are difficult to find. The present study: (1) tested the reliability and validity of a new mindfulness measure, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), (2) explored the relationship between mindfulness and spirituality, and (3) investigated the relationship between mindfulness and/or spirituality and alcohol and tobacco use in an undergraduate college population (N= 196). Results support the reliability of the FMI and suggest that spirituality and mindfulness may be separate constructs. In addition, smoking and frequent binge-drinking were negatively correlated with spirituality scores; as spirituality scores increased the use of alcohol and tobacco decreased. Thus, spirituality may be related to decreased substance use. In contrast, a positive relationship between mindfulness and smoking/frequent bingedrinking behavior was uncovered, and warrants further investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Short-term mindful breath awareness training improves inhibitory control and response monitoring
T2  - MEDITATION
M3  - Review
CP  - International Conference on Meditation
CL  - Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci, Allahabad, INDIA
AB  - Mindfulness meditation is thought to lead to positive changes in cognitive and affective functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. One reason for this is that so far only very few studies considered the effects of specific meditation practices. We thus investigated the effects of engaging in one specific form of mindfulness meditation for a brief time period on behavioral and neural indicators of inhibitory control and metacognition. Performance on the Go/No-Go task and concurrent neural activity (EEG) was assessed before and after participants engaged in 3 weeks of mindful breath awareness meditation. Compared to a waitlist control group, meditation training enhanced the N2 event-related potential in No-Go trials and the error-related negativity (ERN) after error responses. As these two components reflect conflict and response monitoring, respectively, our results support the notion that mindfulness meditation improves metacognitive processes. The changes in the ERN were correlated with the accumulated amount of meditation time, highlighting the importance of meditation practice. Furthermore, meditation improved a behavioral marker of impulsive responding, indicating the relevance of mindfulness-based approaches for supporting health-related behaviors that are associated with deficits in impulsive control, such as substance abuse or over-eating. This study demonstrated that investigating one particular meditation practice rather than complex mindfulness-based interventions can contribute to a deeper understanding of mindfulness meditation mechanisms.

TI  - Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Delivered to Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Patients in Iran: Effects on CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T Lymphocyte Count and Medical and Psychological Symptoms
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on biological and symptomatological markers of health among human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) patients in Tehran, Iran. Methods: Using a randomized controlled trial design, data from 173 HIV+ patients (CD4 count > 250) not yet receiving antiretroviral therapy, who participated in either an 8-week MBSR (n = 87) or a brief education and support condition (n = 86) at the Imam Khomeini Hospital, were analyzed. Assessments included CD4 count, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90R), and Medical Symptom Checklist (MSCL) at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up periods. Results: The treatment-adherent sample had a mean (standard deviation) age of 35.1 (6.5) years and 69% were male. Linear mixed-model estimates indicated that, in the MBSR condition, the mean CD4 count increased from baseline up to 9 months after treatment and then returned to baseline level at 12 months. Improvements in mean SCL-90R (up to 6 months) and MSCL (up to 12 months) scores were observed for the MBSR condition, whereas education and support condition scores remained the same over time; however, only MSCL improvements significantly differed between groups and these changes lasted up to the final assessment. Conclusions: Findings suggest that among treatment-adherent Iranian HIV+ patients not yet receiving antiretroviral drug treatment, MBSR seems to have the strongest potential to improve self-reported medical symptoms.

TI  - Mindfulness-based positive psychology interventions: a systematic review
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: There are hundreds of mindfulness-based interventions in the form of structured and unstructured therapies, trainings, and meditation programs, mostly utilized in a clinical rather than a well-being perspective. The number of empirical studies on positive potentials of mindfulness is comparatively less, and their known status in academia is ambiguous. Hence, the current paper aimed to review the studies where mindfulness-based interventions had integrated positive psychology variables, in order to produce positive functioning.Methods: Data were obtained from the databases of PubMed, Scopus, and PsycNet and manual search in Google Scholar. From the 3831 articles, irrelevant or inaccessible studies were eliminated, reducing the number of final articles chosen for review to 21. Interventions that contribute to enhancement of eudaimonia, hedonia, and other positive variables are discussed.Results: Findings include the potential positive qualities of MBIs in producing specific positive outcomes within limited circumstances, and ascendancy of hedonia and other positive variables over eudaimonic enhancement.Conclusion: In conclusion, exigency of modifications in the existing MBIs to bring about exclusively positive outcomes was identified, and observed the necessity of novel interventions for eudaimonic enhancement and elevation of hedonia in a comprehensive manner.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing the Attention Training Technique and Mindful Self-Compassion for Students With Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Attention Training Technique (ATT) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) are two promising psychological interventions. ATT is a 12-min auditory exercise designed to strengthen attentional control and promote external focus of attention, while MSC uses guided meditation and exercises designed to promote self-compassion. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), a three-session intervention trial was conducted in which university students were randomly assigned to either an ATT-group (n = 40) or a MSC-group (n = 41). The students were not assessed with diagnostic interviews but had self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress. Participants listened to audiotapes of ATT or MSC before discussing in groups how to apply these principles for their everyday struggles. Participants also listened to audiotapes of ATT and MSC as homework between sessions. Participants in both groups showed significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression accompanied by significant increases in mindfulness, self-compassion, and attention flexibility post-intervention. These results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Improvement in attention flexibility was the only significant unique predictor of treatment response. The study supports the use of both ATT and MSC for students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, it suggests that symptom improvement is related to changes in attention flexibility across both theoretical frameworks. Future studies should focus on how to strengthen the ability for attention flexibility to optimize treatment for emotional disorder.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) for Mothers of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Effects on Adolescents' Behavior and Parental Stress
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some parents have to deal with the challenging behaviors of their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including aggressive and destructive behaviors. While pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been the treatments of choice, sometimes the pharmacological treatments are not very effective or the behavioral interventions are so labor intensive that parents fail to implement them consistently, thus leading to treatment failure and parental stress. In this proof-of-concept study, we assessed the effects of providing mindfulness-based positive behavior support (MBPBS) training to three mothers on the challenging and compliance behaviors of their adolescents with ASD. The MBPBS program included a series of meditations aimed at personal transformation during an 8-week program. The training in mindfulness-based practices was paired with applications to their interactions with their adolescent children using a positive behavior support model, whereby the mothers learned how to apply behavioral contingencies with intuitive awareness. Results showed that the adolescents' challenging behaviors decreased and compliance behaviors increased commensurate with the mothers' training in MBPBS. In addition, statistically significant reductions in the mothers' stress levels were correlated with the MBPBS training. These findings provide initial support for MBPBS in assisting parents to effectively manage the challenging behaviors of their children with ASD and in increasing their positive social interactions with them, but without raising their own stress levels.

TI  - The Role of Compassion and Mindfulness in Building Parental Resilience When Caring for Children With Chronic Conditions: A Conceptual Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compassion- and mindfulness-based interventions (CMBIs) and therapies hold promise to support parent resilience by enabling adaptive stress appraisal and coping, mindful parenting, and perhaps crucially, self-compassion. These contemplative modalities have recently been expanded to parents of children with chronic illness, building on successful applications for adults facing stress, chronic pain, or mental illness, and for healthcare professionals in response to caregiver burnout resulting from their work. The design and adaptation of interventions and therapies require a conceptual model of parent resilience in the context of childhood chronic illness that integrates mindfulness and compassion. The objective of this paper is to propose and describe such a model. First, we review the need for parent support interventions for this population. Second, we introduce a Model of Compassion, Mindfulness, and Resilience in Parental Caregiving. We highlight the mindful parenting approaches, guiding theories for adaptive coping, and family resilience frameworks that informed our model. Third, we describe a case of a parent to illustrate a practical application model. Finally, we outline future directions for intervention development and research to examine the impact of CMBIs on parent resilience.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Heroism: Creating Enlightened Heroes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of mindfulness and the emerging science of heroism have a common interest in the causes and conditions of selfless altruism though up to this point there has been little cross-pollination. However, there is increasing evidence that mindfulness training delivers heroically relevant qualities such as increased attentional functioning, enhanced primary sensory awareness, greater conflict monitoring, increased cognitive control, reduced fear response, and an increase in loving kindness and self-sacrificing behaviors. Predicated on the notion of a no self, traditional mindfulness and its focus on enlightenment and selfless service may in fact be ideally suited to the development of the elusive trait (predictable) versus state (intermittent) heroic character. Interweaving observations and questions drawn from the science of heroism, the article explores the relevant theory, practices, and scientific outcomes of mindfulness. It finds that there is evidence that heroically relevant qualities are trainable with the suite of mindfulness techniques and that an enduring experience of selflessness and service of others (the enlightened hero) may well be within the grasp of the serious practitioner.

TI  - The Mediating Role of Shared Flow and Perceived Emotional Synchrony on Compassion for Others in a Mindful-Dancing Program
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives While there is a growing understanding of the relationship between mindfulness and compassion, this largely relates to the form of mindfulness employed in first-generation mindfulness-based interventions such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Consequently, there is limited knowledge of the relationship between mindfulness and compassion in respect of the type of mindfulness employed in second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs), including those that employ the principle of working harmoniously as a "secular sangha." Understanding this relationship is important because research indicates that perceived emotional synchrony (PES) and shared flow-that often arise during participation in harmonized group contemplative activities-can enhance outcomes relating to compassion, subjective well-being, and group identity fusion. This pilot study analyzed the effects of participation in a mindful-dancing SG-MBI on compassion and investigated the mediating role of shared flow and PES.Methods A total of 130 participants were enrolled into the study that followed a quasi-experimental design with an intervention and control group.Results Results confirmed the salutary effect of participating in a collective mindful-dancing program, and demonstrated that shared flow and PES fully meditated the effects of collective mindfulness on the kindness and common humanity dimensions of compassion.Conclusions Further research is warranted to explore whether collective mindfulness approaches, such as mindful dancing, may be a means of enhancing compassion and subjective well-being outcomes due to the mediating role of PES and shared flow.

TI  - EMOTION DYSREGULATION MODEL OF MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS
T2  - DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - In this review, we present a transdiagnostic emotion dysregulation model of mood and anxiety disorders. This model posits that a triggering event, in conjunction with an existing diathesis, leads to negative or positive affect, depending on the person's affective style. Mood and anxiety disorders are the result of emotion dysregulation of negative affect, coupled with deficiencies in positive affect. The theoretical background of the model is discussed and a range of clinical applications of the model is described.

TI  - Efficacy of a mindful-eating programme to reduce emotional eating in patients suffering from overweight or obesity in primary care settings: a cluster-randomised trial protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Little is known about the applicability of mindfulness-based interventions in Spanish adults with overweight/obesity. The objective of the present study protocol is to describe the methods that will be used in a cluster randomised trial (CRT) that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness eating (ME) programme to reduce emotional eating (EE) in adults with overweight/ obesity in primary care (PC) settings.Methods and analysis A CRT will be conducted with approximately 76 adults with overweight/obesity from four PC health centres (dusters) in the city of Zaragoza, Spain. Health centres matched to the average per capita income of the assigned population will be randomly allocated into two groups: 'ME +treatment as usual (TAU)' and 'TAU alone'. The ME programme will be composed of seven sessions delivered by a clinical psychologist, and TAU will be offered by general practitioners. The primary outcome will be EE measured by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEN) at post test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be external and restrained eating (DEBQ), binge eating (Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh), eating disorder (Eating Attitude Test), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), mindful eating (Mindful Eating Scale), dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale). Anthropometric measures, vital signs and blood tests will be taken. A primary intention-to-treat analysis on EE will be conducted using linear mixed models. Supplementary analyses will include secondary outcomes and 1-year follow-up measures; adjusted models controlling for sex, weight status and levels of anxiety and depression; the complier average causal effect of treatment; and the clinical significance of improvements.

TI  - Group mindful self-compassion training to improve mental health outcomes for LGBTQIA plus young adults: Rationale and protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Young adults who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual and other diverse genders and sexualities (LGBTQIA+) are more likely to experience mental health difficulties and are at significantly elevated risk of substance abuse, self-harm and suicide, relative to their heterosexual, endosex and cisgender peers. There is a need for effective mental health interventions for LGBTQIA+ young adults. Mindful Self-Compassion training is a promising approach; among LGBTQIA+ individuals, self-compassion accounts for more variation in mental health outcomes than bullying, victimization, and adverse childhood experiences combined. Furthermore, LGBTQIA+ individuals with high self-compassion report more positive identity and happiness, less self-stigma, and lower suicidality than those with low self-compassion.Method: This paper outlines the rationale and protocol for a single-blind CONSORT-compliant randomised controlled trial, comparing group Mindful Self-Compassion to a delayed-treatment waitlist control group, for improving mental health, decreasing self-criticism and increasing self-compassion in LGBTQIA+ young adults (age 18-25 years). Mindful Self-Compassion training is an 8-week group program that focuses on cultivating self-compassion and mindfulness. While typically delivered as a face-to-face program, the proposed trial will investigate efficacy of the program when provided via videoconferencing.Discussion: Videoconference Mindful Self-Compassion training has the potential to improve the mental health of Australian LGBTQIA+ young adults and provide a possible cost-effective, scalable intervention for this popu-lation. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for LGBTQIA+ young adults and will provide the first data on the delivery of the program via videoconferencing.

TI  - The Effect of a Mindful Self-Compassion Intervention on Burden, Express Emotion and Mental Well-Being in Family Caregivers of Patients with Schizophrenia: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the impact of a mindful self-compassion intervention on burden, express emotion, and mental well-being in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. Standardized measures, including the ZARIT Caregiving Burden Scale, Expressed Emotion Scale and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, were administered at baseline, post-intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted to assess differences between the two groups. Significant reductions in caregiver burden, expressed emotion, and enhanced mental well-being in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention. The results of this randomized controlled trial indicate that the mindful self-compassion intervention significantly reduces caregiver burden, expressed emotion, and improves mental well-being in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. These findings underscore the potential utility of mindful self-compassion interventions as effective support for this population, highlighting the importance of integrating such interventions into caregiver support programs.

TI  - Keys to Success: Mindfulness-Based Practices in the Classroom for Stress and Anxiety in Students With Disabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION RECREATION AND DANCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, the prevalence of stress and anxiety have become exceedingly widespread, and the cumulative effects of enduring multiple ongoing stressors altering every aspect of life have left many struggling to find suitable coping mechanisms. Students, in particular, appear to be operating in perpetual states of stress and anxiety within their constantly shifting school environments. Altering routines or restricting typical activities for students with disabilities can further induce mental stress and escalate challenging behaviors that often lead to poor academic performance. Mindfulness-based practices (MBPs) are one approach that educators can use to teach students with and without disabilities how to manage everyday stressors within the academic environment in more effective ways. Understanding how MBP's can support student outcomes and best practices for meaningful participation by students with disabilities, educators can provide their students with useful strategies for managing stress and anxiety during school or in daily life. Educators can present traditional approaches, with adaptations as necessary, to facilitate simple classroom-based mindfulness activities for students with disabilities that enhance their ability to effectively navigate everyday stressors. Through relaxation training and self-management techniques, students gain tools to strengthen their emotional and psychological well-being in ways that can also enhance academic outcomes. While the practices are universal and beneficial for all students, they can be exceptionally valuable for students with disabilities. Future research should continue studying the effects of school-based mindfulness practices and strategies for implementation, especially for programs serving students with disabilities.

TI  - Mindfulness as Self-Regulated Attention Associations with Heart Rate Variability
T2  - SWISS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical research has demonstrated associations between heart rate variability (HRV) and the regulation of emotion and behavior. Similarly, self-regulation of attention to one's experience of the present moment in an accepting and nonjudgmental manner is an essential characteristic of mindfulness that promotes emotional and behavioral regulation and psychological well-being. The present study investigated the relationship between mindfulness and HRV. A total of 23 undergraduate psychology students completed a recently developed measure of mindfulness, the mindful breathing exercise (MBE), which assesses the ability to mindfully stay in contact with one's breath during breathing meditation. Moreover, indices of HRV were measured during a short version of the MBE. As predicted, positive correlations were found between indices of HRV and mindfulness. The findings demonstrate that the ability to mindfully regulate one's attention is associated with higher HRV, a physiological correlate of physical and psychological health, and therefore support on a physiological level the potential benefit of the implemented mindfulness exercises in mindfulness-based clinical interventions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCHOOL & EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was designed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a social and emotional learning (SEL) mindfulness-based school program (MindUp) for children in post-conflict Northern Uganda. In study one, we culturally adapted and implemented MindUp with 5th and 6th graders. Over a two-year period, significant decreases in children's self-reported depressive symptoms and increases in empathic concern were found. In a second, quasi-experimental study, we compared 5th and 6th graders from a school in which MindUp was implemented to children in a similar school without the program. MindUp children reported significant decreases in anger, hostility, and rejection; were reported by their teachers to be higher in positive affect and empathic behaviors; and showed greater increases in academic grades over the duration of the program in contrast to children who did not receive MindUp. These results are discussed with regard to the educational implications of the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing MindUp in other schools within Uganda and beyond.

TI  - Effects of two mindfulness based interventions on the distinct phases of the stress response across different physiological systems
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - When evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on the stress response, several aspects should be considered, such as (1) effects on various response systems, (2) temporal dynamics of the stress response, and (3) differences between programs. This study assesses the stress-attenuating effects of a standard mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and a second-generation MBI: MBSR with elements of other Buddhist practices (MBSR-B). Ninety-nine healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the MBSR, MBSR-B, or waitlist control groups and their stress response was evaluated with the Trier Social Stress Test. Changes in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathoadrenomedullary system, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and affect were measured during distinct phases of the task. Compared to waitlist control, the stress-attenuated effects of MBIs were detected across almost all systems and both negative and positive affect. In the parasympathetic branch of the ANS, the effect of MBIs was present in all stress phases (however, in the recovery phase, only MBSR-B has shown a statistically significant effect in comparison with the waitlist control). The stress-attenuating effects of MBIs were observed already in the anticipatory phase for cortisol, ANS, and negative affect (for negative affect, only the modified MBSR-B program has shown statistically significant effect in comparison with the waitlist control).

TI  - The Integration of Meditation and Positive Psychology Practices to Relieve Stress in Women Workers (Flourish): Effects in Two Pilot Studies
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation and positive psychology have been reported as promising approaches to deal with stress. This exploratory pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy of meditation and positive psychology-based intervention on stress. Two experiments are reported; in the first one, 29 healthcare professionals were included (intervention = 14; control = 15), and the second one included 57 women managers (intervention = 27; control = 30). All participants were evaluated before and after eight weeks for levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and psychiatric symptoms. In Experiment 1, intervention group participants showed a reduction in stress levels and anxiety symptoms, and in Experiment 2, participants in the intervention group showed a decrease in stress, psychiatric symptoms, and sleep quality, when compared to the control group. A multi-component intervention based on positive psychology and meditation practices was effective at reducing stress as well as improving related stress parameters such as anxiety, psychiatric symptoms, and sleep quality.

TI  - Effect of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention on Self-Compassionate Behaviors: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-compassion is regarded as a mediating or moderating variable in mindfulness-based interventions (MBI). However, few studies have investigated the role of self-compassion on MBI. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine whether (1) MBI decreases depression and trait anxiety, while increasing trait mindfulness, trait self-compassion, self-compassionate behaviors (SC behaviors), and behaviors, along with improving mood; and (2) SC behaviors moderate the effect of mindful behaviors on mood in daily life. Participants were patients with depression and/or anxiety (N=19) in Japan. Of the 27 participants recruited, 19 participated in the study. Using stratified randomization, we allocated 10 participants to the intervention group, with an 8-week standard MBI, and nine to the waitlist control group. Depression, trait anxiety, trait mindfulness, and trait self-compassion were assessed using questionnaires, while SC behaviors, mindful behaviors, and mood were measured using an ecological momentary assessment-a method used to repeatedly record events and behaviors in daily life. The results revealed that depression, trait anxiety, trait mindfulness, and trait self-compassion did not significantly change. However, SC behaviors, mindful behaviors, and mood significantly improved with MBI. Moreover, the interaction between SC behaviors and mindful behaviors was significantly shown in the pre-intervention, suggesting that SC behaviors moderate the effect of mindful behaviors on mood in daily life.

TI  - Changes in Empathy Mediate the Effects of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy but Not Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Social Anxiety Disorder
T2  - BEHAVIOR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) has been shown to be associated with difficulty in the ability to vicariously share others' positive emotions (positive affective empathy). Mixed evidence also suggests potentially impaired recognition of the positive and negative emotions of others (cognitive empathy) and impaired or enhanced sharing of the negative emotions of others (negative affective empathy). Therefore, we examined whether two efficacious treatments for SAD, cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), improve empathy in SAD relative to a wait-list condition and whether improvements in empathy mediate improvements in social anxiety. In the context of a randomized controlled trial, participants with SAD completed an empathy task at baseline, posttreatment/wait-list (N = 81), and 1-year follow-up (N = 37). Relative to both MBSR and wait-list, CBGT resulted in significant improvements in positive affective empathy. CBGT-related changes in positive affective empathy also mediated improvements in social anxiety at both posttreatment/wait-list and at 1-year follow-up. Other indices of empathy did not change differentially across the three conditions. Therefore, one way in which CBGT may specifically confer benefits to individuals with SAD is through increasing their ability or willingness to share in the positive emotions of others.

TI  - Sexual Integration Therapy: a sex-positive sexual health model supporting authentic sexual expression, while addressing sexual compulsivity, shame, fear and trauma
T2  - SEXUAL AND RELATIONSHIP THERAPY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sexual Integration Therapy (SIT) is a client-centered sexual health model that focuses on the holistic integration of authentic sexuality and pleasure. SIT prioritizes working with clients to resolve the impact of sexual shame, fear, and past traumas that interfere with pleasurable sexual expression. While some clients may find pathology or addiction-based models helpful for their sexual concerns, SIT supports those who do not find solely cognitive-behavioral pathology, nor addiction treatment models effective. Through an examination of the evolution of psychology's problematic, subjective codifications of normal versus abnormal, paraphilic, or deviant sexuality, the authors demonstrate the potential risks of diagnostic pathologization. SIT moves beyond such problematic pathology-based diagnostic models and redefines normal sexuality as uniquely personal. The authors then detail how SIT builds upon recent sexual health models to shift the therapeutic paradigm and better address individualized desires, compulsive behaviors, or inhibitions, not supported by standardized therapeutic models.Sexual Integration Therapy (SIT) is a sexual health model prioritizing authentic sexuality by addressing sex-negative beliefs, compulsions, shame, fear, or past traumas hindering pleasurable expression. The authors examine historical and contemporary drawbacks in conventional treatments, highlighting SIT's use of mindfulness models to address desires or behaviors overlooked by standard therapies.

TI  - Fear of negative and positive evaluation as mediators and moderators of treatment outcome in social anxiety disorder
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Elevated fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive evaluation (FPE) are thought to play key roles in the maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although efficacious therapies exist for SAD, the potential mediating and moderating effects of FNE and FPE on social anxiety treatment outcome have not been examined. Methods: This sample comprised a secondary analysis of 210 individuals who participated in one of three randomized controlled trials for the treatment of SAD. Participants were randomized to: individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), group CBT, community mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), group MBSR, or they were randomized to waitlist and offered treatment after waitlist. Assessments were completed pre- and posttreatment/waitlist and, for the treatment groups, at three-month follow-up. Results: CBT and MBSR led to greater reductions in FNE and FPE than waitlist, with CBT more efficacious in reducing FPE than MBSR. For both CBT (vs. waitlist) and MBSR (vs. waitlist), there were significant indirect effects on post-treatment social anxiety through both FNE and FPE, and the indirect effect through FPE was greater for CBT than MBSR. However, in the fully longitudinal model testing mediation, CBT and MBSR were not differentially mediated by FPE. Baseline FNE and FPE each moderated CBT treatment outcome compared to waitlist - higher baseline FNE and FPE were associated with higher baseline social anxiety and greater reductions in social anxiety during CBT. Discussion: FNE and FPE contributed in sometimes similar and sometimes distinct ways to the mediation and moderation of psychosocial approaches for treating SAD. This supports the importance of distinguishing between fears of negative and positive evaluation in the assessment and treatment of SAD.

TI  - MINDFULNESS AND RUMINATION: DOES MINDFULNESS TRAINING LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN THE RUMINATIVE THINKING ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSION?
T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1982, 1990) training on a self-selected adult community sample in the areas of mindfulness, rumination, depressive symptomatology and overall well-being. Targeting rumination was considered particularly important because a tendency toward rumination in nondepressed populations has been found to be predictive of subsequent onset of depression. As hypothesized, completers of the MBSR class showed increases in mindfulness and overall wellbeing, and decreases in rumination and symptoms of depression. Limitations of the study are discussed, as are the implications of these findings.

TI  - Kindness Matters: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mindful Self-Compassion Intervention Improves Depression, Distress, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> Among Patients With Diabetes
T2  - DIABETES CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVEMood difficulties are common among patients with diabetes and are linked to poor blood glucose control and increased complications. Evidence on psychological treatments that improve both mood and metabolic outcomes is limited. Greater self-compassion predicts better mental and physical health in both healthy and chronically ill populations. Thus, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the effects of self-compassion training on mood and metabolic outcomes among patients with diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis RCT tested the effects of a standardized 8-week mindful self-compassion (MSC) program (n = 32) relative to a wait-list control condition (n = 31) among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Measures of self-compassion, depressive symptoms, diabetes-specific distress, and HbA(1c) were taken at baseline (preintervention), at week 8 (postintervention), and at 3-month follow-up.RESULTSRepeated-measures ANOVA using intention to treat showed that MSC training increased self-compassion and produced statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression and diabetes distress in the intervention group, with results maintained at 3-month follow-up. MSC participants also averaged a clinically and statistically meaningful decrease in HbA(1c) between baseline and follow-up of >10 mmol/mol (nearly 1%). There were no overall changes for the wait-list control group.CONCLUSIONSThis initial report suggests that learning to be kinder to oneself (rather than being harshly self-critical) may have both emotional and metabolic benefits among patients with diabetes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program is an empirically-developed group intervention aimed to cultivate self-compassion.Sample and setting. A randomized control trial was conducted with pre-, post-measurements, and two-month follow-up. A total of 122 participants were recruited from a general community by convenience sampling. They were randomly allocated to the Compassionate intervention (CI) based on MSC and to a control condition with no treatment.Hypotheses. The authors hypothesised that participation in the CI based on the MSC would decrease self-criticism and increase self-reassurance and self-compassion.Statistical analysis. SPSS Statistics-20, program R, and the package nparLD for the statistical analysis. Non-parametric rank-based test for longitudinal data (pretest-postest design) was employed.Results. This version of the CI based on the MSC significantly increased levels of self-compassion and self-reassurance as reported immediately post intervention and at two-month follow-up. The CI based on the MSC was also effective at reducing self-uncompassionate responding, which was only present immediately post intervention. Self-compassion is responsive to improvement following a short-term online intervention of CI based on the MSC which suggests that interventions designed to increase self-compassion can be provided online to broader populations without direct involvement of mental health professionals.Study limitation. Participants allocated to the CI were not exposed to the full experience of the MSC but only to a selected number of exercises from the MSC program.

TI  - Philosophy for children and mindfulness during COVID-19: Results from a randomized cluster trial and impact on mental health in elementary school students
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on children's mental health. Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard.Objective: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN).Results: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention.Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted.Public significance: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context.Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.

TI  - Collaborative Care and Related Interventions in Patients With Heart Disease: An Update and New Directions
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, are very common in cardiac patients and are independently linked to adverse cardiac outcomes, including mortality. Collaborative care and other integrated care models have been used successfully to manage psychiatric conditions in patients with heart disease, with beneficial effects on function and other outcomes. Novel programs using remote delivery of mental health interventions and promotion of psychological well-being may play an increasingly large role in supporting cardiovascular health. Methods: We review prior studies of standard and expanded integrated care programs among patients with cardiac disease, examine contemporary intervention delivery methods (e.g., Internet or mobile phone) that could be adapted for these programs, and outline mental health-related interventions to promote healthy behaviors and overall recovery across all cardiac patients. Results: Standard integrated care models for mental health disorders are effective at improving mood, anxiety, and function in patients with heart disease. Novel, "blended" collaborative care models may have even greater promise in improving cardiac outcomes, and interfacing with cardiac patients via mobile applications, text messages, and video visits may provide additional benefit. A variety of newer interventions using stress management, mindfulness, or positive psychology have shown promising effects on mental health, health behaviors, and overall cardiac outcomes. Conclusions: Further study of novel applications of collaborative care and related interventions is warranted given the potential of these programs to increase the reach and effect of mental health interventions in patients with heart disease.

Child-and parent-completed measures were collected at baseline and 8 and 12 weeks later. Measures included the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI), the Fibromyalgia/Symptom Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR/SIQR), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (MASC2), and the Perceived Stress Scale. Subjects and parents were interviewed following the program to assess feasibility.Results Fifteen of 18 subjects (83%) completed the 8-week program. No adverse events occurred. Compared with baseline scores, significant changes were found in mean scores on the FDI (33% improvement, P = .026), FIQR/SIQR (26% improvement, P = .03), and MASC2 (child: 12% improvement, P = .02; parent report: 17% improvement, P = .03) at 8 weeks. MASC2 scores (child and parent) and Perceived Stress Scale scores were significantly improved at 12 weeks. More time spent doing home practice was associated with better outcomes in the FDI and FIQR/SIQR (44% and 26% improvement, respectively). Qualitative interviews indicated that subjects and parents reported social support as a benefit of the MBSR class, as well as a positive impact of MBSR on activities of daily living, and on pain and anxiety.Conclusions MBSR is a feasible and acceptable intervention in adolescents with functional somatic syndromes and has preliminary evidence for improving functional disability, symptom impact, and anxiety, with consistency between parent and child measures.

TI  - Exploring perceptions about Mindfulness and Mindful Eating Programs for low-income women with overweight in primary health care
T2  - NUTRITION AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Obesity and overweight are public health problems of multifactorial etiology, aggravated by the challenge that is maintaining weight loss. Used in the context of general health, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have also showed positive effects when targeting changes to overweight-related eating behaviors. Methods: This study consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted with 284 women from primary health care units. Data were collected from the last session with 16 focus groups, considering each intervention group (mindfulness or mindful eating) Aim: This article aims to present the perceptions of low-income overweight women who participated in Mindfulness and Mindful Eating intervention groups in primary health care according to each type of intervention. Results: Seven themes were identified: course challenges; valorization of the teacher's attitudes; mindfulness understanding; self-awareness development; change of expectations; development of a different food-weight relationship; and discover of a wide range of benefits. Conclusion: Mindfulness and Mindful eating interventions affect not only an individual's relationship with body and food, but also life and human relations. The results indicate the feasibility of the intervention, which addresses a large number of patients who lack treatment options for overweight or emotional and psychological issues associated with this condition. MBIs such as mindful eating are applicable in primary health care facilities, targeting overweight women and supporting treatment by addressing a repressed demand in the system. Similar to mind-body therapies, these interventions allow for comprehensive care.

TI  - Mindfulness training as an intervention for fibromyalgia: Evidence of postintervention and 3-year follow-up benefits in well-being
T2  - PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR) proposes a systematic program for reduction of suffering associated with a wide range of medical conditions. Studies suggest improvements in general aspects of well-being, including quality of life ( QoL), coping and positive affect, as well as decreased anxiety and depression. Methods: A quasi-experimental study examined effects of an 8-week MBSR intervention among 58 female patients with fibromyalgia ( mean, 52 +/- 8 years) who underwent MBSR or an active social support procedure. Participants were assigned to groups by date of entry, and 6 subjects dropped out during the study. Self-report measures were validated German inventories and included the following scales: visual analog pain, pain perception, coping with pain, a symptom checklist and QoL. Pre- and postintervention measurements were made. Additionally, a 3-year follow-up was carried out on a subgroup of 26 participants. Results: Pre- to postintervention analyses indicated MBSR to provide significantly greater benefits than the control intervention on most dimensions, including visual analog pain, QoL subscales, coping with pain, anxiety, depression and somatic complaints ( Cohen d effect size, 0.40-1.10). Three-year follow-up analyses of MBSR participants indicated sustained benefits for these same measures ( effect size, 0.50-0.65). Conclusions: Based upon a quasi-randomized trial and long-term observational follow-up, results indicate mindfulness intervention to be of potential long-term benefit for female fibromyalgia patients.

TI  - Phenomenological Fingerprints of Four Meditations: Differential State Changes in Affect, Mind-Wandering, Meta-Cognition, and Interoception Before and After Daily Practice Across 9 Months of Training
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing interest in the effects of mental training practices such as meditation, there is much ambiguity regarding whether and to what extent the various types of mental practice have differential effects on psychological change. To address this gap, we compare the effects of four common meditation practices on measures of state change in affect, mind-wandering, meta-cognition, and interoception. In the context of a 9-month mental training program called the ReSource Project, 229 mid-life adults (mean age 41) provided daily reports before and after meditation practice. Participants received training in the following three successive modules: the first module (presence) included breathing meditation and body scan, the second (affect) included loving-kindness meditation, and the third (perspective) included observing-thought meditation. Using multilevel modeling, we found that body scan led to the greatest state increase in interoceptive awareness and the greatest decrease in thought content, loving-kindness meditation led to the greatest increase in feelings of warmth and positive thoughts about others, and observing-thought meditation led to the greatest increase in meta-cognitive awareness. All practices, including breathing meditation, increased positivity of affect, energy, and present focus and decreased thought distraction. Complementary network analysis of intervariate relationships revealed distinct phenomenological clusters of psychological change congruent with the content of each practice. These findings together suggest that although different meditation practices may have common beneficial effects, each practice can also be characterized by a distinct short-term psychological fingerprint, the latter having important implications for the use of meditative practices in different intervention contexts and with different populations.

TI  - Mindfulness significantly reduces self-reported levels of anxiety and depression: Results of a randomised controlled trial among 336 Danish women treated for stage I-III breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: As the incidence of and survival from breast cancer continue to raise, interventions to reduce anxiety and depression before, during and after treatment are needed. Previous studies have reported positive effects of a structured 8-week group mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) among patients with cancer and other conditions.Purpose: To test the effect of such a programme on anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer in a population-based randomised controlled study. Methods: A total of 336 women who had been operated on for breast cancer (stage I-III) were randomised to usual care or MBSR + usual care. Questionnaires including the Symptom Checklist-90r anxiety and depression subscales and the Center for Epidemiological StudiesDepression scale were administered before randomisation and immediately, 6 and 12 months after the intervention.Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed differences between groups in levels of anxiety (p = 0.0002) and depression (SCL-90r, p < 0.0001; CES-D, p = 0.0367) after 12 months. Graphical comparisons of participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline showed a significantly greater decrease in the intervention group throughout follow-up and no differences among least affected participants. Medium-to-large effects were found for all outcomes in the intervention group in analyses of change scores after 12 months' follow-up.Conclusion: The 8-week group based MBSR intervention had clinically meaningful, statistically significant effects on depression and anxiety after 12 months' follow-up, and mediumto- large effect sizes. Our findings support the dissemination of MBSR among women with breast cancer. (Clintrials. gov No.: NCT00990977). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Self-Structure in Persecutory Delusions
T2  - BEHAVIOR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is currently limited research examining self-structure in clinical groups and no current data on the extent to which self-structure is amendable to change following psy-chological therapy. We address this important gap by examining self-structure in individuals with persecutory delusions using the card sort task, an established paradigm measuring key self-structure indices, including the degree to which self-structure is compartmentalized (characterized by primarily positive or negative attributes, as opposed to a mix of both), and the proportion and importance of nega-tive attributes. In Study 1, individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum diag-nosis with current persecutory delusions (clinical group, n = 27) and a healthy control group (n = 47) were com-pared on self-structure indices. In Study 2 (n = 27), the clin-ical group also completed the card sort task before and after randomization to either a 12-week mindfulness -based psychological therapy or treatment-as-usual control. In Study 1, self-structure differed significantly between the clinical and control groups. The clinical group had a greater proportion of negative attributes, assigned more importance to negative self-aspects, and had more com-partmentalized self-structures compared with controls. In Study 2 there were no associations between delusion sever-ity and self-structure. Large effect sizes for reductions in compartmentalization and proportion of negative attri-butes across self-aspects were found following mindfulness therapy. The findings highlight key differences in self -structure between individuals with persecutory delusions and healthy controls, and suggest that it might be possible to change self-structure following psychological therapy. These data support the central role of the self in theoretical models of paranoid thinking.

TI  - Efficacy of Psychosocial Interventions on Psychological and Physical Health Outcomes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Psychosocial intervention has been suggested as a potentially effective supplement to medical treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no reviews so far have quantified the existing research in terms of both psychological and physical health outcomes. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials evaluating the effects of psychosocial interventions on psychological and physical health outcomes in COPD. Methods: Two independent raters screened 1,491 references for eligibility. Twenty independent studies investigating a total of 1,361 patients were included, assessed for their methodological quality, and subjected to meta-analytic evaluation. Results: After adjusting for potential publication bias, a statistically significant overall effect was found for psychological (Hedges' g = 0.38, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.19-0.58; p < 0.001) outcomes. When analyzing individual intervention types, cognitive behavioral therapy appeared to be effective (g = 0.39, CI = 0.15-0.62; p = 0.001) for improving psychological outcomes. In contrast, for physical outcomes, only mind-body interventions (e.g. mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, and relaxation) revealed a statistically significant effect (g = 0.40; CI = 0.01-0.79; p = 0.042). Conclusions: Taken together, the results lend support to psychosocial intervention as a tool in the management of COPD. However, due to indications of possible publication bias towards positive findings, the results should be interpreted with some caution, and more high quality research is needed. (C) 2014 S.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPNOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of the novel intervention mindful hypnotherapy on depression, self-compassion, and psychological inflexibility in females with major depressive disorder was examined in a randomized, clinical trial. Thirty-four participants were randomly allocated into mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups. The intervention group was treated in 8 face-to-face, 60-minute weekly therapy sessions along with mindful hypnosis audio tapes to be used daily. The results of analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences between the mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups after intervention and at 2-month follow-up (p < .001). The between-subject test of repeated measures ANOVAs also indicated a clinically significant difference between groups across time (baseline, postintervention, and 2-month follow-up) in depression, F = 53.86, p < .001, effect size = .65, and in self-compassion, F = 33.18, p < .001, effect size = .53, as well as psychological inflexibility, F = 26.84, p < .001, effect size = .48. In conclusion, this study indicates that mindful hypnotherapy is an effective intervention for treating depression as well as reducing psychological inflexibility and improving self-compassion for patients with major depressive disorder.

TI  - Developmental changes in mindful awareness during adolescence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite abundant research on the benefits of dispositional mindfulness and mindfulness-based interventions, little is known about the naturally occurring developmental course of mindful awareness. Given dramatic strides during adolescence in competencies that may support mindfulness (e.g., emotion regulation), the high school years are a suitable window to study developmental changes in mindfulness. Using an accelerated cohort design to examine the longitudinal trajectory of mindfulness from 9th grade through 12th grade, we employed data from a 5-year study of 3,453 U.S. adolescents (55% female; 40% Latinx, 38% White, 13% Black, and 7% Asian) from high schools in three geographical regions in the U.S. Adolescents annually completed self-report surveys measuring mindful awareness and several internal and external factors. Latent growth curve analyses found that, after controlling for cohort, there was no average linear change in mindful awareness from grades 9 through 12, although there was significant interindividual variability in slopes. Within-person analyses found that in grades when needs-supportive climate was higher and discrimination was lower, adolescents reported greater mindful awareness. Unexpectedly, in grades when perspective taking and prosocial behaviors were higher, mindfulness was lower. These findings inform developmental understanding of mindful awareness and the ways that it naturally occurs and is supported during adolescence.

TI  - Internet-Based Instructor-Led Mindfulness for Work-Related Rumination, Fatigue, and Sleep: Assessing Facets of Mindfulness as Mechanisms of Change. A Randomized Waitlist Control Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to extend our theoretical understanding of how mindfulness-based interventions exert their positive influence on measures of occupational health. Employing a randomized waitlist control study design, we sought to (a) assess an Internet-based instructor-led mindfulness intervention for its effect on key factors associated with "recovery from work," specifically, work-related rumination, fatigue, and sleep quality; (b) assess different facets of mindfulness (acting with awareness, describing, nonjudging, and nonreacting) as mechanisms of change; and (c) assess whether the effect of the intervention was maintained over time by following up our participants after 3 and 6 months. Participants who completed the mindfulness intervention (n = 60) reported significantly lower levels of work-related rumination and fatigue, and significantly higher levels of sleep quality, when compared with waitlist control participants (n = 58). Effects of the intervention were maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up with medium to large effect sizes. The effect of the intervention was primarily explained by increased levels of only 1 facet of mindfulness (acting with awareness). This study provides support for online mindfulness interventions to aid recovery from work and furthers our understanding with regard to how mindfulness interventions exert their positive effects.

TI  - Mindful Climate Action: Health and Environmental Co-Benefits from Mindfulness-Based Behavioral Training
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gases from human activities are causing climate change, creating risks for people around the globe. Behaviors involving transportation, diet, energy use, and purchasing drive greenhouse gas emissions, but are also related to health and well-being, providing opportunity for co-benefits. Replacing shorter automobile trips with walking or cycling, or eating plants rather than animals, for example, may increase personal health, while also reducing environmental impact. Mindfulness-based practices have been shown to enhance a variety of health outcomes, but have not been adapted towards environmental purposes. We designed the Mindful Climate Action (MCA) curriculum to help people improve their health while simultaneously lowering their carbon footprints. Combining mindfulness-based practices with the Stages of Change theory, the MCA program aims to: (1) improve personal health and well-being; (2) decrease energy use; (3) reduce automobile use; (4) increase active transport; (5) shift diet towards plant-based foods; and (6) reduce unnecessary purchasing. Mindfulness practices will foster attentional awareness, openness, and response flexibility, supporting positive behavior change. We plan to test MCA in a randomized controlled trial, with rigorous assessment of targeted outcomes. Our long-term goal is to refine and adapt the MCA program to a variety of audiences, in order to enhance public health and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Boosting Psychological Well-Being through a Social Mindfulness-Based Intervention in the General Population
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefits of mindfulness meditation among clinical and non-clinical populations have been largely reported in literature. Existing mindfulness-based programs are particularly useful in targeting specific populations while researchers have pointed out the possibility of developing programs adapted to the audience and the context. In this two-groups pre-post experimental design we developed a mindfulness-based social intervention program to target individuals from the general population. Here we present a two-groups pre-post experimental design to investigate its effectiveness on participants' psychological functioning assessed by eight self-reported questionnaires (CORE-OM, FFMQ, SWLS, PANAS, PSS, SCS, WEMWBS, SHS) which encompass different domains of well-being, mindfulness and emotional functioning. Participants, recruited on voluntary basis, were randomly allocated to treated or passive control groups and were aware of group allocation. The intervention comprises a 12-week meditation training in a big group that represents the social aspect of meditation. Data were analysed via a linear mixed effect model and intention to treat. Statistically significant results were obtained for global score of CORE-OM (beta = -0.20 [-0.30; -0.10], p = 0.0002), FFMQ (beta = 0.20 [0.12; -0.28], p < 0.0001), SWLS (beta = 1.43 [0.42; 2.45], p = 0.006), positive PANAS (beta = 1.99 [0.95; 3.04], p = 0.0002), negative PANAS (beta = -1.67 [-2.92; -0.43], p = 0.009), PSS (beta = -2.98 [-4.25; -1.71], p < 0.0001), WEMWBS (beta = 4.38 [2.93; 5.83], p < 0.0001) and SHS (beta = 1.43 [0.42; 2.45], p = 0.006). Our intervention is causally associated with an improvement of the psychological functioning and hence can be considered as a preventive measure that may potentially reduce the risk of developing psychological problems and improve the subject's general well-being. Given the voluntary recruitment, our inference only applies to those individuals who have decided to experience meditation as a way to well-being and not to a random person from the general population.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Effects of Meditation on Empathy, Compassion, and Prosocial Behaviors
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Review
AB  - Increased attention has focused on methods to increase empathy, compassion, and prosocial behavior. Meditation practices have traditionally been used to cultivate prosocial outcomes, and recently investigations have sought to evaluate their efficacy for these outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of meditation for prosocial emotions and behavior. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane databases (inception to April 2016) using the following search terms: mindfulness, meditation, mind-body therapies, tai chi, yoga, MBSR, MBCT, empathy, compassion, love, altruism, sympathy, or kindness. Randomized controlled trials in any population were included (26 studies with 1714 subjects). Most were conducted among healthy adults (n = 11) using compassion or loving kindness meditation (n = 18) over 8-12 weeks (n = 12) in a group format (n = 17). Most control groups were wait-list or no treatment (n = 15). Outcome measures included self-reported emotions (e.g., composite scores, validated measures) and observed behavioral outcomes (e.g., helping behavior in real-world and simulated settings). Many studies showed a low risk of bias. Results demonstrated small to medium effects of meditation on self-reported (SMD = .40, p < .001) and observable outcomes (SMD = .45, p < .001) and suggest psychosocial and neurophysiological mechanisms of action. Subgroup analyses also supported small to medium effects of meditation even when compared to active control groups. Clinicians and meditation teachers should be aware that meditation can improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors.

TI  - Psychometric Properties of the Greek Versions of the Self-Compassion and Mindful Attention and Awareness Scales
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to adapt the Self-Compassion Scale and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale into Greek. Self-compassion and mindfulness are increasingly used in current research and therapy, but not in Greece. This research is the first step toward achieving the expansion of mindfulness and self-compassion research in Greece. In four studies (N=1,364), this paper evaluated the psychometric properties of the Self-Compassion Scale-Greek and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Greek. Exploratory factor analyses, as well as internal consistency and test-retest analyses, were conducted. Results of the four studies confirmed that (a) the translated versions are equivalent to the original, (b) factor analyses established similar factor solutions to the English versions, (c) reliability coefficients are satisfactory (i.e., Cronbach's a coefficients and test-retests), and (d) construct validity revealed similarities between English and Greek versions, replications consistent with past research, as well as differences explained through theoretical frameworks. Therefore, both scales were accepted as valid and reliable measures for assessing self-compassion and mindfulness in Greek-speaking populations.

TI  - The Feasibility of Bringing Brief Mindfulness-Based Training to the University Classroom
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness has been promoted as a way to increase resiliency during times of stress. Universities are reporting that record numbers of undergraduate students are seeking mental health services related to stress. This study assessed the feasibility of layering brief mindfulness-based practice within a large-scale university course. Data were collected from 115 participants enrolled in a third-year psychology course. The intervention took approximately 5 min of the 80-min class time on alternating course days, resulting in no deleterious effects on learning outcomes. 53.6% of the students indicated that they had used the practice outside of class, possibly leading to long-term positive effects in multiple areas. One-fifth of students reported seeking out other opportunities to learn about mindfulness in the same semester. Participants reported increased stress and decreased mindfulness over the course of the study, which corresponded to the assessment points within the semester, but may also highlight the impact of mindfulness training on awareness of both positive and negative emotional states. Future research should consider the role of brief mindfulness interventions in stress reduction, anxiety reduction, overall coping, and academic engagement in the undergraduate large-class environment.

TI  - Mindfulness and Perceptions of Physical Health: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DU COMPORTEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness, the ability to attend to present-moment thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental manner, is associated with a variety of positive health outcomes. In previous research, self-perceived stress mediated the relationship between mindfulness and physical health perceptions, a finding consistent with the Mindfulness Stress Buffering Account. To extend this research, we examined how five facets of mindfulness were related to self-perceived stress and self-reported physical health. We distributed an electronic survey assessing mindfulness, self-perceived stress, and self-reported physical health to 242 undergraduate students. Using regression analyses, we found that for four of five mindfulness factors, self-perceived stress mediated the relationship between mindfulness and self-reported physical health. An examination of effect sizes revealed that the nonjudging mindfulness factor had the strongest relationship with self-reported physical health. These results support the Mindfulness Stress Buffering Account, and extend previous work on the subject by considering specific facets of mindfulness.

TI  - Brief breath awareness training yields poorer working memory performance in the context of acute stress
T2  - COGNITION & EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions that span multiple sessions over time appear to confer psychological benefits. However, the effects of brief periods of mindfulness meditation training are less clear, particularly on measures of cognitive functioning. This study assessed whether brief mindfulness practice (breath awareness) or training in two other contemplative practices - loving-kindness and gratitude - differentially impact working memory performance following acute physiological stress relative to an attentional control. Participants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to one of four training groups and completed the automated Operation Span (OSPAN) task pre-training and again after undergoing the cold pressor task. Three of the four groups improved in OSPAN performance, with loving-kindness, gratitude, and attentional control conditions showing increases in OSPAN relative to breath awareness. Changes in OSPAN were not correlated with changes in positive or negative affect. It appears that brief breath awareness training may not effectively buffer against acute stress in this predominantly meditation naive sample and may in fact impair subsequent cognitive performance relative to a control or other contemplative practices. A granular approach is warranted to understand potentially distinct and contextually variable effects of different contemplative practices. Implications are discussed in light of the stress buffering hypothesis and Monitor and Acceptance Theory.

TI  - The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Sexual Counseling on Sexual Distress, Attitude Toward Sexuality, and Body Image Concerns in Pregnant Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSexual distress during pregnancy can cause a negative attitude toward sexuality during pregnancy, and this can be seen especially in conjunction with body image concerns. This study was conducted to determine the effects of mindfulness-based sexual counseling (MBSC) on sexual distress, attitudes toward sexuality, and body image concerns in pregnant women. MethodsA randomized controlled trial was conducted in a sample of women who experienced sexual distress presenting to a Healthy Living Center in eastern Turkey. Women (N = 134) were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week, 8-session counseling program based on mindfulness (experimental group; n = 67) or treatment as usual (control group; n = 67). The primary outcome of the study, sexual distress, was assessed using the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised. Secondary outcomes included attitude toward sexuality, assessed using the Attitude Scale toward Sexuality during Pregnancy, and body image concerns, using the Body Image Concerns during Pregnancy Scale. Outcomes were compared postintervention, correcting for baseline using analysis of covariance. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04900194). ResultsMean scores for sexual distress (7.69 vs 17.36; P < .001) and body image concerns (57.76 vs 73.88; P < .001) decreased significantly in the mindfulness group compared with the control group. Similarly, mean scores for attitudes toward sexuality significantly improved in the mindfulness group compared with the control group (133.52 vs 105.78; P < .05). DiscussionMBSC is a promising strategy to help women experiencing sexual distress during pregnancy to reduce their levels of sexual distress, raise their positive attitudes toward sexuality, and lower their body image concerns. Larger clinical trials of MBSC are recommended to support introduction of MBSC into clinical practice.

TI  - Reducing parenting stress in Chinese parents of children with learning disabilities with a mindful parenting program: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Parents raising children with Learning Disabilities (LDs) often face multiple challenges and high levels of parenting stress, especially in societies with intense academic competitions. Mindful parenting (MP) is an emerging approach that brings mindful awareness to parent-child interactions and is found effective in reducing parenting stress in various parent populations. Aims: This study examined the effectivenesss of an 8-week online MP program on Chinese parents of children with LDs. Methods and procedures: A MP program was adapted and implemented in an online format with 69 parents of children with LDs. A randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the efficacy of the mindful parenting group compared with a wait-list control group. Parenting stress, mindful parenting and self-compassion were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Outcomes and results: Compared with the wait-list control group, the MP group participants showed decreased parenting stress (d = 0.62, p < 0.05), improved mindful parenting (d = 0.63, p < 0.05), and increased self-compassion (d = 0.61, p < 0.05). Conclusions and implications: These findings support the effectiveness of an online MP intervention in reducing parenting stress and increasing mindful parenting and self-compassion among Chinese parents of children with LDs. The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, whereas the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects, particularly non-judgmental acceptance and compassion towards the child, are resistant to change. Future studies should explore strategies to enhance these attitudinal aspects and interpersonal processes of MP.

TI  - Internalized weight stigma in women with class III obesity: A randomized controlled trial of a virtual lifestyle modification intervention followed by a mindful self-compassion intervention
T2  - OBESITY SCIENCE & PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Internalized weight stigma (Internalized-WS) is prevalent among individuals with severe obesity, particularly women, and is associated with shame, disordered eating, and weight gain. Effective, accessible interventions that address both severe (Class-Ill) obesity and Internalized-WS are needed. This randomized pilot trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully-remote lifestyle modification intervention (LM) followed by mindful self-compassion training (MSC) or control.Methods: Twenty-eight women with Class-III obesity (46.6 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) and elevated Internalized-WS were randomized to a virtually-delivered 4-month LM followed by a 2-month MSC or cooking/dietary education (CON). Psychosocial measures/weight were assessed at baseline, 4-(post-LM), 6-(post-MSC/CON), and 9-month (follow-up).Results: Improvements in Internalized-WS, shame, and self-compassion were observed with LM. Mean 4-month weight loss was 6.3 +/- 3.7%. MSC had lower attendance and usefulness ratings versus CON. Post-MSC/CON, MSC yielded significant and/or meaningful improvements in Internalized-WS, self-compassion, and intuitive eating relative to CON. Weight loss did not differ by group at 6-month, and at 9-month trended lower in MSC versus CON.Conclusion: Virtual LM is feasible, acceptable, and leads to significant weight loss among women with severe obesity; MSC led to further improved Internalized-WS, self-compassion, and intuitive eating. Continued work is needed to elucidate effects of self-compassion training on Internalized-WS, its mechanisms, and linkages to cardiometabolic health and long-term weight loss.

TI  - A Randomized Control Trial of a Brief Self-Compassion Intervention for Perfectionism, Anxiety, Depression, and Body Image
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Due to a rise in perfectionistic tendencies and growing concerns about the increase in mental health conditions among students this study aimed to examine the effects of a brief intervention in self-compassion on maladaptive perfectionism, anxiety, depression, and body image.Methods: The intervention consisted of four seminars and a silent half-day retreat with short lectures and relevant experiential practices from Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). This randomized wait-list control trial was pre-registered at (ID: NCT03453437, Unique Protocol ID: UiBMSC2018). University students were randomly assigned to the intervention group and wait-list control group and filled out surveys weekly. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the groups pre- and post-treatment. Mixed level modeling was used to analyze changes in all outcome measures over time.Results: Eighty-nine participants completed the intervention. Results of the ANOVA showed significant post-intervention reductions in maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies and symptoms of depression and anxiety, in addition to increased self-compassion and improved body image in the intervention group as compared to the wait-list group. Mixed level modeling showed statistically significant changes in self-compassion, maladaptive perfectionism, adaptive perfectionism, anxiety, and depression but not body image. Only the mixed level modeling showed small but significant changes to adaptive perfectionism, also called strivings. Implications of different changes to maladaptive perfectionism than adaptive perfectionism are discussed.

TI  - The Mechanisms of Mindfulness in the Treatment of Mental Illness and Addiction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent with its growing popularity amongst the general public and medical community, throughout recent decades there have been increasing attempts to understand the mechanisms that underlie therapeutic improvement in individuals receiving mindfulness training. The current paper draws upon findings from various remits of scientific enquiry and summarises key evidence-based mechanisms of mindfulness that have been proposed in the academic literature to date. Empirical findings indicate that mindfulness targets biological, psychological, social, and spiritual psychopathology determinants. Furthermore, the mechanistic pathways exploited by mindfulness are likely to vary according to factors such as (i) the type of mindfulness-based intervention that is administered (e.g., first- or second-generation mindfulness-based interventions), (ii) the specific clinical disorder that is being targeted, (iii) the educational, social, and spiritual history of the participant, and (iv) the extent to which the mindfulness instructor truly embodies the principles of mindful living. It is hoped that the mechanisms of mindfulness discussed in this paper will contribute to the formulation of a more complete picture that can be tested and expanded upon during future scientific enquiry.

AB  - Objectives People bereaved by suicide represent a vulnerable population, but postvention still lacks evidence-based resources to support them. Mindfulness and self-compassion-based interventions have proven effective in countering depression, PTSD symptoms, and traumatic bereavement, and may also be beneficial in suicide postvention. To assess the effectiveness of Panta Rhei, a short, intensive, mindful self-compassion-based intervention for people bereaved by suicide, we evaluated baseline and follow-up levels of psychological distress, mindfulness, and self-compassion in participants and a control group.Methods The intervention was a non-randomized trial conducted with 147 people bereaved by suicide of whom 97 participated in a short 16-h intensive experiential intervention. Each of them completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and Profiles of Mood States (POMS) 4-6 days prior to and after the intervention.Results Psychological distress significantly decreased in all areas evaluated by POMS. Participants also showed a significant increase in the FFMQ subscales Observe, Describe, Non-judge, and Non-react, in the SCS Self-Kindness subscale, and in overall Self-Compassion as inferred from significant group*time interaction effects. Sociodemographic, grief-related variables, SCS, and FFMQ at baseline did not correlate with changes in participants' psychological distress.Conclusions Despite being limited by the lack of randomization for ethical reasons and the high prevalence of highly educated females in the control and intervention groups, this study illustrates the effectiveness of a short, intensive, mindful self-compassion-based intervention for a self-selected group of people bereaved by suicide.

TI  - Testing the mindfulness-to-meaning theory: Evidence for mindful positive emotion regulation from a reanalysis of longitudinal data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectiveThe Mindfulness to Meaning Theory (MMT) provides a detailed process model of mindful positive emotion regulation.DesignWe conducted a post-hoc reanalysis of longitudinal data (N = 107) derived from a RCT of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder to model the core constructs of the MMT (attentional control, decentering, broadened awareness, reappraisal, and positive affect) in a multivariate path analysis.ResultsFindings indicated that increases in attentional control from baseline to post-training predicted increases in decentering by 3 months post-treatment (p<.01) that in turn predicted increases in broadened awareness of interoceptive and exteroceptive data by 6 months post-treatment (p<.001). In turn, broadened awareness predicted increases in the use of reappraisal by 9 months post-treatment (p<.01), which culminated in greater positive affect at 12 months post-treatment (p<.001). MBSR led to significantly greater increases in decentering (p<.05) and broadened awareness than CBT (p<.05). Significant indirect effects indicated that increases in decentering mediated the effect of mindfulness training on broadening awareness, which in turn mediated enhanced reappraisal efficacy.ConclusionResults suggest that the mechanisms of change identified by the MMT form an iterative chain that promotes long-term increases in positive affectivity. Though these mechanisms may reflect common therapeutic factors that cut across mindfulness-based and cognitive-ehavioral interventions, MBSR specifically boosts the MMT cycle by producing significantly greater increases in decentering and broadened awareness than CBT, providing support for the foundational assumption in the MMT that mindfulness training may be a key means of stimulating downstream positive psychological processes.

TI  - Long-term effects of a tailored mindfulness-based program for Chinese intensive care unit nurses: A randomized parallel-group trial
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: This study investigated the direct and long-term improvements that mindfulness-based interventions exert on intensive care unit nurses. We assessed an abbreviated four-week, twice-weekly mindfulness-based inter-vention program's effect on work-related mental health variables and examined whether the intervention impact was maintained at two-and six-month follow-up assessments. We also examined the training program's effects on work and life. Background: Previous research has shown that mindfulness interventions exert positive effects immediately after treatment. However, few studies have examined whether treatment effects are maintained over time or under different circumstances. Moreover, treatment effects among Chinese intensive care unit nurses have rarely been examined. Design: We conducted a randomized, non-blinded, parallel-group trial. Methods: Participants included 90 intensive care unit nurses, divided into two cohorts, who participated in the program in October 2016 and April 2017. They completed validated measures of mindfulness, burnout syn-dromes, anxiety and depressive symptoms and well-being at baseline (T1), immediately after intervention (T2), two months after (T3) and six months after (T4) the intervention. Results: We observed a significant group effect (1) immediately post-intervention and two months after inter-vention for mindfulness; (2) at two months after intervention for anxiety, depression and subjective well-being and (3) at post-intervention, two months after and six months after for emotional exhaustion. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the tailored four-week mindfulness-based intervention program improved intensive care unit nurses' mental health, although further research is needed to verify its feasibility in a clinical working environment.

TI  - An Empirical Study of the Mechanisms of Mindfulness in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - S. L. Shapiro and colleagues (2006) have described a testable theory of the mechanisms of mindfulness and how it affects positive change. They describe a model in which mindfulness training leads to a fundamental change in relationship to experience (reperceiving), which leads to changes in self-regulation, values clarification, cognitive and behavioral flexibility, and exposure. These four variables, in turn, result in salutogenic outcomes. Analyses of responses from participants in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction program did not support the mediating effect of changes in reperceiving on the relationship of mindfulness with those four variables. However, when mindfulness and reperceiving scores were combined, partial support was found for the mediating effect of the four variables on measures of psychological distress. Issues arising in attempts to test the proposed theory are discussed, including the description of the model variables and the challenges to their assessment. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Open Hearts Build Lives: Positive Emotions, Induced Through Loving-Kindness Meditation, Build Consequential Personal Resources
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - B. L. Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions asserts that people's daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n = 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.

TI  - Common and distinct lateralised patterns of neural coupling during focused attention, open monitoring and loving kindness meditation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation has been integrated into different therapeutic interventions. To inform the evidence-based selection of specific meditation types it is crucial to understand the neural processes associated with different meditation practices. Here we explore commonalities and differences in electroencephalographic oscillatory spatial synchronisation patterns across three important meditation types. Highly experienced meditators engaged in focused attention, open monitoring, and loving kindness meditation. Improving on previous research, our approach avoids comparisons between groups that limited previous findings, while ensuring that the meditation states are reliably established. Employing a novel measure of neural coupling - the imaginary part of EEG coherence - the study revealed that all meditation conditions displayed a common connectivity pattern that is characterised by increased connectivity of (a) broadly distributed delta networks, (b) left-hemispheric theta networks with a local integrating posterior focus, and (c) right-hemispheric alpha networks, with a local integrating parieto-occipital focus. Furthermore, each meditation state also expressed specific synchronisation patterns differentially recruiting left- or right-lateralised beta networks. These observations provide evidence that in addition to global patterns, frequency-specific inter-hemispheric asymmetry is one major feature of meditation, and that mental processes specific to each meditation type are also supported by lateralised networks from fast-frequency bands.

TI  - Therapeutic mechanisms of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement for internet gaming disorder: Reducing craving and addictive behavior by targeting cognitive processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is characterized by signs and symptoms similar to substance use and gambling disorders, and associated with psychosocial impairments. Research suggests that maladaptive gaming-related cognitions and coping may be implicated in IGD; therefore, interventions for IGD need to target these underlying mechanisms. Mindfulness-based treatment is effective in changing maladaptive cognitive processes and increasing adaptive coping among people with addictions. Aims: This study used data from an RCT of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) for IGD to further examine changes in maladaptive gaming-related cognitions and positive reappraisal as mediators of the effects of MORE on IGD signs/symptoms. Methods: Participants (N = 30, Age M = 25.0, SD = 5.4) were randomized to 8-weekly sessions of MORE or a support group (SG) control condition. IGD severity, levels of craving for video game playing, maladaptive gaming-related cognitions, and positive reappraisal were measured at pre- and posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Multivariate path analyses revealed that effects of MORE in reducing IGD and craving were statistically mediated by changes in maladaptive gaming-related cognitions. Though changes in positive reappraisal did not significantly mediate effects of MORE on IGD or craving, MORE enhanced positive reappraisal to a significantly greater extent than the SG at posttreatment. Discussion: Findings suggest that effects of mindfulness treatment in reducing maladaptive gaming-related cognitions might lead to reductions in IGD severity and cravings for video game playing. This cognitive mechanism should be evaluated in a future, full-scale RCT.

TI  - Effects of online mindful self-compassion intervention on negative body image in breast cancer patients: A randomized controlled trail
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The incidence of breast cancer patients with negative body image has increased. However, research on interventions that explicitly reduce negative body image among breast cancer patients remains inadequate. The development of more pragmatic interventions is imperative. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) intervention to reduce the negative body image in breast cancer patients. Methods: We randomly assigned 64 female breast cancer patients to either the MSC group or the control group. The MSC group received a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion intervention, while the control group received no psychological training. Participants were surveyed by the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF), the Self-Acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and the Body Image Scale (BIS) at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 1-month follow-up (T3). Results: All outcome variables demonstrated significant time main effects and nonsignificant group main effects. The MSC and control groups had significant time x group interaction effects on self-compassion, self-acceptance, perceived stress, and negative body image. Simple main effects analysis revealed significant improvements in outcome variables at three-time points for the MSC group. Conclusion: A 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion intervention can improve self-compassion and selfacceptance and reduce perceived stress and negative body image among the breast cancer patients in MSC group. Mindful Self-Compassion intervention shows promise as a viable way to maintain the mental well-being of breast cancer patients.

TI  - Mindfulness-based SEL programming to increase preservice teachers' mindfulness and emotional competence
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eighty-seven preservice teachers, some of whom had preschool teaching experience, were randomly assigned to an intervention that included training in breathing awareness meditation infused with social-emotional learning (n=43) or a control group that received training in (n=44) in breathing awareness meditation only. Both groups showed an increase in mindfulness from pre- to posttest. However, as expected, dimensions of emotional competence improved more significantly for preservice teachers in the intervention group. Increases were also greater for participants with teaching experience. Both groups also increased in the belief that classroom misbehavior would result in negative cognitive and social costs to children, but a larger increase was observed for the intervention group. Implications for teacher preparation are discussed.

TI  - Caregiver Training in Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Supports (MBPBS): Effects on Caregivers and Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Caregivers often manage the aggressive behavior of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities that reside in community group homes. Sometimes this results in adverse outcomes for both the caregivers and the care recipients. We provided a 7-day intensive Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) training to caregivers from community group homes and assessed the outcomes in terms of caregiver variables, individuals' behaviors, and an administrative outcome. When compared to pre-MBPBS training, the MBPBS training resulted in the caregivers using significantly less physical restraints, and staff stress and staff turnover were considerably reduced. The frequency of injury to caregivers and peers caused by the individuals was significantly reduced. A benefit-cost analysis showed substantial financial savings due to staff participation in the MBPBS program. This study provides further proof-of-concept for the effectiveness of MBPBS training for caregivers, and strengthens the call for training staff in mindfulness meditation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness and self-compassion are reported to have a preventive effects on depression and anxiety disorders. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of mindful self-compassion intervention on preventing postpartum depression in a group of symptomatic pregnant women. Participants were screened and assigned to the intervention and control groups randomly. A 6-week Internet-based Mindful Self-Compassion Program was used to train the participants. Multiple scales were used to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, mindfulness, self-compassion, and mother and infant well-being. All assessments were performed at three time points: baseline, 3 months, and 1 year postpartum. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in depressive and anxiety behaviors. In addition, the intervention group became more mindful and self-compassionate at 3 months and 1 year postpartum. More importantly, both mothers and infants experienced substantial improvement in well-being. Our findings indicate that mindful self-compassion intervention is effective in preventing postpartum depression and promoting mother and infant well-being.

TI  - The Impact of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Job-Related Burnout of Nurses Working in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
T2  - HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Job-related burnout is one health outcome in nurses working in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) due to the heavy workload, which results in negative physical and psychological consequences. One newly introduced approach to improve coping is loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Some studies have shown the effectiveness of the LKM on the mental health of nurses, though more evidence is required to support them. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the LKM on job-related burnout of nurses working in NICU. This clustered controlled randomized clinical trial assessed job-related burnout before and after a month of practicing LKM guided through a virtual method. A total of 66 eligible NICU nurses from 2 referral children hospitals in Tehran were randomly assigned to 2 control (n = 33) and intervention (n = 33) groups. The intervention was performed 3 times a week for 1 month in the form of 20-minute audio files of LKM for the intervention group, and educational files on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic were sent to the control group. The instruments used in this study were the demographic information questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which participants completed before and after the intervention. The mean difference in the overall scores of burnout before and after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly reduced (P = .003), but no significant difference was observed in the control group (P = .018). These findings support the benefit of LKM in NICU nurses in reducing burnout.

TI  - Eat Breathe Thrive: an interpretative phenomenological analysis of a yoga-based eating disorder intervention
T2  - EATING DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that yoga-based interventions might aid in the prevention and treatment of eating disorders. The current qualitative study used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to analyze the nature and degree of impact of a yoga and mindfulness-based eating disorder prevention intervention Eat Breath Thrive (EBT). Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with 16 participants over the age of 18 who took part in the EBT program between 2018 and 2022. Using IPA methodology, and after several rounds of coding, emergent themes were interpreted and organized to develop a theoretical model explaining the mechanism of change experienced and described by EBT participants. The resulting model outlines an experiential progression from psychoeducation and skill development/practice to increased mindful awareness, and empowered state experiences which led to the following outcomes: independent positive action, self-initiated positive state experiences, and increased embodied well-being. Participants reported increased self-compassion and self-acceptance, with decreased emphasis on disordered eating behaviors. Qualitative data is necessary for understanding why yoga works, from an experiential perspective. This study adds to the new, and rapidly expanding body of research supporting the positive effects of yoga and mindfulness on the prevention and treatment of eating disorders.

TI  - Mindfulness and self-compassion as tools in health behavior change: An evaluation of a workplace intervention pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While interventions teaching general mindfulness and self-compassion have been effective in promoting health and participation in health behaviors, more research is needed to evaluate the effect of targeted interventions that teach participants to apply mindfulness and self-compassion to health behaviors. A sample of 24 university employees participated in a 10-week health behavior change intervention that featured psychoeducation in mindful and self-compassionate nutrition, exercise, and stress management and engagement in guided group exercise. The intervention produced significant improvements in mindfulness, self-compassion, mindful health behaviors, and some health behaviors, well-being measures, and some body composition and physical fitness measures. This program had high satisfaction and low attrition rates. These findings provide initial evidence that targeted mindfulness and self-compassion may be useful components of health behavior change interventions.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion program for chronic pain patients: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundAlthough evidence-based psychological treatments for chronic pain (CP) have been demonstrated to be effective for a variety of outcomes, modest effects observed in recent reviews indicate scope for improvement. Self-compassion promotes a proactive attitude towards self-care and actively seeking relief from suffering. Consequently, more compassionate people experience better physical, psychological and interpersonal well-being.MethodsWe conducted a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial to examine the effects of a Mindful Self-Compassion program (MSC) on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with CP. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention arms: MSC or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). The protocols of both intervention arms were standardized and consisted of a 150-min session once a week during 8 weeks formatted to groups of no more than 20 participants. The primary outcome was self-compassion, measured with the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). The secondary outcomes were other pain-related scores, quality-of-life measures, and anxiety and depression scores.ResultsIn all, 62 and 61 patients were assigned to the MSC and CBT groups, respectively. The MSC intervention was more effective than CBT for self-compassion (average treatment effect [ATE] = 0.126, p < 0.05). The secondary outcomes, pain acceptance (ATE = 5.214, p < 0.01), pain interference (ATE = -0.393, p < 0.05), catastrophizing (ATE = -2.139, p < 0.10) and anxiety (ATE = -0.902, p < 0.05), were also favoured in the experimental arm (MSC). No serious adverse events were observed.ConclusionsMindful Self-Compassion is an appropriate therapeutic approach for CP patients and may result in greater benefits on self-compassion and emotional well-being than CBT.SignificanceThis randomized controlled trial compares the novel intervention (MSC program) with the gold standard psychological intervention for CP (CBT). MSC improves the levels of self-compassion, a therapeutic target that is receiving attention since the last two decades, and it also improves anxiety symptoms, pain interference and pain acceptance more than what CBT does. These results provide empirical support to guide clinical work towards the promotion of self-compassion in psychotherapeutic interventions for people with CP.

TI  - Psychosocial interventions on the posttraumatic growth of adults with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundIt has been increasingly recognized that some people experience post-traumatic growth (PTG) as a result of struggling with cancer.ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to identify psychosocial interventions that might facilitate PTG in adults with cancer.MethodsA search was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ProQuest up to 16 September 2022. The PRISMA guidelines were followed; all included interventional studies had to comprise 30 or more adults with cancer, using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, from 1994 forward.ResultsA total of 2731 articles were retrieved, 1028 of those were screened and 37 unique trials were included (46 articles). A large number of studies were published since 2018 (52.4%), were randomized controlled trials (43.2%), and had group interventions (34.8%), including mainly female participants (83.8%) with a single cancer type (54.1%). Most interventions (75.7%) were moderately to highly effective in increasing PTG (d = 0.65, 95% CI 0.39-0.91) with the most effective interventions using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (d = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.05-2.44), Mindfulness-based (d = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.14-0.94) and Education, Peer Support and Health Coaching interventions (d = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.1-0.46). Expression-based and Positive Psychology-based approaches also showed promising results. Notably, the majority of studies had a high risk of bias.ConclusionsPTG facilitation is a promising field that should be pursued as it not only allows people with cancer to overcome their trauma but also results in them going over and above their pre-cancer state, enhancing resilience, health, and well-being.

TI  - A Pilot Study of the 8-Week Mindful Self-Compassion Training Program in a Chinese Community Sample
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this uncontrolled pilot study was to explore the potential of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program for reducing psychological distress and increasing compassion in a Chinese community sample. Self-report data on measures of compassion and psychological distress were collected at pre-test (N = 49), post-test (N = 44), and 3-month follow-up (N = 35) among a convenience sample of Chinese women (mean age = 36.6 years). Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and maladaptive perfectionism was investigated as a potential moderator of the effects of time on outcomes. Significant main effects of time were observed for mean scores on self-compassion, compassion for others, fears of self-compassion, rumination, depression, anxiety, and stress, and these changes were maintained at follow-up. These relationships were not moderated by perfectionism. Effect size calculations indicated large effect sizes for all outcomes, indicating that the MSC program holds promise for increasing compassion and reducing psychological distress among Chinese females. Further research is required to demonstrate the efficacy of this program relative to control conditions, using more representative samples.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of the new short-term online emotion focused training for self-compassion and self-protection in a nonclinical sample
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Emotion Focused Training for Self-Compassion and Self-Protection (EFT-SCP) is an intervention developed to increase skills of self-compassion and protective anger with the aim to decrease self-criticism. This novel intervention was developed on the basis of the latest findings on self-criticism from Emotion-focused therapy and previous programs cultivating compassion (namely Compassion Mind Training and Mindful Self-Compassion Program). According to existing research, simply cultivating self-compassion is not always sufficient in reducing self-criticism. Therefore, the EFT-SCP was designed to build self-compassion whilst developing protective anger to combat self-criticism. Our goal was to investigate the efficacy of this new, short-term, online EFT-SCP program in a non-clinical population. A randomized control trial was conducted with pre- and post-intervention measurements and two-month follow-up of self-compassion and self-criticism/reassurance. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants through a snowballing technique on social media. A total of 123 participants were randomly allocated to the EFT-SCP intervention or to a control condition. The intervention group were instructed through emails to complete an EFT-SCP task every day for 14 consecutive days. The control group did not complete any tasks. Out of 123 participants, 31 from intervention group and 20 from control group completed all measurements. There was a significant effect of the EFT-SCP on increasing self-compassion and self-reassurance scores as reported at two-month follow-up. The EFT-SCP was also effective at reducing self-uncompassionate responding and self-criticism (specifically Hated self) with changes evident at two months post-intervention. These findings are encouraging and suggest that interventions designed to enhance self-compassion and decrease self-criticism can be delivered to broader populations without the direct contact with mental health professionals.

TI  - Feasibility, acceptability, and depression outcomes of a randomized controlled trial of Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens (MSC-T) for adolescents with subsyndromal depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAdolescents are experiencing high rates of depressive symptoms, with negative consequences to their long-term health. Group-based, mindful self-compassion programs show promise in mitigating the development of more significant depression in at-risk adolescents. However, the lack of well-designed, active control conditions has limited the ability to examine the efficacy of such interventions.MethodsFifty-nine adolescents (Mage = 15.81, 70% female) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms from the Southeastern US were randomized to group-based Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens (N = 30) or a newly developed active control Healthy Lifestyles group (N = 29) during 2018 and 2019. Participants attended 8 weekly "main" sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. The feasibility and acceptability of participation in both groups were measured using attrition, attendance, credibility, and satisfaction data. Depression scores were collected weekly, and self-compassion scores were collected five times across 36 weeks.ResultsBoth groups were equally feasible and acceptable during the 8-week program period; however, monthly continuation sessions were poorly attended in both groups. The risk of developing clinically significant depression was 2.6 times higher in the control group compared with the self-compassion group (p = .037) across 36 weeks. Depression significantly decreased in the self-compassion group, while it significantly increased in the control group. Both groups increased significantly in reports of self-compassion. These findings are on par with results noting the efficacy of cognitive-based interventions for high-risk adolescents; follow-up studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to confirm these findings.ConclusionsInitial examination suggests Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens programming is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in preventing the development of clinically significant depression in adolescents with subsyndromal depression. Future studies may benefit from refinements to the self-compassion measurement and/or the attention control condition; moreover, larger sample sizes are needed to confirm results.

TI  - Psychophysiological stress response after a 6-week Mindful Self-Compassion training in psychiatric rehabilitation inpatients: a randomized post-test only study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesMindfulness-based interventions (including self-compassion interventions) are effective in improving stress management at psychological and physical levels. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) is a newly developed program particularly aimed at increasing self-compassion. The main objective of this study was to determine whether the psychophysiological stress response during a social-evaluative speaking task differs in inpatients participating in the MSC or the Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) program at the end of their 6-week psychiatric rehabilitation stay (i.e., post-test only design). MethodData from 50 inpatients (25 MSC, 25 PMR, 35 female) aged 19 to 76 years (M = 47.22, SD = 12.44) were analyzed in terms of psychophysiological stress response. For this purpose, heart rate variability, heart rate, and blood pressure were assessed together with several psychometric variables: positive and negative affect (PANAS), subjective stress perception (Visual Analog Scale), self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale), cognitive reappraisal and suppression (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory-18), and appraisal and rumination (selected items). ResultsAfter correction for alpha inflation no differences in the psychophysiological stress response and psychometric parameters between the MSC and PMR group were found. DiscussionIn general, our results indicate that MSC is not superior to PMR training. However, more research with clinical randomized controlled trials investigating larger samples are needed to further affirm these initial findings.

TI  - Mechanisms of mindfulness: Rumination and self-compassion
T2  - NORDIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Why do more mindful individuals tend to be less depressed? We hypothesized (1) that mindfulness is associated with depressive symptoms both via the path of lower levels of rumination and higher levels of self-compassion and (2) that the path via self-compassion would explain variance beyond that which could be explained by rumination. Undergraduate students (N=277) completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Rumination subscale of the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire, the Self-Compassion Scale, and the depression subscale of the symptom checklist-90 revised (SCL-90-R-dep). Results showed that mindfulness was associated with depressive symptoms both via the pathway of lower levels of rumination and via the pathway of higher levels of self-compassion. Both pathways were found to predict unique variance in depressive symptoms beyond that which could be explained by the other pathway. This suggests that one needs to consider the influence of mindfulness on both rumination and on self-compassion in order to fully understand why mindful individuals tend to be less depressed.

TI  - Efficacy and Moderation of Mobile App-Based Programs for Mindfulness-Based Training, Self-Compassion Training, and Cognitive Behavioral Psychoeducation on Mental Health: Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Trial
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based interventions, self-compassion training, and cognitive behavioral therapy have garnered much evidence in its salutary effects on mental health. With increasing application of smartphone and mobile technology on health promotion, this study investigated the efficacy and possible moderators of mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation training mobile apps in the improvement of mental health.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of 3 mobile app-based programs . mindfulness-based program, self-compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation program in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. Changes in mindful awareness and self-compassion were also assessed. To further delineate the suitability of each program for different types of individuals, individual difference variables (ie, discomfort with emotions and tolerance for ambiguity) were explored for potential moderation.Methods: This study was a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial examining the efficacy of mindfulness-based program, self-compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation. Participants were randomized into either 1 of the 3 conditions. Throughout the 4-week, 28-session program, participants spent 10-15 min daily reviewing the course content and practicing various related exercises. At preprogram, postprogram, and 3-month follow-up, participants also completed Web-based measures of mental well-being, psychological distress, mindful-awareness, and self-compassion as well as the proposed moderators.Results: Among the 2161 study participants, 508 and 349 completed the post- and 3-month follow-up assessment, respectively. All 3 conditions (mindfulness basedprogram: N=703; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation: N=753; self-compassion program: N=705) were found to be efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. All conditions enhanced mindful awareness at postprogram. Significant interaction effect was found on self-compassion; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation and self-compassion program, but not mindfulness-based program, significantly enhanced self-compassion at postprogram. No significant differences regarding usage and users' satisfaction were found among the 3 conditions. None of the proposed moderators were found to be significant.Conclusions: Mindfulness-based, self-compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation mobile apps were efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress among adults at postprogram and 3-month follow-up. Future app-based psychological training programs should consider gamification and personalization of content or feedback to enhance engagement and mitigate the high attrition rates that are common in app-based health promotion programs.

TI  - Effectiveness of Caregiver Training in Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) vs. Training-as-Usual (TAU): A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) often end up having their medical and psychological well-being compromised due to the stressful nature of caregiving, especially when those in their care engage in aggressive behavior. In this study, we provided caregivers with mindfulness-based training to enable them to better manage their psychological well-being and, through this, to also enhance specific indices of quality of life of the individuals in their care. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the comparative effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and Training-as-Usual (TAU) for caregivers in a congregate care facility for individuals with severe and profound IDD. The comparative effects of the two training conditions were assessed in terms of caregiver variables care recipient variable (number of aggressive events), and agency variables Results showed that MBPBS was significantly more effective than TAU in enabling the caregivers to manage their perceived psychological stress, and to reduce the use of physical restraints and stat medications for aggressive behavior of the individuals in their care. In addition, there were significant reductions in aggressive events by the individuals in their care, 1:1 staffing of individuals with aggressive behavior, and staff turnover. Furthermore, the MBPBS training was significantly more cost-effective than the TAU training. If replicated in future RCT studies, MBPBS may provide an effective means of enhancing socially acceptable bidirectional engagement of caregivers and care recipients within a person-centered context.

TI  - Young adult cancer survivors' experiences with a mindful self-compassion (MSC) video-chat intervention: A qualitative analysis
T2  - SELF AND IDENTITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Young adult cancer survivors (YACS) are a vulnerable population that reports high anxiety, social isolation, and feelings of inadequacy after cancer treatment completion. Mindful self-compassion (MSC) provides strategies for coping with suffering. We explored how MSC practices addressed the psychosocial needs of a nationally recruited YACS sample (N=20, all female, age M=27.00, various cancer types) that participated in an 8-week MSC video-chat intervention. Descriptive qualitative analysis of the intervention recordings revealed three YACS' psychosocial needs: peer isolation, body concerns, and health-related anxiety. MSC practices addressed these in a number of ways including: self-reliance for emotional support, common humanity within the YACS community, gratitude, self-kindness, and acceptance. Meanwhile, the body scan practice initially triggered distress for some; implications are discussed.

TI  - Self-compassion among psychotherapy clients is in the details of negative, not positive, emotions
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-compassion involves the capacity to accept one's negative emotional experiences with kindness and mindful awareness, acknowledging them as part of the human condition. The present work is premised on the idea that self-compassion may be tied to the degree to which individuals are able to distinguish among their negative emotional states. We hypothesized that psychotherapy clients high in self-compassion will be better at distinguishing among their negative (but not positive) emotional states. Clients (N = 136) from a community clinic completed the Self Compassion Scale pre-and post-treatment. Clients' self-compassion levels as well as their emotional states were monitored before and after each psychotherapy session, respectively. Negative emotion differentiation was associated with both treatment and session level self-compassion; in contrast, positive emotion differentiation was not correlated with self-compassion levels. The implications of the findings will be discussed in light of contemporary accounts of self-compassion, affect dynamics, and affect regulation.

TI  - Implementation Science of Mindfulness in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
T2  - AJIDD-AMERICAN JOURNAL ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation science deals with the translation of evidence-based knowledge into practice in the real world. Mindfulness-based programs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) emerged about 20 years ago. Efficacy and effectiveness studies provide the evidence-base for these programs and the field of IDD is moving towards large scale implementation of these programs. This article presents a model for implementing mindfulness-based programs in community settings, including family and group homes, schools, vocational settings, and congregate care facilities. The model is based on the 3-tier positive behavior support (PBS) system commonly used in school, family, and agency settings. Specific mindfulness-based programs can be linked to each of the three tiers to improve the quality of life of people with IDD.

TI  - Study protocol of guided mobile-based perinatal mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI) - a randomized controlled trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPsychological distress is a common occurrence among women during the perinatal period. Maternal psychological distress (MPS) can also have a negative influence on neonatal outcomes such as infant health, child development or mother-child interaction. Hence, interventions to improve mental wellbeing during this period are vital. Mindfulness based intervention (MBI) has been found to be effective in reducing psychological distress. Delivery of MBI via the internet, making it accessible and inexpensive, is showing a promising positive effect in reducing psychological distress. A randomized control trial with sufficient power is required to confirm its positive effect among pregnant women. The positive effects of MBI have been found to be associated with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback; however, the efficacy of MBI on HRV has been rarely studied among pregnant women. Also, the potential association of HRV with MBI and psychological wellbeing needs further examination. This research aims to test the effectiveness of guided mobile-based perinatal mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI) among pregnant women experiencing psychological distress during the pre- and post-natal period, as well as examining the efficacy of GMBPMI on HRV.MethodThis study is a randomized controlled trial that follows a parallel design. Consenting pregnant women in their second trimester (between 12th and 20th week gestation) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (GMBPMI) or a control group (psychoeducation). The intended sample size is 198, with 99 participants in each group. Three levels of outcomes will be measured at baseline, post intervention in both the intervention and control groups, and at 36-week gestation and five-week postpartum. The primary outcomes include maternal psychological stress, mindfulness and positive appraisal HRV. Secondary outcomes are psychological and physical wellbeing. Tertiary outcomes include obstetric and neonatal outcomes, and social support. Analyses will follow an intention-to-treat method and repeated measures MANOVA will be conducted to compare changes in primary and secondary outcomes. A series of mixed-effects models will be fitted to assess the mediation effects.DiscussionThis trial expects to increase understanding of GMBPMI on HRV and psychological wellbeing for pregnant women, with extended support in both pre-and post-natal periods. The study could also potentially provide evidence for delivery of cost-effective and accessible services to pregnant women.

TI  - Commitment to a Purpose in Life: An Antidote to the Suffering by Individuals With Social Anxiety Disorder
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent acceptance-and mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral interventions explicitly target the clarification and commitment to a purpose in life. Yet, scant empirical evidence exists on the value of purpose as a mechanism relevant to psychopathology or well-being. The present research explored daily (within-person) fluctuations in purposeful pursuits and well-being in a community sample of 84 adults with (n = 41) and without (n = 43) the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder (SAD). After completing an idiographic measure of purpose in life, participants monitored their effort and progress toward this purpose, along with their well-being each day. Across 2 weeks of daily reports, we found that healthy controls reported increased self-esteem, meaning in life, positive emotions, and decreased negative emotions. People with SAD experienced substantial boosts in well-being indicators on days characterized by significant effort or progress toward their life purpose. We found no evidence for the reverse direction (with well-being boosting the amount of effort or progress that people with SAD devote to their purpose), and effects could not be attributed to comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. Results provide evidence for how commitment to a purpose in life enriches the daily existence of people with SAD. The current study supports principles that underlie what many clinicians are already doing with clients for SAD.

TI  - Experiences of a Mindfulness-Based Stress-Reduction Intervention Among Patients With Cancer
T2  - CANCER NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is increasing recognition of mindfulness and mindfulness training as a way to decrease stress and increase psychological functioning. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects and experiences of mindfulness stress-reduction training as described by patients with cancer participating in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction training program. Interventions/Methods: The study is based on analysis of data collected in semistructured interviews of the participants (n = 18) after the completion of a mindfulness-meditation training program. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course. Results: Most participants expressed a number of perceived positive effects of participating in the mindfulness program including increased calm, enhanced sleep quality, more energy, less physical pain, and increased well-being. However, a few participants experienced no effect. Both negative and positive views of the specific meditation and yoga exercises included in the program were expressed. Components that were described as of particular importance, regarding the experience of participating in the program, were the nonjudgmental and accepting approach guiding the program and the instructors, the influence of the group process and sharing experiences with patients with similar experiences, and the emphasis on increased awareness of the present moment. Conclusion: This study gives support for the use of mindfulness programs in reducing stress-related complaints among some patients with a cancer diagnosis. Implications for Practice: The positive experiences of mindfulness training reported by patients with cancer call for further studies examining the possibilities and requirements for implementation of mindfulness programs in clinical practice.

TI  - Reducing Suicide Ideation in Transgender Adolescents with Mindful Self-Compassion: An Open Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectivesThis open trial aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a modified version of Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens for transgender adolescents and assess changes in suicide ideation and other measures of emotional well-being. As an exploratory measure, we investigated potential moderators of suicide ideation outcomes, such as self-compassion.MethodTwo cohorts of transgender and gender-diverse adolescents recruited from the US and Canada (n = 35; age range 13-17, M = 14.9, SD = 1.19) participated in an eight-session online self-compassion program. Quantitative measures of wellbeing (i.e., suicide ideation, depression, resilience) were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up, and qualitative data (through open-ended questions on an electronic form) were collected at post-intervention and 2-month follow-up.ResultsSuicide ideation decreased with large effect sizes from baseline to follow-up, and most other measures of wellbeing improved with small to moderate effect sizes. Feasibility was confirmed, and acceptability differed markedly between cohorts, with the cohort with greater acceptability improving in mental health attributes to a greater degree. Self-compassion and thwarted belongingness, a factor related to suicide ideation, moderated suicide ideation such that those with greater self-compassion or less thwarted belongingness experienced less suicide ideation.ConclusionsSelf-compassion programs can be beneficial to help transgender adolescents manage the stressors and negative emotional outcomes arising from the anti-trans sociopolitical discourse that has been pervasive in the US. We provide recommendations for future implementations, including that someone who is transgender be part of the instructional staff. Future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes and randomized control trials to confirm the present findings.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

TI  - The effect of loving-kindness meditation on employees' mindfulness, affect, altruism and knowledge hiding
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study investigated the effects of the loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on employees' mindfulness, affect, altruism and knowledge hiding. Methods In total, 100 employees were recruited from a knowledge-based enterprise in China and randomly divided into the LKM training group (n = 50) and the control group (n = 50). The LKM training group underwent LKM training for 8 weeks, while the control group did not. Seven main variables (mindfulness, altruism positive affect, negative affect, playing dumb, rationalized hiding, and evasive hiding) were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. Results The LKM intervention significantly increased participants' altruism, and significantly reduced negative affect, playing dumb and evasive hiding, but did not significantly improve mindfulness, positive affect, and rationalized hiding. Conclusions LKM significantly improved employees' altruism, and significantly reduce their negative affect, but did not significantly improve their mindfulness and positive affect. For knowledge hiding, LKM significantly reduced playing dumb and evasive hiding, but had no significant effect on rationalized hiding. These results further elucidate the psychological effects of LKM and suggest the possibility of reducing knowledge hiding in the workplace.

TI  - The compassionate journey: An exploratory and controlled study assessing self-compassion-focussed mindfulness in a nonclinical sample
T2  - COUNSELLING & PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to test a self-compassion-focussed mindfulness (SCFM) intervention for increasing self-compassion and decreasing depressive symptoms, as well as to test the effect of initial self-compassion as a possible moderator. Community volunteers participated in an SCFM group or in a control group and self-reported at three points in time: at baseline (study, n = 73; control, n = 80), at the end of the 5-week five-session intervention (study, n = 57; control, n = 61) and at follow-up 5 weeks later (study, n = 47; control, n = 50). The SCFM was a Hebrew adaptation based on a mindful self-compassion programme, which is available online. The SCFM was held in person, in small groups (N < 20) over a 2-month period. A four-way interaction was found to be significant [F(2, 186) = 3.70, p = 0.027, & eta;(2)p = 0.038]. Post hoc tests showed that those who were initially low on self-compassion and participated in the SCFM experienced relief in their depressive symptoms and that their level of self-compassion was increased. This implies that self-compassion is a moderating trait, with the benefit of relieving suffering. By increasing the levels of self-compassion in individuals, it is possible to improve their psychological health.

TI  - Caring for the caregivers: Evaluation of the effect of an eight-week pilot mindful self-compassion (MSC) training program on nurses' compassion fatigue and resilience
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNurses vicariously exposed to the suffering of those in their care are at risk of compassion fatigue. Emerging research suggests that self-compassion interventions may provide protective factors and enhance resilience. This pilot study examined the effect of an eight-week Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training intervention on nurses' compassion fatigue and resilience and participants' lived experience of the effect of the training.MethodsThis observational mixed research pilot study adopted an evaluation design framework. It comprised of a single group and evaluated the effects of a pilot MSC intervention by analyzing the pre- and post-change scores in self-compassion, mindfulness, secondary trauma, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and resilience. The sample of the nurses' (N = 13) written responses to the question, "How did you experience the effect of this pilot MSC training?" were also analyzed.ResultsThe Pre- to Post- scores of secondary trauma and burnout declined significantly and were negatively associated with self-compassion (r = -.62, p = .02) (r = -.55, p = .05) and mindfulness (r = -.54, p = .05). (r = -.60, p = .03), respectively. Resilience and compassion satisfaction scores increased. All variables demonstrated a large effect size: Mean (M) Cohen's d = 1.23. The qualitative emergent themes corroborated the quantitative findings and expanded the understanding about how MSC on the job practices enhanced nurses' coping.ConclusionThis is the first study to examine the effect of a pilot (MSC) training program on nurses' compassion fatigue and resilience in this new area of research. It provides some preliminary empirical evidence in support of the theorized benefits of self-compassion training for nurses. However, further research, such as a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with a larger sample size and a longitudinal study, is required to see if the benefits of self-compassion training are sustainable.

TI  - Associations Between Mindfulness and Mental Health Outcomes: a Systematic Review of Ecological Momentary Assessment Research
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives Psychological science has taken up investigations of the effectiveness of mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) and mechanisms through which people benefit from mindfulness. Reliable and valid psychometric tools are essential components of psychological science, and efforts have been made to produce tools for the accurate measurement of mindfulness as a construct. However, trait measurement methods, which are commonly used, may not adequately assess mindfulness and mental health outcomes in a way that allows for mechanisms to be adequately tested. Intensive longitudinal assessment methods sample behavior and experience multiple times over a brief period of several days or weeks and may be more appropriate methods for testing mechanisms of action. We provide a systematic review of published, peer-reviewed studies that used intensive longitudinal methods to investigate the effects of mindfulness on mental health outcomes. Methods Articles were included in the systematic review if mindfulness measures and/or mindfulness interventions were a part of the study design and if intensive longitudinal methods were used to assess mindfulness or mental health outcomes. Results Findings consistently demonstrated a positive association between mindfulness and mental health. Only two studies collected both trait and state measurements of either mindfulness or mental health outcomes, and results indicated that EMA produced larger effect sizes between mindfulness and mental health outcomes. Conclusions Theorized associations between mindfulness and mental health are supported by the current EMA literature. Intensive longitudinal methods may produce more consistent and reliable results through increased sensitivity and ecological validity in that they examine the momentary relationships between mindfulness and mental health outcomes. Thus, intensive longitudinal assessment may be a more appropriate method for investigating hypothesized mechanisms of action in MBPs.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeOver the last 10-15years, there has been a substantive increase in compassion-based interventions aiming to improve psychological functioning and well-being.MethodsThis study provides an overview and synthesis of the currently available compassion-based interventions. What do these programmes looks like, what are their aims, and what is the state of evidence underpinning each of them?ResultsThis overview has found at least eight different compassion-based interventions (e.g., Compassion-Focused Therapy, Mindful Self-Compassion, Cultivating Compassion Training, Cognitively Based Compassion Training), with six having been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, and with a recent meta-analysis finding that compassion-based interventions produce moderate effect sizes for suffering and improved life satisfaction.ConclusionsAlthough further research is warranted, the current state of evidence highlights the potential benefits of compassion-based interventions on a range of outcomes that clinicians can use in clinical practice with clients.

TI  - Problem solving and affect as mechanisms linking daily mindfulness to task performance and job satisfaction
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the daily relationships between mindfulness and job satisfaction via affect and mindfulness and task performance via problem solving confidence. Participants were 57 full-time and part-time employees who completed a baseline survey and five daily diary entries. Data were analysed using multilevel modelling. On days when they experienced greater mindfulness, employees also experienced (a) greater daily job satisfaction via high-activation positive affect (but not low-activation positive affect nor negative affect) and (b) greater daily self-reported task performance via problem solving confidence. Our findings suggest that high-activation positive affect and problem solving confidence may be important daily mechanisms of mindfulness at work. Growing evidence links mindfulness to work-related outcomes; however, limited research has investigated the mechanisms involved. The present study is one of the first to collect empirical observations regarding how state mindfulness operates at work on a daily basis, providing support for both affective and cognitive pathways. Advances in this area can underpin a robust theoretical framework to guide the implementation of daily mindfulness practice and interventions targeting specific work-related outcomes.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Residents: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Burnout is highly prevalent in residents. No randomized controlled trials have been conducted measuring the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on burnout in residents.To determine the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing burnout in residents.A randomized controlled trial comparing MBSR with a waitlist control group.Residents from all medical, surgical and primary care disciplines were eligible to participate. Participants were self-referred.The MBSR consisted of eight weekly 2.5-h sessions and one 6-h silent day.The primary outcome was the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Dutch version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey. Secondary outcomes included the depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment subscales of burnout, worry, work-home interference, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, positive mental health, empathy and medical errors. Assessment took place at baseline and post-intervention approximately 3 months later.Of the 148 residents participating, 138 (93%) completed the post-intervention assessment. No significant difference in emotional exhaustion was found between the two groups. However, the MBSR group reported significantly greater improvements than the control group in personal accomplishment (p = 0.028, d = 0.24), worry (p = 0.036, d = 0.23), mindfulness skills (p = 0.010, d = 0.33), self-compassion (p = 0.010, d = 0.35) and perspective-taking (empathy) (p = 0.025, d = 0.33). No effects were found for the other measures. Exploratory moderation analysis showed that the intervention outcome was moderated by baseline severity of emotional exhaustion; those with greater emotional exhaustion did seem to benefit.The results of our primary outcome analysis did not support the effectiveness of MBSR for reducing emotional exhaustion in residents. However, residents with high baseline levels of emotional exhaustion did appear to benefit from MBSR. Furthermore, they demonstrated modest improvements in personal accomplishment, worry, mindfulness skills, self-compassion and perspective-taking. More research is needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation training in an occupational setting: Effects of a 12-weeks mindfulness-based intervention on wellbeing
T2  - WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are known for their beneficial effects on positive and negative psychological factors. When applied in an occupational context, MBIs might help workers to cope with stress, increase their professional outcomes and wellbeing.OBJECTIVE: In this two-groups pre-post experimental design we tested the effect of our MBI, called Integral Meditation (IM), among the employers of an Italian service company by measuring positive and negative aspects of psychological wellbeing related to mindfulness and workplace functioning through eight self-report questionnaires (CORE-OM, FFMQ, WEMWBS, MAIA, PSS, PANAS, STAI-X1, SCS).METHOD: Forty-two voluntary non-clinical employers of the company, randomly assigned to the experimental or the control group, were analyzed. The experimental group underwent our IM program, which consists of 12 weekly meditation classes given after the afternoon shift, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data was analyzed via linear mixed models.RESULTS: Statistically significant results were obtained for FFMQ observing subscale (beta = 0.49, p = 0.014), WEMWBS (beta = 5.31, p = 0.02), PSS (beta = -3.31, p = 0.03), the whole scale of SCS (beta = 0.47, p = 0.01) and self-judgment (beta = 0.68, p = 0.003) and isolation (beta = -0.66, p = 0.01) SCS subscales. Statistically significant results were also found in four out of eight subscales of MAIA: emotional awareness (beta = 1.26, p < 0.001), self-regulation (beta = 1.28, p < 0.001), body listening (beta = 1.08, p < 0.001) and trusting (beta = 1.1, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Our intervention has demonstrated to bring beneficial effects in a mindfulness subdomain, in perceived stress, self-compassion, interoception and psychological wellbeing. Based on our results, we conclude that our intervention was effective in increasing the positive aspects of wellbeing and in reducing stress.

TI  - A latent profile analysis of the five facets of mindfulness in a US adult sample: Spiritual and psychological differences among four profiles
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Person-centered studies have grown in the mindfulness literature recently. Previous research has suggested four profiles of mindfulness, each with differential mental health and emotional outcomes. The present study supports the existence of these four profiles of mindfulness based on the five facets of mindfulness (observing, nonjudging, acting with awareness, nonreactivity, and describing). We provide further insight into differences in levels of psychopathology, positive psychology indicators, and spirituality among these profiles. Using model-selection criteria (e.g., BIC, AIC, entropy) in a latent profile analysis (LPA), we identified four clusters of individuals based on their scores on the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) among 1499 US participants. We then compared profiles across measures of positive psychology, psychopathology, and spirituality. Overall, we found support for the four profiles of mindfulness in the U.S. sample, replicating and extending findings from prior studies. In addition, the four profiles showed differential levels of previous experience with mindfulness, mind-body and meditative practice, and in positive psychology and spirituality measures. Specifically, the high-mindfulness profile appeared as the healthiest and most adjusted of the four profiles; the judgmental observing and nonjudgmental aware profile showed higher levels of anxiety, depression, and the lowest levels of well-being. By contrast, the average mindfulness displayed intermediate levels of adjustment, spirituality, and well-being. Spiritual and positive psychology outcomes among the nonjudgmentally aware and judgmental observing appeared mixed. In sum, mindfulness profiles are differentially associated with psychopathology, positive psychology, and spirituality.

TI  - Evaluation of the Breathworks Mindfulness-Based Pain Management Programme: Effects on Well-Being and Multiple Measures of Mindfulness
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two studies of a mindfulness training programme are presented. Study 1 reports on a pilot investigation of the impact on well-being of the Breathworks mindfulness-based pain management programme. Significant positive change was found on self-report measures of depression, outlook, catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy in the Intervention Group, but not the Comparison Group. Particularly large effects were found for pain acceptance. These results support the short-term efficacy of the Breathworks programme and reinforce the importance of acceptance for positive outcome with chronic pain patients. Study 2 investigated alterations in mindfulness following participation in the Breathworks programme. Subjective and non-subjective measures of mindfulness were used. Scores on the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were significantly higher at Time 2 in the Intervention Group, but not in the Comparison Group. There was no change on a measure of sustained attention. Results from an Implicit Association Test provided some support for an increased awareness of positive stimuli, following the intervention. These results are discussed with reference to the mechanisms of mindfulness. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) vs. the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) Programs in Clinical and Health Psychologist Trainees
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study compares the effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) programs in improving mindfulness and self-compassion skills among clinical and health psychology trainees, and analyzes their effects on anxiety and depression. Methods A total of 88 participants were allocated to three conditions: MBSR training (n = 26), MSC training (n = 34), and control group (n = 28). Their levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, anxiety, and depression were measured at pre- and post-intervention. Results Compared to the control group, participants in the MBSR training showed significant improvements in mindfulness and reductions in anxiety and depression from pre to post. Participants in the MSC training, compared to the control group, reported significant increases in mindfulness and self-compassion. We observed that anxiety levels remained stable in the MSC group, while participants in the control group reported an increase in their scores over time. The reduction in depression scores observed among MSC participants did not differ, however, from that observed among members of the control group. Mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxiety scores presented similar trajectories in MBSR and MSC groups, while the MBSR group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in depression levels compared to the MSC group. Conclusions Incorporating these programs into the psychologists' training should be considered, as desirable skills such as mindfulness and self-compassion are enhanced. MBSR and MSC could contribute to prevent mental health problems in this population.

TI  - Applying the Mindful Parenting Program Among Chinese Parents of Children with ADHD: A Randomized Control Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The present study is aimed at investigating the effects and mechanisms of the Mindful Parenting Program (MPP) on the stress of Chinese parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Methods A total of 113 Chinese parents of children with ADHD were randomly assigned to the MPP group (n = 58) or the treatment as usual (TAU) waitlist-control group (n = 55). The following parameters were assessed at baseline and posttreatment: parental stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, as well as general mindfulness, mindful parenting, and self-compassion. Each child's ADHD symptoms and behavioral/emotional symptoms were also measured.Results The MPP group showed significantly greater amelioration of parental stress (F = 8.79, p = .004, effect size d =0.44) compared with that of the TAU waitlist-control group after eight weeks. The MPP group also showed greater improvements in parental general mindfulness (F = 11.40,p < .001, effect size d = 0.56) and self-compassion (F = 17.83,p < .001, effect size d = 0.62), but not mindful parenting (F = 2.32, p = 0.131), compared to those of the TAU group. Improvements in general mindfulness and parental self-compassion mediated the effect of the Mindful Parenting Program on parental stress at posttreatment, with effect sizes of 0.46 and 0.46, respectively. For the MPP completers, improvements in general parental mindfulness, parental self-compassion, and mindful parenting correlated with improvements in their children's ADHD symptoms and behavioral symptoms. Correlation between the total practice times and outcome improvements was nonsignificant.Conclusions Our findings suggest that the Mindful Parenting Program may be effective for ameliorating parental stress among Chinese parents of children with ADHD.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - College students are experiencing heightened mental health difficulties, with problems intensifying during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a group intervention focused on cultivating mindfulness skills, with demonstrated efficacy in reducing psychopathology and bolstering mental health. This pilot randomized trial assessed the feasibility, engagement, and efficacy of an online adaptation of MBSR among healthy college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were randomly allocated to either an adapted MBSR group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 10). Participants completed mental health questionnaires prior to, and following the intervention. The intervention was demonstrated to be feasible and participants were engaged. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction participants reported greater increases over time in mindful self-compassion and observing mindfulness compared to control participants. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction participants demonstrated marginally greater overall mindfulness and well-being over time. This study identified small, clinically meaningful mental health effects of an online adaptation of MBSR among college students.

TI  - Digital mental health interventions for anxiety and depressive symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials
T2  - REVISTA DE PSIQUIATRIA Y SALUD MENTAL
M3  - Review
AB  - University students are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues, with anxiety and depression identified as the most common conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-isolation, and difficulties linked to online teaching and learning have increased their burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Thus, the urgent need to intervene in favour of these vulnerable subjects, together with the difficulties in delivering in-person interventions because of lockdowns and restrictions, has led to prioritize digital mental health strategies. This study aimed at systematically reviewing the existing literature on digital mental health interventions targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 emergency. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases identified eight randomized controlled trials. Regarding anxiety symptoms, digitally delivered cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and mind-body practice techniques emerged as valid strategies, while digital positive psychology and mindfulness-based interventions showed mixed results. On the other hand, digitally delivered dialectical behaviour therapy and positive psychology interventions have shown some efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms. Overall, the available literature, albeit of low quality, seems to support the role of digital interventions in promoting the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion Training Reduces Stress and Burnout Symptoms Among Practicing Psychologists: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Brief Web-Based Intervention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were (a) to examine the effects of a 6 weeks web-based mindful self-compassion program on stress and burnout symptoms in a group of practicing psychologists, and (b) to examine relationships between changes in self-compassion and self-coldness and changes in stress and burnout symptoms.Method: In a randomized controlled trial, 101 practicing psychologists were assigned to a training group (n = 51) or a wait-list control group (n = 49). The training encompassed 15min exercises per day, 6 days a week, for 6 weeks. The participants completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) pre and post intervention.Results: Eighty-one participants (n = 40 in the training group, n = 41 in the control group) took part in the pre and post intervention assessments. Selective gains for the intervention group were observed for SCS total scores (d = 0.86; d = 0.94 for the SCS), FFMQ scores (d = 0.60), while levels of self-coldness was reduced (d = 0.73). Critically, levels of perceived stress (d = 0.59) and burnout symptoms (d = 0.44 for SMBQ total) were additionally lowered post intervention. Finally, the results confirmed the hypothesis that the measures of distress would be more strongly related to self-coldness than self-compassion, a pattern seen in cross-sectional analyses and, for burnout, also in the longitudinal analyses.Conclusions: This training program appeared effective to increase self-compassion/reduce self-coldness, and to alleviate stress and symptoms of burnout and provide support of the distinction between self-compassion and self-coldness. Additional studies, preferably three-armed RCTs with long-term follow-up, are warranted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the program.

TI  - Cultivating mindfulness: Effects on well-being
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been great interest in determining if mindfulness can be cultivated and if this cultivation leads to well-being. The current study offers preliminary evidence that at least one aspect of mindfulness, measured by the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; K. W. Brown & R. M. Byan, 2003), can be cultivated and does mediate positive outcomes. Further, adherence to the practices taught during the meditation-based interventions predicted positive outcomes. College undergraduates were randomly allocated between training in two distinct meditation-based interventions, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR,- J. Kabat-Zinn, 1990; n = 15) and E. Easwaran's (1978/1991) Eight Point Program (EPP,- n = 14), or a waitlist control (n = 15). Pretest, posttest, and 8-week follow-up data were gathered on self-report outcome measures. Compared to controls, participants in both treatment groups (n=29) demonstrated increases in mindfulness at 8-week follow-up. Further, increases in mindfulness mediated reductions in perceived stress and rumination. These results suggest that distinct meditation-based practices can increase mindfulness as measured by the MAAS, which may partly mediate benefits. Implications and future directions are discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Psychedelic and mindfulness interventions have been shown to improve mental ill-health and wellbeing, with a range of clinical processes and effects in common. However, each appear to contain specific challenges in the context of mental health treatment. In this Perspective, we focus on a set of distinct affordances, "useful differences", within psychedelic and mindfulness interventions that might address common challenges within the other intervention. Accordingly, we propose a set of applied synergies, indicating specific ways in which these two promising interventions might be combined for greater benefit. Metaphorically, on the journey toward mental health and wellbeing, we propose that psychedelic treatments may serve the role of Compass (initiating, motivating, and steering the course of mindfulness practice), with mindfulness interventions serving the role of Vehicle (integrating, deepening, generalizing, and maintaining the novel perspectives and motivation instigated by psychedelic experience). We outline a set of testable hypotheses and future research associated with the synergistic action of psychedelic and mindfulness interventions toward improved clinical outcomes.

TI  - An electrophysiological investigation on the emotion regulatory mechanisms of brief open monitoring meditation in novice non-meditators
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a growing literature supporting the salutary effects of mindfulness meditation on emotion regulation, the underlying mechanisms linking neural and subjective changes occurring during the actual practice of meditation with emotion regulatory effects observed after meditation remains virtually unexplored. The current study sought to address this gap in knowledge by testing the hypothesis that adoption of internally-directed focused attention, indexed by increased alpha and theta spectral power, during brief open monitoring (OM) mindfulness meditation predicts reduced emotional reactivity, as measured by the late positive potential (LPP). Results revealed that the OM meditation did not produce demonstrable differences in alpha and theta power but did increase self-reported sleepiness relative to controls. Follow-up analyses showed that sleepiness uniquely moderated the effect of meditation on the LPP, such that less sleepiness during meditation, but not the control audio, corresponded to smaller LPPs to negative images. Change in theta, but not alpha power, between meditation and rest was positively correlated with the LPP even after controlling for sleepiness. Although the primary hypothesis was unsupported, the findings demonstrate that phenomenological and neural changes occurring during OM meditation may modulate its subsequent "off-the-cushion" effects on emotional reactivity.

TI  - Workplace stress, burnout and coping: a qualitative study of the experiences of Australian disability support workers
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disability support workers (DSWs) are the backbone of contemporary disability support services and the interface through which disability philosophies and policies are translated into practical action. DSWs often experience workplace stress and burnout, resulting in a high turnover rate of employees within the non-professional disability service workforce. The full implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme in Australia is set to intensify the current challenges of attracting and retaining DSWs, as the role becomes characterised by greater demands, ambiguity and conflict. The aim of this study was to explore DSWs' perceptions of enjoyable and challenging aspects of disability support work, sources of stress and burnout and the strategies they use to cope when these issues arise. Twelve DSWs workers providing support for adults living with intellectual and physical disabilities were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed a superordinate theme of 'Balance' comprising three sub-themes: 'Balancing Negatives and Positives', 'Periods of Imbalance', and 'Strategies to Reclaim Balance'. Participants spoke of the rewarding and uplifting times in their job such as watching a client learn new skills and being shown appreciation. These moments were contrasted by emotionally and physically draining aspects of their work, including challenging client behaviour, earning a low income, and having limited power to make decisions. Participants described periods of imbalance, wherein the negatives of their job outweighed the positives, resulting in stress and sometimes burnout. Participants often had to actively seek support and tended to rely on their own strategies to manage stress. Findings suggest that organisational support together with workplace interventions that support DSWs to perceive the positive aspects of their work, such as acceptance and mindfulness-based approaches, may help to limit experiences of stress and burnout. The further development and evaluation of emotion-focused workplace therapies, and interventions that consider organisational (macro) factors is suggested.

TI  - A Web-Based, Mindful, and Compassionate Parenting Training for Mothers Experiencing Parenting Stress: Results from a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of the Mindful Moment Program
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Mindful Moment is a self-guided, web-based, mindful, and compassionate parenting training for postpartum mothers who experience parenting stress. We aimed to assess Mindful Moment's feasibility, acceptability, and usability, and to gather preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in reducing parenting stress and outcomes such as mindful parenting, self-compassion, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, dispositional mindfulness, mother's perception of infant temperament, and mother-infant bonding.Methods This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was a two-arm trial and followed the CONSORT 2010, CONSORT-EHEALTH, and CONSORT-SPI 2018 extension guidelines. A total of 292 Portuguese mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 146) or to the waiting list control group (n = 146) and completed baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2) self-reported assessments.Results A total of 31 mothers (21.23%) completed the Mindful Moment intervention. Most mothers evaluated the program as good or excellent (90%), considered that Mindful Moment provided them the kind of help they expected or wanted (61%), were satisfied with the help provided by the program (74.6%), would recommend it to a friend in a similar situation (86.4%), and would use it again if needed (81.4%). Regarding the program's preliminary effectiveness, mothers in the intervention group presented a greater decrease in parenting stress, a greater increase in dispositional mindfulness, and a greater decrease in their perception of the difficult temperament of their infants from T1 to T2.Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence of the Mindful Moment's effectiveness and suggests that it is a feasible and acceptable program for postpartum mothers experiencing parenting stress. Further research is needed to confirm these results in a larger RCT.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on emotional experience and expression: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to reduce psychological distress and improve psychological adjustment in medical, psychiatric, and nonclinical samples. We examined its effects on several processes, attitudes, and behavior patterns related to emotion regulation. Design: Fifty-six adults were randomly assigned to MBSR or to a waiting list (WL). Results: Compared with WL completers (n = 21), MBSR completers (n = 20) reported significantly greater increases in trait mindfulness and decreases in absent-mindedness, greater increases in self-compassion, and decreases in fear of emotions, suppression of anger, aggressive anger expression, worry, and difficulties regulating emotions. The WL group subsequently received MBSR, and the two groups combined showed significant changes on all of these variables from pre-MBSR to post-MBSR, and on all except the 2 anger variables from pre-test to 2-month follow-up, as well as significant reductions in rumination. Conclusion: An 8-week mindfulness training program might increase mindful awareness in daily life and have beneficial impact on clinically relevant emotion regulation processes.

TI  - Helping People by Being in the Present: Mindfulness Increases Prosocial Behavior
T2  - ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research tested whether mindfulness, a state characterized by focused, nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, increases prosocial behavior in the workplace or work-related contexts. Study 1a was a longitudinal field experiment at a US insurance company. Compared to workers under waitlist control, employees who were assigned to a daily mindfulness training reported more helping behaviors over a five day period both in quantitative surveys and qualitative daily diaries. Study 1b, conducted in a large consulting company in India, extends these findings with a field experiment in which co-workers rated the prosocial behavior of teammates in a round robin design. Moving from devoting time to devoting money, in Studies 2a and 2b we find that individuals randomly assigned to engage in a focused breathing meditation were more financially generous. To understand the mechanisms of mindfulness' effects on prosocial behavior, Study 3 found support for empathy and moderate support for perspective taking as mediators. This study also examined the effects of induced state mindfulness via two different mindfulness inductions, focused breathing and loving kindness meditation. Our results indicate that secular state mindfulness can make people more other-oriented and helpful. This benefit holds even in the workplace, where being helpful toward others might face constraints but is nevertheless of great importance.

TI  - Yoga and Mindfulness Training for Professional Baseball Players: A Narrative Study on Perspectives and Practices.
T2  - International journal of yoga therapy
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mindfulness-related practices (e.g., yoga) appear aligned with the field of athletic performance in developing sport-related capacities such as attention regulation, volition, perception, and coping. The purpose of the present narrative study was to explore the experiences of professional baseball players who interacted with the ideas and practices of mindfulness presented in classes featuring yoga and Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC). Participants were seven Minor League Baseball players who learned mindfulness practices in off-season instructional classes and then completed semi-structured episodic interviews on how their mindfulness practices were perceived and utilized in training and competition during the baseball season. Data were analyzed using the three-dimensional space approach to examine participants' subjective accounts of experience, behavior, environmental conditions, and external events. Individual narratives were re-storied and themed. Results indicated various themes across settings, from players' experiences in the yoga/MAC classes (effect of breath regulation on coping strategies; self-awareness and the mind-body connection), on the baseball field (confidence and self-efficacy; self-regulation; resilience and positive coping strategies), and off the baseball field (everyday life and activities; stigma of mental training). Overall, participants appeared to be accepting of mindfulness integrated into their training and provided perspectives supporting the benefits of yoga/MAC classes. This study has research and practice implications in incorporating yoga and mindfulness-based practices in athletic performance among young professional athletes.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Movement: A Polyvagal Perspective
T2  - INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Compelling evidence suggests that physical activity is an effective intervention for cancer survivors, including for those undergoing active cancer treatments. However, to date most evidence has emerged from interventions that have promoted moderate to vigorous physical activity. In this conceptual review, we argue that attention should be given to the entire continuum of physical activity from reducing sedentary behavior to increasing higher levels of physical activity when possible. In addition, considerable evidence in the cancer literature supports the value of mindfulness-based interventions as a means of helping patients and survivors cope with the variety of threats that accompany this disease. Based on the success of these two areas of research, we argue for conceptualizing and promoting physical activity as Mindfulness-Based Movement, using Polyvagal Theory as a theoretical framework to understand the role and value of Mindfulness-Based Movement as a potential intervention for cancer care and control.

TI  - Incremental validity of mindfulness-based attention in relation to the concurrent prediction of anxiety and depressive symptomatology and perceptions of health
T2  - Cognitive Behaviour Therapy
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation evaluated the role of mindfulness-based attention in concurrently predicting anxiety and depressive symptomatology and perceived health functioning in a community sample of 170 young adults (95 females; mean age (M-age) = 22.2 years, SD = 7.6). Partially consistent with prediction, results indicated that, relative to negative and positive affectivity and emotional expression and processing associated with approach-oriented coping, mindfulness-based attention incrementally predicted anhedonic depressive, but not anxious arousal, symptoms. Additionally, consistent with prediction, mindfulness-based attention demonstrated incremental validity in relation to perceived health, and the degree of impairment of health in terms of physical and mental functioning. Results are discussed in relation to the construct development of mindfulness-based attention, and specifically, the role(s) of this factor in emotional and physical health processes.

TI  - Online self-compassion training to improve the wellbeing of youth with chronic medical conditions: protocol for a randomised control trial
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Chronic medical conditions (CMCs) affect up to 35% of children and adolescents. Youth with chronic medical conditions are at an increased risk of psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life, and report rates of mental illness up to double that of their physically healthy peers. Accessible, evidence-based interventions for young people with chronic illness are urgently required to improve their mental health and daily functioning. Self-compassion involves taking a mindful, accepting approach to difficult experiences, being aware that one is not alone in one's suffering, and being kind and understanding with oneself during challenging times. Self-compassion shares strong associations with mental health outcomes among young people and preliminary work indicates that interventions that build self-compassion have the potential to substantially improve youth mental health. Self-compassion is also associated with better physical and mental health outcomes among individuals living with CMCs. While face-to-face self-compassion training is available, there are several barriers to access for youth with CMCs. Online self-compassion training potentially offers an accessible alternative for this high-risk group. Methods Self-Compassion Online (SCO) is a self-compassion program that has been tested with a non-clinical adult group. For the proposed trial, a reference group of youth (16-25 years) with chronic illness reviewed the program and proposed adaptations to improve its suitability for youth with chronic illness. In alignment with the SPIRIT Checklist, this paper outlines the protocol for a CONSORT-compliant, single-blind randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of the adapted program, relative to a waitlist control, for improving self-compassion, wellbeing, distress, emotion regulation, coping and quality of life among young Australians with CMCs. Mechanisms of action and feasibility of SCO will be analysed using quantitative data and participant interviews, respectively. Finally, cost-utility will be analysed using health-related quality of life data. Discussion The SCO program could provide a scalable solution for improving psychological outcomes and quality of life among youth with chronic illness. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for improving these outcomes, relative to waitlist control.

TI  - Self-Compassion: Evaluation of a Psychoeducational Website
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Low levels of self-compassion are associated with a number of mental health problems. Recent findings suggest that self-compassion can be significantly increased through traditional therapist led interventions such as Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC). Aims: The goal of this study was to assess the impact of a psychoeducational website modeled on MSC on measured levels of self-compassion and two related constructs: shame and rumination. Method: Participants (N = 9) were recruited from a pool of university students and employees. Single case AB protocols were used. Results: Analyses using the Critical Difference statistic revealed significant improvement in self-compassion and shame for the majority of participants, but limited changes in rumination. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that self-compassion may be enhanced through the use of a psychoeducational website. It may be worthwhile to develop a structured internet-based treatment course for individuals who would not otherwise access traditional psychological services.

TI  - Cultivating Self-Care and Compassion in Psychological Therapists in Training: The Experience of Practicing Loving-Kindness Meditation
T2  - TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given significant rates of psychological distress in practicing psychological therapists, including those in training, there is a need to cultivate self-care and compassion during therapy training. Emerging research has suggested that loving-kindness meditation (LKM) increases well-being and compassion, thus, making it a potential tool to foster self-care in trainee therapists (TT). However, studies have also suggested difficulties in engaging with LKM. This study aimed to explore in-depth how a sample of TT experiences a course of LKM, using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Twelve TT who had previously attended a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course took part in a six-session LKM course and were interviewed about their experience. Five master themes were identified: (a) engaging with the practice, (b) impact on self, (c) impact on relationships, (d) bringing compassion into the therapy room, and (e) integrating LKM into life. Participants perceived LKM to have led to increased self-awareness, compassion for self and others, and therapeutic presence and skills. At the same time, LKM was experienced as emotionally challenging. The findings suggest that it may be useful to offer LKM to TT as an approach to enhancing self-care and compassion, but that it should be taught with care, given its potential emotional impact. Moreover, the findings provide a platform for future quantitative research in this area.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for lung cancer patients and their partners: Results of a mixed methods pilot study
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lung cancer patients and partners show high rates of impaired quality of life and heightened distress levels. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction has proven to be effective in reducing psychological distress in cancer patients. However, studies barely included lung cancer patients.Aim: We examined whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction might be a feasible and effective intervention for patients with lung cancer and partners.Design: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is a training in which mindfulness practices are combined with psycho-education to help participants cope with distress. In this mixed methods pilot study, questionnaires on psychological distress and quality of life were administered before, directly after and 3months after the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training, in combination with semi-structured interviews.Setting/participants: Patients with lung cancer and partners were recruited at one tertiary care academic medical centre. A total of 19 lung cancer patients and 16 partners participated in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training.Results: Most patients were diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer. Vast majority completed the training. Those receiving anti-cancer treatment did not miss more sessions than patients who were not currently treated. Patients and partners felt positive about participating in a peer group and with their partner. Among participants no significant changes were found in psychological distress. Caregiver burden in partners decreased significantly after following Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. The qualitative analysis showed that the training seemed to instigate a process of change in participants.Conclusion: The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training seemed to be feasible for patients with lung cancer and their partners. A randomized controlled trial is needed to examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction in reducing psychological distress in lung cancer patients and partners.

TI  - Self-Compassion: Theory, Method, Research, and Intervention
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Self-compassion refers to being supportive toward oneself when experiencing suffering or pain-be it caused by personal mistakes and inadequacies or external life challenges. This review presents my theoretical model of self-compassion as comprised of six different elements: increased self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness as well as reduced self-judgment, isolation, and overidentification. It discusses the methodology of self-compassion research and reviews the increasingly large number of empirical studies that indicate self-compassion is a productive way of approaching distressing thoughts and emotions that engenders mental and physical well-being. It also reviews research that dispels common myths about self-compassion (e.g., that it is weak, selfish, self-indulgent or undermines motivation). Interventions designed to increase self-compassion, such as compassion-focused therapy and mindful self-compassion, are discussed. Finally, the review considers problematic issues in the field, such as the differential effects fallacy, and considers limitations and future research directions in the field of self-compassion research.

TI  - Effects of Taiji Practice on Mindfulness and Self-Compassion in Healthy Participants-A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Taiji is regarded as a mind-body practice that is characterized by gentle and mindful body movements. In contrast to the continuously growing evidence base supporting the beneficial effects of Taiji on physical and mental well-being, studies investigating its underlying mechanisms are still scarce. The aim of our study was to examine the impact of Taiji practice on self-attribution of mindfulness and self-compassion, two potential components well known for their health promoting effects. Seventy healthy participants (age range: 23-50 years) were randomly assigned either to the intervention group or to a wait list control group. The intervention group attended Taiji classes twice a week for 3 months. Before, shortly after and 2 months after the intervention, we measured the degree of self-attributed mindfulness and self-compassion in all study participants by using self-report questionnaires. Compared to the control group, the intervention group showed significantly higher increase scores in self-attributed mindfulness after the intervention that persisted 2 months later. Increases in self-attributed self-compassion were also higher in Taiji practitioners, with significant group differences from preintervention to follow-up assessment. Our findings suggest that Taiji practice can effectively enhance self-attribution of mindfulness and is likely to have beneficial effects on self-compassion in healthy participants. The role of mindfulness as a mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of Taiji practice warrants further research.

TI  - Mindfulness and Coaching to Improve Learning Abilities in University Students: A Pilot Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This pilot study investigated the effects of a short 10-module intervention called MEL (Mindful Effective Learning), which integrates mindfulness, coaching, and training on study strategies, to improve learning abilities among university students. Inspired by ample research on the learning topics that points out how effective learning and good academic results depend simultaneously on self-regulation while studying combined with emotional and motivational factors, the intervention aimed to train students simultaneously in these three aspects. The intervention group participants (N = 21) and the control group participants (N = 24) were surveyed pre- and post-intervention with the Italian questionnaire AMOS (Abilities and Motivation to Study) and the Italian version of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). The results showed that, regarding self-regulation in study, trained students improved their self-awareness, self-evaluation ability, metacognition skills, and organizational and elaborative ability to manage study materials; regarding emotional aspects, they improved their anxiety control; regarding motivation they developed an incremental theory of Self and improved their confidence in their own intelligence. Moreover, two follow-up self-report surveys were conducted, and trained students reported positive assessments of the MEL intervention. Findings suggest that a short intervention based on mindfulness and coaching and training on study strategies may improve students' effective learning.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) Training Are Equally Beneficial for Mothers and Their Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder or With Intellectual Disabilities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disabilities (IDs) can be stressful for many parents. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) is a customized mindfulness program that enables parents and other caregivers to reduce their perceived psychological stress to normative levels through mindfulness procedures and to support children with ASD or ID to self-manage their challenging behaviors through positive behavior support (PBS). In this study, we evaluated whether MBPBS would have differential effects on the stress levels of mothers of adolescents with ASD (n = 47) or with ID (n = 45) and the effects of the program on the aggressive, disruptive, and compliance behaviors of their children. Both groups of mothers participated in the 40-week study (10 weeks control and 30 weeks MBPBS program), rated their own stress levels, and collected daily observational data on the adolescents' behavior. Results showed significant reductions in the level of stress in both groups of mothers, but no differential effects on mothers of children with ASD or with ID. In addition, significant reductions in aggression and disruptive behavior and increases in compliance behaviors were observed in the adolescents in both groups. The results suggest that MBPBS is equally beneficial for mothers of adolescents with ASD or ID. In the present study, although the mothers of children with ID had slightly higher levels of stress at baseline and mothers of children with ASD had lower levels of stress following the MBPBS program, the program can be considered equally effective in reducing the stress levels of both groups of mothers. This suggests that the program may be effective regardless of baseline levels of mothers' stress.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in High School and College Athletes for Reducing Stress and Injury, and Improving Quality of Life
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORT REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical Scenario: Student athletes experience a variety of stressors from school and social activities, as well as the additional demands of sport participation. Mindfulness-based interventions can help increase mental awareness and acceptance, as well as mitigate negative thoughts and emotions. The use of mindfulness-based interventions may be beneficial for reducing thoughts of stress, injury reduction, and improving overall wellbeing. Clinical Question: Does the use of mindfulness-based interventions for student-athletes aged 13-24 years reduce stress and injury as well as improve overall quality of life? Summary of Findings: The literature was searched for studies that investigated the use of mindfulness-based strategies for student-athletes specifically for reducing stress and injury and/or improving quality of life. The literature search returned 8 possible studies related to the clinical question and 3 studies met the inclusion criteria (1 randomized control trial, 2 nonrandomized control cohort studies). All 3 included studies demonstrated overall improved levels of mindfulness among student-athletes after the use of a mindfulness-based intervention. Mindfulness-based interventions had positive effects for reducing negative thoughts and levels of perceived stress. The number of injury occurrences were found to decrease following the integration of a mindfulness-based intervention within an athletic population. Clinical Bottom Line: There is sufficient evidence supporting the use of mindfulness-based interventions with student-athletes for increasing mindfulness, managing negative emotions and perceived stress, as well as improving overall well-being. There is also current literature that advocates the use of mindfulness-based interventions for reducing injury, but further research is needed for support. Strength of Recommendation: Grade B evidence exists to support that the use of mindfulness-based interventions for student-athletes will reduce stress and improve overall well-being as well as support the possibility that if a student-athlete is more mindful, it may help decrease risk of injury incurred if the student-athlete is under mental stress.

TI  - Impact of a Mindfulness-Based, Workplace Group Yoga Intervention on Burnout, Self-Care, and Compassion in Health Care Professionals <i>A Pilot Study</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate whether a workplace, group mindfulness-based yoga intervention could help manage burnout and improve wellbeing among health care professionals. Methods: A total of 43 health care professionals participated in 8-week supervised workplace, group mindfulness-based yoga activities. The authors used a single-sample, pre-post design. At two points in time (baseline and postintervention), participants completed a set of online measures assessing burnout, depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, and compassion. The authors used linear mixed model analysis to assess changes in outcome measures. Results: Participants had improvements after the 8-week intervention. At postintervention, they had significantly better scores on personal accomplishment, depression, anxiety, stress, perceived resilience, and compassion. Participants had a positive perception of the yoga intervention. Conclusion: Group mindfulness-based yoga program may be convenient and low-cost approach to support health and wellbeing among health care professionals.

TI  - Potential Therapeutic Effects of Meditation for Treating Affective Dysregulation
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Affective dysregulation is at the root of many psychopathologies, including stress induced disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. The root of these disorders appears to be an attenuated, top-down cognitive control from the prefrontal cortices over the maladaptive subcortical emotional processing. A form of mental training, long-term meditation practice can trigger meditation-specific neuroplastic changes in the brain regions underlying cognitive control and affective regulation, suggesting that meditation can act as a kind of mental exercise to foster affective regulation and possibly a cost-effective intervention in mood disorders. Increasing research has suggested that the cultivation of awareness and acceptance along with a nonjudgmental attitude via meditation promotes adaptive affective regulation. This review examined the concepts of affective regulation and meditation and discussed behavioral and neural evidence of the potential clinical application of meditation. Lately, there has been a growing trend toward incorporating the "mindfulness" component into existing psychotherapeutic treatment. Promising results have been observed thus far. Future studies may consider exploring the possibility of integrating the element of "compassion" into current psychotherapeutic approaches.

TI  - The effect of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program on students' test performance
T2  - International Journal of Sustainable Economy
M3  - Journal Paper
AB  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), one of the most widely used mental training programs, has been reported to produce positive effects on psychological well-being and to ameliorate symptoms of a number of disorders. The current article seeks to explore if it can be scientifically determined that through mental training people can be led to act in a more sustainable manner with their mental forces and, at the same time, be significantly more efficient. The study sought to investigate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction on bachelor-level students' weekly test results. The results showed that there are significant differences between the experimental and the control group. Mindfulness-based stress reduction was influential in achieving higher scores and grades thus supporting our research hypothesis. Accordingly, the current article demonstrates that training of mindfulness-based stress reduction can be successful in coping effectively with testing conditions that are conducted under time constraints.

TI  - Open, Aware, and Active: Contextual Approaches as an Emerging Trend in the Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - A wave of new developments has occurred in the behavioral and cognitive therapies that focuses on processes such as acceptance, mindfulness, attention, or values. In this review, we describe some of these developments and the data regarding them, focusing on information about components, moderators, mediators, and processes of change. These "third wave" methods all emphasize the context and function of psychological events more so than their validity, frequency, or form, and for these reasons we use the term "contextual cognitive behavioral therapy" to describe their characteristics. Both putative processes, and component and process evidence, indicate that they are focused on establishing a more open, aware, and active approach to living, and that their positive effects occur because of changes in these processes.

TI  - A mindfulness-oriented psycho-behavioral intervention for patients with acute coronary syndrome: A pilot study
T2  - HEART & LUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: People frequently experience physical and psychological challenges (e.g., depression and anxiety) and high risk of poor prognosis after an acute coronary event. Mindfulness-based intervention holds promise as an effective approach to promoting health and well-being.Objectives: To explore the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects on psychological distress, cardiovascular risk factors and health-related quality of life of a mindfulness-oriented psycho-behavioral intervention for patients with acute coronary syndrome.Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability and potential effects of the intervention in 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The intervention included six weekly sessions, including one face-to-face session and five WeChat-delivered sessions that incorporated mindfulness training with health education and lifestyle modification. Eligible patients were recruited in two public hospitals in China and randomly allocated into the intervention group (n = 25) or control group (n = 25).Results: Intervention feasibility was supported by a relatively high recruitment rate (66.7%) and retention rate (84%) and a smooth and brief data collection procedure (15 to 25 min) of the pilot study. Positive responses of the acceptability dichotomous scale ranged from 81% to 100%, suggesting the intervention was generally acceptable. The intervention had a significant group x time effect on dietary behavior (B = 0.31,95% CI: 0.08, 0.54, P = 0.008) with an effect size (Cohen's d) of-0.72.Conclusions: The mindfulness-oriented psycho-behavioral intervention appears to be feasible and acceptable and have a promising effect on dietary behavior in patients with acute coronary syndrome. A fully powered randomized controlled trial is warranted to further assess the efficacy of the intervention.

TI  - Comparative Effectiveness of Caregiver Training in Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and Positive Behavior Support (PBS) in a Randomized Controlled Trial.
T2  - Mindfulness
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are often stressed due to the demands of the job, including the nature and severity of challenging behaviors of the clients, work conditions, degree of management support for the staff, and the demands of implementing some interventions under adverse conditions. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and PBS alone have been shown to be effective in assisting caregivers to better manage the challenging behaviors of clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The aim of the present study was to undertake a head-to-head assessment of the effectiveness of MBPBS and PBS alone in a 40-week randomized controlled trial. Of the 123 caregivers who met inclusion criteria, 60 were randomly assigned to MBPBS and 63 to PBS alone, with 59 completing the trial in the MBPBS condition and 57 in the PBS alone condition. Results showed both interventions to be effective, but the caregiver, client, and agency outcomes for MBPBS were uniformly superior to those of PBS alone condition. In addition, the MBPBS training was substantially more cost-effective than the PBS alone training. The present results add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of MBPBS and, if independently replicated, could provide an integrative health care approach in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities.

TI  - Making concrete construals mindful: A novel approach for developing mindfulness and self-compassion to assist weight loss
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the usefulness of mindfulness and self-compassion for dieting has focused on meditative practices. However, meditation can be difficult to maintain, especially while dieting. Thus, the present research attempted to induce mindfulness and self-compassion by using food diaries that required the participant to either focus on concrete (i.e. how they are eating) construals or abstract (i.e. why they are eating) construals. The concrete construals were expected to increase mindfulness and self-compassion, as well as decrease avoidance and negative thoughts (which would further aid the development of mindfulness and self-compassion). Study 1 found that mindfulness and self-compassion mediated the inverse relationship of avoidance and negative thoughts with weight loss. Study 2 showed that concrete construal diaries increased mindfulness and self-compassion, decreased avoidance and negative thoughts, and supported weight loss significantly more than the abstract construal diaries. Study 3, then, compared the concrete construal diaries with a mindful self-compassionate meditation programme. There was no difference in weight loss at the end of the intervention, but at a three-month follow-up, the diaries performed better at weight maintenance. Thus, the concrete construal diaries may promote mindfulness and self-compassion and potentially promote long-term weight loss.

TI  - Effects of a Virtual Mindful Self-Compassion Training on Mindfulness, Self-compassion, Empathy, Well-being, and Stress in Uruguayan Primary School Teachers During COVID-19 Times
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the effects of a virtual Mindful Self-compassion (MSC) intervention on mindfulness and self-compassion, empathy, stress, and well-being in Uruguayan primary school teachers, during COVID-19 times.MethodA quasi-experimental, longitudinal study was conducted with an active control intervention that involved practicing Kundalini yoga (KY). Uruguayan volunteer female teachers were randomly assigned to MSC or KY 9-week virtual training. They completed self-reported psychometric tests and an empathy for pain task (EPT) at pre- and post-training, and follow-up (3 months).ResultsAt post-MSC training, mindfulness (observing, non-reactivity, and total mindfulness) and self-compassion (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, and self-judgment) increased. The empathy dimensions perspective-taking increased and personal distress decreased. Stress decreased and well-being increased. Concerning EPT, the accuracy in attributing intentionality to the harm inflicted, i.e., the intentionality comprehension accuracy, increased. At follow-up, observing and total mindfulness remained elevated, and non-judging increased. Common humanity remained elevated and personal distress remained decreased. Comparing MSC with KY trainings at post-training, the psychometric tests showed that personal distress was lower in the MSC group. At follow-up, observing and total mindfulness were higher in the MSC group. No differences between groups were found for the EPT at post-training and follow-up.ConclusionsVirtual MSC training increased mindfulness and self-compassion, associated with higher well-being, reduced stress, and increased empathy in primary school teachers in Uruguay.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

TI  - Mindful self-compassion training program in the family caregivers of patients with cancer: a quasi-experimental study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeHigh levels of depression and anxiety in the family caregivers of a patient with cancer affect their quality of life. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a mindful self-compassion (MSC) training program on self-compassion in the family caregivers of patients with cancer. Design/methodology/approachIn 2020, this quasi-experimental study used convenience sampling to select 92 family caregivers of patients with cancer presenting to the oncology ward of Seyed-Al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. The subjects randomly assigned to two groups participated in an online MSC program for 1.5 months. All the participants completed a self-compassion scale (Neff) before, immediately after and one month after the intervention. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Chi-squared test, the LSD test, the t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. FindingsThe total mean score of self-compassion, respectively, obtained as 64.64 +/- 8.23 and 64.44 +/- 4.94 in the experimental and control groups before the intervention significantly increased to 81.15 +/- 7.94 and 64.06 +/- 5.22 immediately after and 78.94 +/- 8.22 and 64.22 +/- 4.85 one month after the intervention (P < 0.001). Practical implicationsGiven the potential for negative psychological impacts for patients, caregivers and clinicians in cancer care, the online MSC program can be recommended to support and reduce psychological distress in them. Originality/valueThis paper examined the effect of the online MSC program on self-compassion in the family caregivers of patients with cancer and can contribute to our understanding of the value of integrating mental health of caregivers and care of patients with cancer.

TI  - Longitudinal associations between psychedelic use and meditation practices in the United States and the United Kingdom
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Previous research has proposed that there may be potential synergies between psychedelic and meditation interventions, but there are still knowledge gaps that merit further investigation.Methods. Using a longitudinal observational research design with samples representative of the US and UK adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 9732), we investigated potential associations between self-reported psychedelic use and meditation practice.Results. The follow-up survey was completed by 7667 respondents (79% retention rate), with 100 respondents reporting psychedelic use during the 2-month study period (1.3% of follow-up respondents). In covariate-adjusted regression models, psychedelic use during the study period was associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.40, p = 0.004). Among those who reported psychedelic use during the study period, covariate-adjusted regression models revealed that the subjective experience of insight during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in that period was also associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness and loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.42, p = 0.021; B = 0.38, p = 0.017). Notably, more days of loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week at baseline was associated with less severe subjective feelings of death or dying during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in the study period (B = -0.29, p = 0.037).Conclusions. Psychedelic use might lead to greater engagement with meditation practices such as mindfulness meditation, while meditation practices such as loving-kindness or compassion medication might buffer against certain challenging experiences associated with psychedelic use.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness-based intervention in social workers working during the COVID-19 crisis
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the frontline professionals during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, social workers can face tremendous pressure, which can lead to mental health problems. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a brief mindfulness-based intervention had short- and middle-term effects on social workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a randomized controlled trial, 49 social workers were assigned to an experimental group (n = 28) or a waitlist control group (n = 21). The intervention was a four-week mindfulness-based program. The outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-test, and at one-month follow-up test. At post-test and follow-up, the workers in the experimental group reported higher mean scores in psychological flexibility and self-compassion and lower mean scores in depression compared to the workers in the waitlist control group. Although the experimental group also showed lower mean scores than the waitlist control group in anxiety and stress at both post-test and follow, the differences were not statistically significant. The findings suggest that a brief mindfulness-based intervention can improve psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and depression in social workers working during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to protected mental health, adding support to continuing development of such efficient mindfulness-based programs. Future studies should use larger samples and examine brief interventions' working mechanisms.

TI  - A systematic review of the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions following transient ischemic attack and stroke
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundRecent epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between perceived psychological stress and ischemic stroke. A feature of stroke is recurrence; 30-40% within five-years following first transient ischemic attack/stroke. Equipping patients with skills and coping strategies to help reduce or manage perceived psychological stress may represent an important secondary prevention intervention. Mindfulness-based interventions are structured, group-based self-management programmes with potential to help people with long-term conditions cope better with physical, psychological, or emotional distress. Review evidence suggests significant benefits across a range of physical and mental health problems. However, we could find no evidence synthesis relating specifically to the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions following transient ischemic attack/stroke.AimThe review aims to evaluate the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions following transient ischemic attack/stroke.MethodsSix major databases were searched using subject headings and key words. Papers were screened using review-specific criteria. Critical appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Statistical meta-analysis was not possible; therefore findings are presented in narrative form.ResultsFour studies involving 160 participants were reviewed. Three papers reported mindfulness-based interventions delivered to groups; one paper reported a mindfulness-based intervention which was delivered one to one. The results demonstrate a positive trend in favor of the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions across a range of psychological, physiological, and psychosocial outcomes including anxiety, depression, mental fatigue, blood pressure, perceived health, and quality of life. No evidence of harm was found.Conclusion Following transient ischemic attack/stroke, people may derive a range of benefits from mindfulness-based interventions; however, further methodologically robust trials are required.

TI  - Improving Mental Health Among Transgender Adolescents: Implementing Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of an online self-compassion intervention for transgender adolescents, with the aim of improving mental health. Participants identified as transgender or gender expansive, were between the ages of 13 and 17, and lived in the U.S. or Canada. The empirically-based self-compassion program, Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens (formerly Making Friends with Yourself) was implemented in eight 1.5 hour sessions on the Zoom platform by two trained instructors. Surveys were administered pre-, post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up, and qualitative data were collected through end-of-program interviews and open-ended questions on the post-survey. All protocols were approved by the university IRB. Quantitative data analysis included repeated measures ANOVAs, and qualitative data were analyzed via both inductive and deductive methods. Results indicated that all but one psychosocial measure significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention, which then significantly improved at 3-month follow-up; most other improvements were maintained at follow-up. Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: virtual safe space; connection to body; personal growth; and recommended course changes and are discussed. Results suggest that self-compassion interventions can be incorporated into therapy programs to support and improve mental health for transgender adolescents.

TI  - Mindful self-compassion intervention among young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment: Reducing psychopathological symptoms, shame, and self-criticism
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Child maltreatment has long-term destructive effects on a person's psychological health. Therefore, it seems necessary to take interventions to reduce psychological symptoms and regulate the emotion of these people. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program on reducing psychopathological symptoms, shame, and self-criticism in young adults with a history of childhood maltreatment. The research plan was a semi-experimental design with a control group. Forty-four eligible young adults in Isfahan (Iran) enrolled in an MSC course. The participants consisted of 19 males (43%) and 25 females (57%) from 18 to 25 years old. They were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 24) and control (N = 23) groups. The experimental group participated in eight 2-h sessions of the MSC program. The results indicated that the experimental group showed a significant decrease in anxiety (p < .001), depression (p < .01), internal shame (p < .05), self-criticism (p < .000), and a significant increase in self-compassion (p < .01) compared to the control group in both post-test and follow-up. Also, a significant reduction was observed in external shame (p < .001) and stress (p < .01) in the experimental group immediately after the end of the intervention but there were no long-term effects at the two-month follow-up (P > .05). Based on the findings, it can be concluded that MCS can improve depression, anxiety, self-criticism, internal shame, and self-compassion in young adults with childhood maltreatment. Further studies with longer follow-up periods and larger sample groups with different demographics need to be conducted to confirm these findings.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy with Older Adults: A Qualitative Review of Randomized Controlled Outcome Research
T2  - CLINICAL GERONTOLOGIST
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Many older adults cope with various chronic physical health conditions, and in some cases, with mental health and/or cognitive difficulties. Mindfulness-based interventions offer an evidence-based, mind-body complementary treatment approach for a wide range of comorbidities, yet most investigations were conducted with young or middle-aged adults. The purpose of this review was to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two leading mindfulness-based interventions conducted with older adults. Methods: Our search of five databases identified seven RCT investigations of either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) conducted exclusively with older adults. Results: Results generally supported the use of MBSR for chronic low back pain, chronic insomnia, improved sleep quality, enhanced positive affect, reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improved memory and executive functioning. In a sample of older adults exhibiting elevated anxiety in the absence of elevated depression, MBCT effectively reduced symptoms of anxiety. Conclusions: This review highlights the feasibility and possible benefits of MBSR and MBCT for older adults. Additional large scale RCTs conducted with older adults coping with the range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive challenges older adults commonly face still are needed.

T2  - APPLIED NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction on objective and subjective sleep parameters and hypnotic medication use of patients with insomnia secondary to cervical cancer.Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial enrolled insomnia patient who were caused or worsened by cervical cancer. Seventy patients with insomnia caused or aggravated by cervical cancer were at random divided into either a usual care group or an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction group. Subjective sleep parameters, objective sleep parameters and hypnotic medication consumption were assessed at baseline, after the program, 6- and 12-month after finishing the interventions.Results: The results showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction had a positive effect on subjective sleep parameters (Total wake time: Delta = 45.32, P < 0.05; Sleep efficacy: Delta = 6.87, P < 0.05; Total sleep time: Delta = 22.22, P < 0.01). Compared with control group, polysomnography data in mindfulness-based stress reduction group were not improved significantly. There were no associations between subjective sleep parameters and objective sleep parameters.Conclusion: Mindfulness-based stress reduction had a definite impact on patients with insomnia that was secondary to cervical cancer just after the intervention, but no long-term influences.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently, the psychological construct mindfulness has received a great deal of attention. The majority of research has focused on clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions This line of research has led to promising data suggesting mindfulness-based interventions are effective for treatment of both psychological and physical symptoms. However, an equally important direction for future research is to investigate questions concerning mechanisms of action underlying mindfulness-based interventions. This theoretical paper proposes a model of mindfulness, in an effort to elucidate potential mechanisms to explain how mindfulness affects positive change. Potential implications and future directions for the empirical study of mechanisms involved in mindfulness are addressed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Science-Based Buddhist Practice: an Illustration Using Doctrinal Charts of Won Buddhism
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of mindfulness-based interventions as an effective approach to address psychological distress and improve well-being has stimulated the development of a multitude of programs, each designed for specific applications. While many mindfulness-based interventions are focused on addressing particular psychological needs, so-called second-generation mindfulness-based interventions typically include overtly spiritual content but also remain secular in their delivery. More recently, explicitly religion-themed mindfulness programs have emerged that are yet to be evaluated scientifically, raising questions as to how this to occur in the most appropriate manner. Referring to doctrinal charts in Won Buddhism, we illustrate an example of how the distinction can be made transparent between content that can be subjected to scientific inquiry and content related to religious and personal beliefs. By delineating elements of belief from practice, areas can be identified that are open for scientific verification without causing offense. Program participants and other practitioners can then clearly identify the specific aspects for which there is widely accepted evidence for their effectiveness, which may then also be communicated as science-based Buddhist practices.

TI  - Taming the Adolescent Mind: Preliminary report of a mindfulness-based psychological intervention for adolescents with clinical heterogeneous mental health diagnoses
T2  - CLINICAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based interventions such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MCBT) have been used to treat adults with psychiatric disorders. This article describes initial modification and development of a mindfulness-based intervention group program for adolescents with psychiatric disorders. It was hypothesized that the intervention would improve mindfulness, mental health outcomes and decrease psychological distress and symptoms.Method: Adolescents from a mental health clinic attended a 5-week group pilot mindfulness-based intervention. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires at pre- and post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Baseline measures indicated moderate to severe range of mental health symptoms.Results: After the intervention, adolescents reported significant decreases in psychological distress and increases in mindfulness and self-esteem. Qualitative data revealed the intervention to be engaging and beneficial. Parents also reported significant overall improvements of adolescents' functioning.Conclusions: These promising preliminary results suggest that the intervention was feasible, acceptable and offered positive impact on mental health problems, and the intervention warrants further research in a randomized controlled study.

TI  - The Role of Mindfulness-Based Therapies in Alleviating Anxiety and Depression among Chinese University Students
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Over the years, the prevalence of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety is rapidly increasing, emphasizing the incorporation of effective mindfulness-based therapies to overcome such issues. Therefore, this study also focuses on the role of mindfulness-based therapies in alleviating anxiety and depression among Chinese university students. Method: For this purpose, "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)" therapy was taken into account. A total of 100 students were considered for this study. 50 of the students were incorporated in MBSR group while the remaining were included in control group. In this regard, the "Affective Control Scale (ACS)" was used for determining the anger, depression, anxiety and positive emotion among both groups. Results: The results obtained from this RCT showed that the positive emotion fear was less than the fear concerning depression, anger and anxiety. The incorporated MBSR therapy was found to be effective in decreasing anxiety and depression among university students in China (p < 0.001). Conclusion: As a result, different cognitive mechanisms (rumination, decentering and mindfulness) are found to be improved among such students. The current study has also been effective in presenting different theoretical as well as practical implications in promoting mindfulness-based therapies to reduce anxiety and depression among individuals.

AB  - Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are often stressed due to the demands of the job, including the nature and severity of challenging behaviors of the clients, work conditions, degree of management support for the staff, and the demands of implementing some interventions under adverse conditions. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and PBS alone have been shown to be effective in assisting caregivers to better manage the challenging behaviors of clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The aim of the present study was to undertake a head-to-head assessment of the effectiveness of MBPBS and PBS alone in a 40-week randomized controlled trial. Of the 123 caregivers who met inclusion criteria, 60 were randomly assigned to MBPBS and 63 to PBS alone, with 59 completing the trial in the MBPBS condition and 57 in the PBS alone condition. Results showed both interventions to be effective, but the caregiver, client, and agency outcomes for MBPBS were uniformly superior to those of PBS alone condition. In addition, the MBPBS training was substantially more cost-effective than the PBS alone training. The present results add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of MBPBS and, if independently replicated, could provide an integrative health care approach in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities.

TI  - Effects of the Mindful Self-Compassion programme on clinical and health psychology trainees' well-being: A pilot study
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Clinical and health psychologists are often exposed to occupational hazards, such as burnout and compassion fatigue, which originate from emotional demands at work. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training has been demonstrated to be useful in increasing well-being and enhancing mental health. Although the use of the MSC programme in educational contexts has been suggested, an evaluation of its efficacy as a method to improve the competencies of trainees in clinical psychology has yet to be performed. Methods Our study used a sample of 61 adults (88.5% women) attending postgraduate courses in clinical and health psychology who participated in an 8-week MSC programme. Their levels of self-compassion, mindfulness, well-being, anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed before and after the intervention. Based on the participants' adherence to the MSC programme, two groups were created, that is, high (n = 30) versus low (n = 31) adherence. Results The participants in the high-adherence group benefitted from the MSC programme because they increased their self-compassion, mindfulness and psychological well-being scores. The extent to which the participants reported to have been committed to the MSC practice was associated with changes in self-compassion, mindfulness and psychological well-being. Furthermore, the changes in self-compassion were significantly correlated with changes in mindfulness and psychological well-being. Conclusion The MSC programme offers a promising way to develop professional competencies and enhance the well-being of trainees in clinical psychology.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion Training Online and Perceived Stress: Exploring Moderation of Awareness and Mediation of Acceptance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindful self-compassion (MSC) training is considered an effective method for reducing stress. This study aims to analyze whether MSC training influences perceived stress and investigates the roles of awareness and acceptance in the relationship between training and perceived stress as a moderator and a mediator, respectively. The research framework is based on the monitoring and acceptance theory and the emotion regulation theory. This study used a randomized controlled trial, where 25 voluntary participants from the alumni of the Ship for South-East Asian Youth Program in Myanmar were randomly assigned to a treatment or a waitlist control group. To examine the relationships, we used t-tests and moderated mediation analyses. The results showed that training had a positive effect on acceptance (t = -3.32, p = .00) and a negative effect on perceived stress (t = 3.57, p =.00), although it did not affect awareness significantly (t = .37, p = .77). It was also found that acceptance has a statistically significant full mediation on the relationship between training and perceived stress, with a negative indirect effect (a*b = -.26, Bootstrap CI95 = -.54 and -.02). Notably, awareness did not moderate the relationship between acceptance and perceived stress (b = -.31, t = -1.91, p > .05). The findings contribute to the literature from the perspectives of psychology and adult learning as it uses an experimental research design to investigate the underlying mechanism of the effect of MSC online training on perceived stress, critical in influencing a variety of behaviors.

TI  - Using Mindfulness-Based Interventions to Support Self-regulation in Young Children: A Review of the Literature
T2  - EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rise in stress, mental health concerns, and externalizing behaviors in children and their caregivers across the globe and illuminated the need to reduce stress levels and support self-regulation skills in even the youngest of children. The goal of this literature review is to describe what research has shown about the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to support young children's self-regulation in early childhood settings. A total of 18 research studies conducted between 2010 and 2021 were identified. The main purposes of the studies reviewed were to examine the effects of MBIs on the development of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive self-regulation. Results showed that teachers generally found mindfulness practices feasible, acceptable, and effective in their classrooms. Although MBIs were found to have mixed effects on self-regulation in young children, positive effects on self-regulation were significantly greater for children in need of additional support, including those with difficulties or delays in developing self-regulation skills. The current review found a wide variety of MBIs used in early childhood settings globally. The results of this review suggest that teaching mindfulness practices to young children and their caregivers can both support the development of self-regulation of young children and foster socially and emotionally healthy environments in which this development can occur.

TI  - Caring for others without losing yourself: An adaptation of the Mindful Self-Compassion Program for Healthcare Communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Two studies examined the efficacy of the Self-Compassion for Healthcare Communities (SCHC) program for enhancing wellbeing and reducing burnout among healthcare professionals. Method Study 1 (N = 58) had a quasi-experimental design and compared wellbeing outcomes for the SCHC group compared to a waitlist control group. Study 2 (N = 23) did not include a control group and examined the effect of SCHC on burnout. Results Study 1 found that SCHC significantly increased self-compassion and wellbeing. All gains were maintained for three months. Study 2 found that in addition to enhancing wellbeing, SCHC significantly reduced secondary traumatic stress and burnout. Changes in self-compassion explained gains in other outcomes, and initial levels of self-compassion moderated outcomes so that those initially low in self-compassion benefitted more. Conclusions Findings suggest that the SCHC program may be an effective way to increase self-compassion, enhance wellbeing, and reduce burnout for healthcare professionals.

TI  - Mindfulness interventions reduce blood pressure in patients with non-communicable diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are an emerging area of empirical study, not only in positive psychology, but also in clinical health care. This research aims to synthesize the evidence about whether MBIs reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs).Methods: Relevant studies were identified via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and the CINAHL database between 2009 and 2019. The papers selected focused on mindfulness and the effect of these on the BP of patients with NCDs. The change in SBP and DBP were meta-analyzed, stratified by type of intervention (Breathing awareness meditation (BAM), Mindfulness Meditation (MM), and Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR).Results: Fourteen articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Among the studies using the type and duration of intervention, systolic BP was reduced after the mindfulness-based stress reduction for 8 weeks (-6.90 mmHg [95% CI: -10.82, -2.97], p < .050), followed by the breathing awareness meditation for 12 weeks (-4.10 mmHg [95% CI: -7.54, -0.66], p < .050) and the mindfulness-based intervention for 8 weeks (-2.69 mmHg [95% CI: -3.90, -1.49], p < .050) whereas diastolic BP was reduced after the mindfulness-based stress reduction for 8 weeks (-2.45 mmHg [95% CI: -3.74, -1.17], p < .050) and the mindfulness-based intervention for 8 weeks (-2.24 mmHg [95% CI: -3.22, -1.26], p < .050).Conclusion: MBIs can provide effective alternative therapies to assist in blood pressure reduction for patients with NCDs.

TI  - 'Mindful eating' for reducing emotional eating in patients with overweight or obesity in primary care settings: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN EATING DISORDERS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe primary aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of a 'mindful eating' programme for reducing emotional eating in patients with overweight or obesity. MethodA cluster randomized controlled trial (reg. NCT03927534) was conducted with 76 participants with overweight/obesity who were assigned to 'mindful eating' (7 weeks) + treatment as usual (TAU), or to TAU alone. They were assessed at baseline, posttreatment and 12-month follow-up. The main outcome was 'emotional eating' (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, DEBQ); other eating behaviours were also assessed along with psychological and physiological variables. Results'Mindful eating' + TAU reduced emotional eating both at posttreatment (B = -0.27; p = 0.006; d = 0.35) and follow-up (B = -0.53; p d = 0.69) compared to the control group (TAU alone). 'External eating' (DEBQ) was also significantly improved by the intervention at both timepoints. Significant effects at follow-up were observed for some secondary outcomes related to bulimic behaviours, mindful eating, mindfulness, and self-compassion. Weight and other physiological parameters were not significantly affected by 'mindful eating' + TAU. ConclusionsThese findings support the efficacy of the 'mindful eating' + TAU programme for reducing emotional and external eating, along with some other secondary measures, but no significant changes in weight reduction were observed.

TI  - Mindfulness Interventions to Reduce Stress Among Nursing Personnel An Occupational Health Perspective
T2  - WORKPLACE HEALTH & SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Workplace stress within health care settings is rampant and predicted to increase in coming years. The profound effects of workplace stress on the health and safety of nursing personnel and the financial impact on organizations are well documented. Although organizational modification can reduce some sources of stress, several unique stress-producing factors inherent in the work of nursing personnel are immutable to such approaches. Mindfulness training, an evidence-based approach to increase situational awareness and positive responses to stressful situations, is an inexpensive strategy to reduce stress and improve the quality of nurses' work lives. Several approaches to training, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, can be tailored to health care settings. Considerations for occupational health nurses in incorporating mindfulness training as an aspect of a comprehensive work site health promotion program for nursing and other hospital personnel are discussed.

TI  - Mindfulness: A New Paradigm of Psychosocial Care in the Palliative Care Setting in Southeast Asia
T2  - ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Alleviation of suffering in palliative care needs a combination of good symptom control and psychosocial care. The capacity of mindfulness to promote psychological flexibility opens up possibilities of creating a paradigm shift that can potentially change the landscape of psychosocial care. In this review, we attempt to introduce 4 methods to establish mindfulness based on 'The Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness', a core text of Theravada Buddhism, followed by a brief comparison of the concepts and practices of mindfulness in different cultures and religions in SoutheastAsia. Next, 2 mindfulness-based interventions specifically designed for palliative psychosocial care mindfulness-based supportive therapy (MBST) and mini-mindfulness meditation (MMM) are introduced. We hypothesise that mindful practices, tailored to the palliative setting, can promote positive psychosocial outcomes.

TI  - Cognitive Behavior Therapy vs Mindfulness in Treatment of Prolonged Grief Disorder
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Although grief-focused cognitive behavior therapies are the most empirically supported treatment for prolonged grief disorder, many people find this treatment difficult. A viable alternative for treatment is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Objective To examine the relative efficacies of grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to reduce prolonged grief disorder severity. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA single-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial was conducted among adults aged 18 to 70 years with prolonged grief disorder, as defined in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, and assessed by clinical interview based on the Prolonged Grief-13 (PG-13) scale. Those with severe suicidal risk, presence of psychosis, or substance dependence were excluded. Between November 2012 and November 2022, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to eleven 90-minute sessions of grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy at a traumatic stress clinic in Sydney, Australia, with follow-up through 6 months. Interventions Both groups received once-weekly 90-minute individual sessions for 11 weeks. Grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy comprised 5 sessions of recalling memories of the deceased, plus cognitive restructuring and planning future social and positive activities. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy comprised mindfulness exercises adapted to tolerate grief-related distress. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in prolonged grief disorder severity measured by the PG-13 scale assessed at baseline, 1 week posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment (primary outcome time point), as well as secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, grief-related cognition, and quality of life. Results The trial included 100 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [13.4] years; 87 [87.0%] female), 50 in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy condition and 50 in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy condition. Linear mixed models indicated that at the 6-month assessment, participants in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy group showed greater reduction in PG-13 scale score relative to those in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group (mean difference, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.6-12.5; P = .01), with a large between-group effect size (0.8; 95% CI, 0.2-1.3). Participants in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy group also demonstrated greater reductions in depression as measured on the Beck Depression Inventory than those in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group (mean difference, 6.6; 95% CI, 0.5-12.9; P = .04) and grief-related cognition (mean difference, 14.4; 95% CI, 2.8-25.9; P = .02). There were no other significant differences between treatment groups and no reported adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy conferred more benefit for core prolonged grief disorder symptoms and associated problems 6 months after treatment than mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Although both treatments may be considered for prolonged grief disorder, grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy might be the more effective choice, taking all factors into consideration.

TI  - Using group-based interactive video teleconferencing to make self-compassion more accessible: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Many interventions designed to increase self-compassion are either (1) intense, group-based, and faceto-face delivered programs, such as Mindful Self-Compassion, or (2) less intense, self-administered interventions, such as self-compassionate writing or following guided meditations. This study explores if self-compassion can be increased in a novel intervention that is both intense and accessible using online group-based interactive video teleconferencing.Method: One-hundred-fifty-five healthy participants (130 women, 25 men) were randomized to a wait-list control group or to an intervention group that participated in two online workshops (via Zoom) and completed a self compassionate writing exercise. Participants filled out the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) before, directly after, and 1-week after the intervention. We assessed overall self-compassion, in addition to its six constituent sub factors: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. We analyzed all results using an intent-to-treat approach. In addition, participants' impressions and feasibility of the intervention were assessed.Results: Using linear mixed models, we found that the intervention increased total self-compassion as indicated by a significant interaction of Time and Treatment, F(2, 203.38) = 5.47, p = .005, with a small-to-medium effect, f = 0.22. Contrasts indicated significant differences between the intervention and the control group at the 1-week follow-up, but not directly after the intervention. We found similar effects for self-kindness, common humanity, and isolation. Qualitative answers indicated that participants liked the intervention and were pleased with the opportunity to interact with other participants.Conclusions: Self-compassion can be trained using interactive video teleconferencing interventions. The study highlights the potential benefits of group-based interventions as they allow for more interactions among participants, which in turn could reduce feelings of isolation. Finally, interactive video teleconferencing interventions have large unexplored potential for improving various resources that improve mental health or other facets of well-being other than self-compassion and this article gives recommendations for how to structure such interventions.

TI  - Enhancing academic resilience through mindfulness-based practices in the schools: A study on vocational high school students
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the positive correlation between mindfulness and resilience has gained visible importance. For this purpose, this study aims to increase the academic resilience and mindfulness level of vocational high school students with a low socioeconomic background, who often have lower resilience toward learning English as a foreign language (EFL) in Tu''rkiye. The study adopted an experimental research design. Before and after an eight-session mindfulness-based intervention, the Academic Resilience Scale and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent measured the levels of mindfulness awareness and academic resilience. The pretest and posttest results in control and experimental groups were analyzed in SPSS, and independent samples t-test and analysis covariance analysis were conducted for data analysis. Focus-group interviews explored possible attributions toward mindfulness awareness and academic resilience, using MAXQDA. The results revealed that there is a significant difference between the groups in terms of academic resilience, but there is no significant difference in the case of mindfulness. On the other hand, most students reported that their academic resilience increased, and they had positive attitudes toward mindfulness-based practices. However, it was observed that their classmates' distractive and biased behaviors in the classroom setting mostly resulted in a lapse in their mindfulness.Mindfulness-based practices could foster academic resilience in socioeconomically disadvantaged vocational high schools. Teachers should be encouraged to adopt mindfulness-based practices throughout the term, rather than beyond immediate interventions, to achieve lasting benefits. Mindfulness-based practices may resist change compared to academic resilience due to short program duration, inexperienced practitioners, teachers' multiple tasks, and students' difficulties in maintaining focus.

TI  - "I feel I can live every minute if I choose to": participants' experience of a positive mindfulness programme
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Both separately and together, mindfulness and positive psychological interventions have been found to increase wellbeing against a number of measures. Research has been primarily based on the application of self-report scales, and little has been done to examine the lived experience of participants. The aim of this study was to apply an interpretative phenomenological approach to the experience of participants in a Mindfulness Based Flourishing (MBF) programme, which combines positive psychological interventions with mindfulness in order to more fully understand the impact of their experience on them. Three participants from a completed MBF programme each had a one-off semi-structured interview, the results of which were transcribed verbatim. The resulting texts were analysed, with five themes emerging, which demonstrated the impact of the programme on participants' sense of self and on the nature of their connections with others. While all participants identified benefits accruing from the course, it also presented challenges emotionally as well as in terms of the embedding of knowledge and skills. Future research should look to examine the impact of such programmes in wider cultural and temporal frameworks and should explore the application of grounded theory to identify more theoretical level explanations of the phenomenon.

TI  - Evaluation of a specialized yoga program for persons with a spinal cord injury: a pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a specialized yoga program for individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) on pain, psychological, and mindfulness variables.Materials and methods: Participants with SCI (n=23) were outpatients or community members affiliated with a rehabilitation hospital. Participants were randomized to an Iyengar yoga (IY; n=11) group or to a 6-week wait-list control (WLC; n=12) group. The IY group participated in a twice-weekly 6-week seated IY program; the WLC group participated in the same yoga program, after the IY group's yoga program had ended. Pain, psychological, and mindfulness measures were collected at two time points for both groups (within 1-2 weeks before and after program 1 and at a third time point for the WLC group (within 1 week after program 2).Results: Linear mixed-effect growth models were conducted to evaluate the main effects of group at T2 (postintervention), controlling for T1 (preintervention) scores. T2 depression scores were lower(F-1,(18)=6.1, P<0.05) and T2 self-compassion scores higher (F-1,F-18=6.57, P<0.05) in the IY group compared to the WLC group. To increase sample size and power, the two groups were combined and analyzed across time by comparing pre- and postintervention scores. Main effects of time were found for depression scores, (F-1,F-14.83=6.62, P<0.05), self-compassion, (F-1,F-16.6=4.49, P<0.05), mindfulness (F-1,F-16.79=5.42, P<0.05), mindful observing (F-1,F-19.82=5.06, P<0.05), and mindful nonreactivity, (F-1,F-16.53=4.92, P<0.05), all showing improvement after the intervention.Discussion: The results indicated that a specialized 6-week yoga intervention reduced depressive symptoms and increased self-compassion in individuals with SCI, and may also have fostered greater mindfulness.

TI  - Changes in disengagement coping mediate changes in affect following mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in a non-clinical sample
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Past research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions increase positive affect in non-clinical populations. However, the mechanisms underlying this increase are poorly understood. On the basis of previous empirical and theoretical accounts, we hypothesized that a decreased use of disengagement coping strategies in daily life would explain the benefits of a mindfulness-based intervention in terms of increased positive affect. We analysed the data of 75 healthy adult participants (58 women; 17 men) of different ages (M=49years old; SD=13; age range 19-81) who had been randomly allocated to 8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waitlist control group. The results confirmed our hypothesis: Participants in the MBCT group showed significant improvements in positive affect compared to the control group, with decreased use of disengagement coping styles mediating these improvements. The implications of this study are discussed.

TI  - Review: Yoga and mindfulness for youth with autism spectrum disorder: review of the current evidence
T2  - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Yoga and mindfulness-based programs are becoming increasingly popular as a supplemental intervention for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Increasing numbers of children, parents, and schools are participating in programs around the country with an enthusiasm that far exceeds the research support for their efficacy. Therapies that are safe but not effective may not cause immediate harm. Nevertheless, the misappropriation of limited time and financial resources may result in missed opportunities. The need for clearly defined, evidence-based therapies for youth with ASD is essential. Method Electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed intervention research studies using the key words autistic or autism in combination with yoga, mindfulness, or meditation. Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Results The findings are described in this critical review of eight empirical research studies that implemented yoga and mindfulness-based interventions for children with ASD. Although few studies reported improvements in core symptoms of ASD, preliminary findings suggest that yoga and mindfulness-based interventions are feasible and may improve a variety of prosocial behaviors, including communication and imitative behaviors; increased tolerance of sitting and of adult proximity; self-control; quality of life; and social responsiveness, social communication, social cognition, preoccupations, and social motivation. Reductions in aggressive behaviors, irritability, lethargy, social withdrawal, and noncompliance were also reported. Conclusions Based on the available literature, the empirical evidence to support the efficacy of yoga and mindfulness-based interventions for children and adolescents with ASD is inconclusive. The current body of research has significant limitations, including small sample sizes, no fidelity measures, and no control groups. Each of the eight studies, however, reported some positive effects on social, emotional, or behavioral metrics. These early results are promising and sufficient to warrant support for further research.

TI  - Effect of an Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention on Postpandemic Era Nurses' Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological Adaptation
T2  - HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the effects of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on postpandemic era nurses' subjective well-being, job burnout, and psychological adaptation. Previous studies on the psychological adaptability of nurses mainly focused on investigation rather than intervention. Ninety nurses were randomly classified into an intervention or control group. The intervention group received weekly online mindfulness-based stress reduction training for 8 weeks. The Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological Use scales were administered pre- and postintervention. Postintervention, nurses' positive emotions and life satisfaction significantly improved. Nurses' psychological adaptation was significantly higher postintervention than preintervention. The total scores for negative emotion, low personal accomplishment, and job burnout were significantly lower postintervention than preintervention. The scores for positive emotion and life satisfaction in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the scores for low personal accomplishment in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Online mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions can improve nurses' subjective well-being, reduce job burnout, and improve their level of psychological adaptability. Moreover, it could promote nurses' ability to communicate mindfully with patients and their families. This intervention could help promote the development of mindfulness in the nursing field.

TI  - Psychological Treatments in Adult ADHD: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and or impulsivity. First line treatment is medication; however, medication alone may not provide sufficient functional improvement for some patients, or be universally tolerated. A recent surge in research to treat ADHD using non-pharmacological interventions demands a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence base for psychological treatments for ADHD management in adulthood. A systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, PubMed, and EMBASE was undertaken until January 2019 for peer-reviewed articles exploring psychological interventions for adults (18 years with no upper limit) diagnosed with ADHD. A total of 53 papers were identified for inclusion. Collectively, 92% of studies (employing various non-pharmacological interventions) found a variant of significant positive effect on either primary or secondary outcomes associated with ADHD. The strongest empirical support derived from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions. In addition, findings indicated support for the effectiveness of Mindfulness, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Neurofeedback. Other types of interventions also demonstrated effectiveness; however, support was limited due to lack of available research and methodological rigor. Psychological interventions should be considered a valid and useful addition to clinical practice. Implications and areas for future research are discussed.

TI  - Mindful Yoga Intervention as Add-on to Treatment as Usual for Young Women With Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine the added value of a 9-week mindful yoga intervention (MYI) as add-on to treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing depression for young women (18-34 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 171) comparing TAU + MYI with TAU-only. Assessments were at baseline, postintervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures were clinician-rated and self-reported symptoms of depression, together with a diagnostic interview to establish MDD diagnosis that was restricted to the baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments. Quality of life in various domains was assessed as secondary outcome measure. As potential mediators for treatment efficacy, we included self-report measures of rumination, self-criticism, self-compassion, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived body awareness and dispositional mindfulness, together with behavioral measures of attentional bias (AB) and depression-related self-associations. Results: Adding MYI to TAU did not lead to greater reduction of depression symptoms, lower rate of MDD diagnosis or increase in quality of life in various domains of functioning at post and follow-up assessments. There were no indirect effects through any of the potential mediators, with the exception of self-compassion. Conclusion: Adding MYI to TAU appeared not more efficacious than TAU-only in reducing depression symptoms in young women.

TI  - Evaluating the feasibility and preliminary effects of an online compassion training program for nursing students: A pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of an online compassion training program for nursing students and preliminarily investigate its effects on mindfulness, self-compassion, and stress reduction. Methods: This study employed a randomized controlled trial design. Second-year students from a nursing college in Guangzhou, China, were recruited as research participants in August 2023. The intervention group participated in an 8-week online compassion training program via the WeChat platform, comprising three stages: mindfulness (weeks 1-2), self-compassion (weeks 3-5), and compassion for others (weeks 6 -8). Each stage included four activities: psychoeducation, mindfulness practice, weekly diary, and emotional support. Program feasibility was assessed through recruitment and retention rates, program engagement, and participant acceptability. Program effectiveness was measured with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Self-Compassion Scale - Short Form, and Perceived Stress Scale. Results: A total of 28 students completed the study (13 in the intervention group, 15 in the control group). The recruitment rate was 36.46%, with a high retention rate of 93.3%. Participants demonstrated high engagement: 69.2% accessed learning materials every 1-2 days, 93.3% practiced mindfulness at least weekly, with an average of 4.69 diary entries submitted per person and 23.30 WeChat interactions with instructors. Regarding acceptability, all participants expressed satisfaction with the program, with 92.4% finding it "very helpful" or "extremely helpful." In terms of intervention effects, the intervention group showed a significant increase in mindfulness levels from pre-intervention (51.54 +/- 10.93) to postintervention (62.46 +/- 13.58) (P < 0.05), while no significant change was observed in the control group. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in post-intervention self-compassion and perceived stress levels, the intervention group showed positive trends: selfcompassion levels increased (35.85 +/- 8.60 vs. 40.85 +/- 5.54), and perceived stress levels slightly decreased (44.77 +/- 8.65 vs. 42.00 +/- 5.77). Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of an online compassion training program for nursing students and suggested its potential effectiveness in enhancing mindfulness, self-compassion, and stress reduction. Despite limitations such as small sample size and lack of long-term follow-up, preliminary evidence indicates promising prospects for integrating such training into nursing education. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and assess the sustained impact of this approach on nursing education and practice.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as supportive therapy in cancer care: systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims: This paper reports a systematic review and critical appraisal of the evidence on the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for cancer supportive care.Background: The experience of cancer can have a negative impact on both psychological and physical health and on quality of life. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is a therapy package that has been used with patients with a variety of conditions. In order to draw conclusions on its effectiveness for cancer patients, the evidence requires systematic assessment.Methods: A comprehensive search of major biomedical and specialist complementary medicine databases was conducted. Additionally, efforts were made to identify unpublished and ongoing research. Relevant research was categorized by study type and appraised according to study design. Clinical commentaries were obtained for each study and included in the review.Results: Three randomized controlled clinical trials and seven uncontrolled clinical trials were found. A lack of relevant qualitative research studies was identified. Studies report positive results, including improvements in mood, sleep quality and reductions in stress. A dose-response effect has been observed between practice of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and improved outcome. A number of methodological limitations were identified. Modifications to the traditional Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programme make comparison between studies difficult and a lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusion on efficacy.Conclusion: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction has potential as a clinically valuable self-administered intervention for cancer patients. Further research into its efficacy, feasibility and safety for cancer patients in the nursing context is recommended.

TI  - Parental Stress Related to Caring for a Child With Autism Spectrum Disorder and the Benefit of Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Parental Stress: A Systematic Review
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to exhibit more severe challenging behaviors than typically developing children and those with intellectual or other disabilities. This study aimed to review the stress levels of parents of individuals with ASD, and the use of mindfulness to decrease parental stress. The following variables of Autism, Stress, Parenting, Family, and Mindfulness were searched in PubMed and APA PsycNet databases. The studies between 2000 and 2023 with at least two of the mentioned keywords were included for further review. This review highlights the significance of further research on the severity of autism symptoms and how they are related to the level of parental stress, and it thoroughly examines the findings of pertinent studies on parental stress and autism. Furthermore, it aims to draw attention to the application of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing parental stress. Parents of children with ASD were found to have higher stress levels than those of typically developing children. Mindfulness-based interventions were found to be helpful in decreasing parents' stress levels. Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder is very challenging, which causes parents to experience higher stress levels than those of typically developing children.Parental stress in connection with the severity of ASD symptoms and the use of mindfulness for parental stress.The current systematic review aimed to analyze the relationship between parental stress and severity of ASD symptoms by reviewing the outcomes of previous research studies. There seems to be a positive relationship between parental stress and ASD symptom severity, as reported by most of the reviewed studies. The effect of mindfulness-based interventions to relieve parental stress was also reviewed. The results revealed a positive effect of mindfulness-based interventions in decreasing the parents' stress levels.

TI  - A Comparison of Formal and Informal Mindfulness Programs for Stress Reduction in University Students
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Undergraduate and graduate students show elevated levels of stress and could thus benefit from mindfulness interventions, but the best way to teach mindfulness has not been established. The present study compared a stress management program that used formal meditations and informal practice (Mindful Stress Management; MSM) to one that used brief mindfulness exercises and informal practice (Mindful Stress Management-Informal; MSM-I), and a wait-list control. MSM participants exhibited significant within-group changes on all measures, and when compared to the wait-list control, greater levels of mindfulness, decentering, and self-compassion, as well as lower stress. Students in MSM-I had significant within-group changes on a subset of measures, and greater mindfulness and self-compassion compared to the wait-list. MSM participants showed more improvement in self-compassion, psychological inflexibility, and stress than did those in MSM-I. Mediational analyses found increases in one facet of mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreases in worry mediated reductions in stress for MSM participants, while no mediator reached significance for MSM-I. Finally, no significant relation between amount of formal meditation and informal practice and reductions in psychological distress or increases in mindfulness was found. Results suggest that a program with formal meditations and informal practice may be a more promising intervention for university student stress than one with brief mindfulness exercises and informal practice.

TI  - Using Mindfulness to Improve Quality of Life in Caregivers of Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorder: Agency Outcomes for Caregivers and Clients
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectivesResearch suggests that the quality of life of professional caregivers of individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder can be enhanced through mindfulness-based training. The effects of such training have been evidenced in terms of perceived psychological stress, compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue (i.e., burnout, secondary traumatic stress), and symptoms of depression. In addition to changes in caregiver personal outcomes, mindfulness-based training may have effects on the quality assurance variables of the agency that employs these caregivers. The aim of the present study was to examine the changes from a systems perspective in terms of quality assurance variables related to caregivers and clients in community-based group homes.MethodsProfessional caregivers (n = 216) were randomized into three experimental conditions based on the training they received: mindfulness, psychoeducation, or inservice training-as-usual (control). The effects of the training were assessed in terms of quality assurance indices pertaining to caregivers (progressive discipline, call-ins, days absent, medical referrals, hospitalizations, and caregiver turnover) and clients (learning objectives, behavioral episodes, use of physical restraints, emergency medications [stat], medical emergencies, hospitalizations, aggression to staff, aggression to peers, and level of supervision).ResultsOverall, caregivers in the mindfulness group exhibited significantly fewer progressive discipline and call-ins when compared to the psychoeducation and control groups. Caregivers in both the mindfulness and psychoeducation groups exhibited significantly fewer days of absence from work, medical referrals, and caregiver turnover when compared to the control group. There was no difference across the three groups in terms of hospitalizations. Clients under the care of mindfulness-trained caregivers showed significantly greater improvement in completing learning objectives, fewer behavioral episodes, reduced need for physical restraints and stat medication for behavioral episodes, fewer episodes of aggression to peers, and lower levels of supervision when compared to those in the psychoeducation and control groups. Clients did equally well in terms of medical emergencies, hospitalizations, and aggression to staff in the mindfulness and psychoeducation groups when compared to those in the control group.ConclusionsDifferential effects of mindfulness training, psychoeducation, and inservice training-as-usual were evident in quality assurance variables related to caregivers and clients. The results suggest that training caregivers in different approaches to self-care may differentially affect not only their clinical status but also at a systems level in terms of quality assurance indices.

TI  - Home practice in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of participants' mindfulness practice and its association with outcomes
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) emphasize the importance of mindfulness practice at home as an integral part of the program. However, the extent to which participants complete their assigned practice is not yet clear, nor is it clear whether this practice is associated with positive outcomes.For this systematic review and meta-analysis, searches were performed using Scopus and PubMed for studies published through to the end of 2015, reporting on formal home practice of mindfulness by MBSR or MBCT participants.Across 43 studies (N = 1427), the pooled estimate for participants' home practice was 64% of the assigned amount, equating to about 30 minutes per day, six days per week [95% CI 60-69%]. There was substantial heterogeneity associated with this estimate. Across 28 studies (N = 898), there was a small but significant association between participants' self-reported home practice and intervention outcomes (r = 0.26, 95% CI 0.19,-0.34).MBSR and MBCT participants report completing substantial formal mindfulness practice at home over the eight-week intervention, albeit less than assigned amounts. There is a small but significant association between the extent of formal practice and positive intervention outcomes for a wide range of participants. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Teaching Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Self-Compassion (TADS) to Reduce Diabetes Distress: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adolescents living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience diabetes distress (DD), a construct distinct from depression or anxiety that refers to the negative emotions that arise from living with and managing diabetes. Self-compassion, which involves being open to one's own suffering and treating oneself with the same care one would show to loved ones, is associated with better psychological and clinical outcomes among individuals with T1D. Self-compassion is a skill that can be taught and therefore represents an opportunity for intervention.Objective: The overall aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a web-based mindful self-compassion for teens (MSC-T) intervention on improving DD, anxiety, depression, diabetes-related disordered eating, and suicidal ideation experienced by youth with T1D (aged between 12 and 17 years) compared with a waitlist control group (standard of care). We will also explore (1) if the effect of the MSC-T intervention changes over time, (2) if the MSC-T intervention has a positive impact on measures of glycemic control, and (3) if the effect of the MSC-T intervention differs based on self-reported gender.Methods: We will conduct a single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial of 140 adolescents with T1D followed for 12 months. Participants will be randomly allocated (using hidden allocation) in a 1:1 ratio to either the MSC-T intervention or the waitlist control group. Our primary outcome is DD, as measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes-Teen (PAID-T) version at 3 months. Secondary outcomes, assessed at 3 and 12 months, include anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), diabetes-related disordered eating (Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised [DEPS-R] version), and suicidal ideation (using 1 question from the PHQ-9). Results: Study recruitment began in October 2022 and was completed in March 2023, with a total of 141 participants enrolling. Data collection will be ongoing until March 2024. The first results are expected in June 2024. Conclusions: This study will be the first randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of the web-based MSC-T intervention on adolescents with T1D. Given that adolescence is a period where individuals are typically required to assume more responsibility for their diabetes care, providing adolescents with the tools they need to better manage the stress that often accompanies T1D management is paramount.

TI  - Effects of Training Staff in MBPBS on the Use of Physical Restraints, Staff Stress and Turnover, Staff and Peer Injuries, and Cost Effectiveness in Developmental Disabilities
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Some individuals with developmental disabilities who reside in community group homes occasionally engage in low-frequency, but high-intensity, aggressive behavior. Over time, staff members assigned to manage the aggressive behaviors of these individuals are repeatedly injured, have to take time off work, become highly stressed, and eventually find alternative employment. In this study, we provided a 7-day intensive Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) training to staff from three group homes and measured the effects of such training on their use of verbal redirection and physical restraint, staff stress levels and turnover, staff and peer injuries, and benefit-cost analyses. When compared to baseline measures, results showed clinically and statistically significant reductions in the use of verbal redirection, complete disuse of physical restraints within a few weeks of MBPBS training, and cessation of staff and peer injuries. In addition, there was a significant reduction in staff stress and zero staff turnover. Finally, benefit-cost analysis showed substantial financial savings due to staff participation in the MBPBS program. This study adds to the extant research suggestive of mindfulness-based interventions being effective in reducing the use of restraints, decreasing staff stress, and providing financial savings to the service providers of individuals with developmental disabilities.

TI  - Mindfulness Integrative Model (MIM): Cultivating positive states of mind towards oneself and the others through mindfulness and self-compassion
T2  - ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - There are more and more studies showing the effectiveness of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in well-being. However, there are few studies that explore the mechanisms underlying this effect. The aim of this study is to present and validate the Integrative Model of Mindfulness (MIM). MINI main hypothesis is that mindfulness practice leads to an increment in mindfulness trait, which leads to an increase of self compassion, and these in turn, lead to increase positive mental states towards others and oneself. A MBI intensive three-week with non-randomized controlled group was designed. Participants (N = 87) were differentiated by meditation experience as well. The results show large effect sizes regarding the effect of MBI on mindfulness trait, self-compassion and positive mental states to oneself and to others. The data support the MIM, indicating that the practice of mindfulness meditation leads in a sequentially way to the cultivation of mindfulness and self-compassion, which subsequently appears to lead to the development of positive mental states towards others and oneself.

TI  - Extending the Transformative Potential of Mindfulness Through Team Mindfulness Training, Integrating Individual With Collective Mindfulness, in a High-Stress Military Setting
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness has come to be considered an important approach to help individuals cultivate transformative capacity to free themselves from stress and suffering. However, the transformative potential of mindfulness extends beyond individual stress management. This study contributes to a broadening of the scope of contemplative science by integrating the prominent, individually focused mindfulness meditation literature with collective mindfulness scholarship. In so doing, it aims to illuminate an important context in which mindfulness interventions are increasingly prevalent: workplaces. Typically, the intended effect of workplace mindfulness training is to help workers manage stress better. Since mindfulness in organizations impacts individual and collective processes, the study blends the above literatures to create a cross-level "next-generation" Team Mindfulness Training (TMT) pilot. Its potential in helping individuals and teams to manage work stress better is investigated via a two-phase mixed-methods research study in high-stress military work populations, and compared to a conventional ("first-generation") 8-week mindfulness meditation program based on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Results suggest that compared to the "first-generation" mindfulness program, TMT seems no less effective in raising individual stress management skills, and may hold more promise in generating collective capacity to manage stress and unexpected difficulty, linked to an apparent interdependence between collective and individual mindfulness capacity development. Based on these empirical results, the study contributes to theory in three important ways: first, it outlines how individual and collective mindfulness in workplaces may be interdependent. Second, it explains why "next-generation" workplace training interventions should apply a cross-level approach. And third, it illustrates how its transformative potential for people at work, individually as well as collectively, can be extended by moving beyond an inward-looking meditation focus in mindfulness training. The study contributes to practice by providing a detailed outline of the pilot TMT program, and offers a series of follow-up research opportunities to inspire further scientific innovation in workplace mindfulness training, especially for high-stress work populations. The study's ultimate aim is to prompt a shift away from adapting clinically oriented, self-focused "first-generation" mindfulness training protocols, and towards mindfulness as team sport: a more prosocially oriented mindfulness science intent on generating wisdom and compassion, for one and all.

TI  - Mindfulness-based psychosocial interventions and psychological wellbeing in cancer survivorship: a meta-analysis
T2  - HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose: Among cancer survivors, mindfulness-based interventions appear promising in decreasing distress for cancer patients, but little attention has been paid to the ultimate mindfulness goal of increasing psychological wellbeing. This meta-analysis aims to summarise and synthesise available evidence concerning the effectiveness of MBIs on positive psychological outcomes reflecting key aspects of psychological wellbeing in heterogeneous cancer patients. Methods: A literature search of mindfulness-based randomised clinical trials in cancer survivors was conducted across six electronic databases. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Meta-analyses were conducted using R; standardised mean difference (SMD) was used to determine intervention effect. Moderators examined included therapeutic orientation, control group type, treatment modality, treatment target, heterogeneous vs. homogeneous cancer type, and facet of wellbeing. Results: Thirty-one studies were included (N = 2651). Those who received mindfulness-based interventions reported significantly higher eudaimonic, hedonic, and social wellbeing than respondents in control groups (SMD = 0.599). Interventions were equally effective across therapeutic orientation, control group type, treatment modality and treatment target. There were trend level differences favouring homogeneous cancer diagnosis groups over heterogeneous diagnosis groups. Conclusion: MBIs provide an effective treatment for increasing psychological wellbeing in cancer survivors. This finding has important implications for clinical practice.

TI  - Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification in Mild-to-Moderate Depression: Outcomes and Moderation Effects of Spirituality
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Understanding the relevance of religion or spirituality (R/S) in the treatment of mental disorders is central to clinical and academic psychiatry. In this secondary analysis, associations of R/S with depression were investigated with respect to a new second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, the Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program.Methods: Different aspects of spirituality, spiritual coping, and spiritual engagement were assessed in 81 patients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate depression. Treatment effects on R/S postscores and predictor and moderation effects of depression severity and stress change-scores were evaluated at 8 weeks (MBLM vs. CONTROL [drug continuation therapy] vs. TAU [inpatient treatment as usual]) and 6 months (TAU+MBLM vs. TAU).Results: At both time points, significant differences between MBLM versus TAU and CONTROL were found in a range of spiritual outcomes, most of them with a medium-to-large effect size and in favor of MBLM. Baseline interest in spirituality (p = 0.001) and baseline spiritual mind-body practice (p = 0.017) were identified as independent predictors of change in depression severity at 6 months. Moreover, moderation analyses found that patients reporting often/regular spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months did not benefit differently from TAU+MBLM versus TAU (p = 0.437) regarding their change in depression severity and stress, while those reporting no/seldom spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months benefited significantly worse from TAU than from TAU+MBLM (p = 0.002).Conclusions: Participation in the MBLM program resulted in significantly greater increases in spirituality in depressed patients than standard therapy. Interest in spirituality and engagement in spiritual mind-body practices at baseline were positive predictors of clinical outcome in both groups. Patients of any group who regularly performed spiritual mind-body practices benefited equally in terms of antidepressant outcomes, underlining the benefit of these practices within a general therapeutic framework.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03652220

TI  - Integrative Review of the Relationship Between Mindfulness-Based Parenting Interventions and Depression Symptoms in Parents
T2  - JOGNN-JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGIC AND NEONATAL NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: To synthesize the research findings about the relationship between mindfulness-based parenting interventions and symptoms of depression in parents.Data Sources: The terms mindfulness, parent or mother, and depression were used to search PubMed, the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and PsychInfo/OVID databases. A limitation was not set for date of publication.Study Selection: The database searches resulted in 198 articles for abstract review, 7 of which remained after the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three randomized controlled trials and four descriptive studies were included in the review. Three studies included mothers as the only participants; the other studies included a small to moderate percentage of fathers.Data Extraction: Studies were reviewed for findings relevant to the relationship between mindfulness-based parenting interventions and symptoms of depression in parents according to their respective research designs.Data Synthesis: Analysis of the randomized controlled trials showed that mindfulness-based parenting interventions had significant positive treatment effects on symptoms of depression. Analysis of the descriptive studies showed significant inverse associations between mindfulness and depression scores. Although findings were consistent across the studies, the studies varied significantly in participant characteristics, intervention frequency and duration, and measurement tools.Conclusion: Further research is recommended with regard to the use of mindfulness-based parenting interventions to influence symptoms of depression in diverse populations. Samples of parents with culturally, economically, or racially diverse backgrounds have not been well-studied in relation to mindfulness-based parenting. Consistent use of frameworks, intervention types, and measurement tools across studies will strengthen the body of evidence.

AB  - Due to the multi-factorial nature of the self-report of happiness, an enhancement program was designed that focused on mental style (subjective processes), and relationships, work, money, health, and leisure (objective life domains). An examination of interventions revealed mindfulness training (subjective factors) and goal setting (objective factors) as effective change modalities. To address this, the Mindfulness-based Quality of Life and Well-being Program (MQW) was developed and evaluated against the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, Quality of Life Index, Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, the Satisfaction with Life scale, and the newly developed Clinical Quality of Life Scale (CLINQOL). To explore training protocol effects, the program was delivered in a graduated (6 weekly sessions x 2 hours) and intensive (2 consecutive days x 6 hours) format. Using a randomized trial, participants were allocated across these conditions and a control. A total of 191 participants completed the study and were assessed at pre, post and follow up time points. Increases in mindfulness, quality of life, subjective well-being, and positive and negative affect (not life satisfaction), were greater in treated (combined formats) than control participants at post-test, and for mindfulness at follow up. Other than an increase in mindfulness for the 2 day condition at follow up, changes were similar in both intervention formats. Finally, to investigate what unique difference the MQW might have in comparison to teaching just mindfulness, the full version of the program was compared to an expanded section of the mindfulness component of the program. A total of 74 subjects began the program and filled out assessments across the three time periods. There was no difference between groups or an interaction between group and time. Overall, the findings provide preliminary evidence that a multi-dimensional training approach, using mindfulness and goal setting, may be a beneficial intervention model to enhance subjective and objective components in the perception of quality of life and well-being. However, further investigation into its added benefit to mindfulness alone is required.

TI  - Efficacy and acceptability of a pilot dietary intervention focusing on self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Overweight and obesity are universal health challenges. Recent evidence emphasises the potential benefits of addressing psychological factors associated with obesity in dietary programmes. This pilot study investigated the efficacy and acceptability of a combined online and face-to-face dietary intervention that used self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring to improve dietary behaviour, as well as psychological factors associated with dietary behaviour. Design: Embedded mixed methods including a 4-week before-after trial and a one-on-one interview. Quantitative outcomes of the study were the levels of self-compassion; eating pathology; depression, anxiety and stress; and dietary intake. Qualitative outcomes were participants' perceptions about the acceptability of the intervention. Setting: UNSW Kensington campus. Participants: Fourteen participants with overweight and obesity aged between 18 and 55 years old. Results: Results showed that the intervention significantly improved self-compassion and some aspects of dietary intake (e.g. decrease in energy intake) at Week Four compared with Week Zero. Some aspects of eating pathology also significantly decreased (e.g. Eating Concern). However, changes in self-compassion over the 4 weeks did not significantly predict Week Four study outcomes, except for level of stress. Most participants found self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring to be essential for dietary behaviour change. However, participants also indicated that an online programme needed to be efficient, simple and interactive. Conclusions: In conclusion, the current study provides preliminary but promising findings of an effective and acceptable combined online and face-to-face intervention that used self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring to improve dietary habits. However, the results need to be examined in future long-term randomised controlled trials.

TI  - A mindful self-compassion videoconference intervention for nationally recruited posttreatment young adult cancer survivors: feasibility, acceptability, and psychosocial outcomes
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Young adult (YA) cancer survivors report substantial distress, social isolation, and body image concerns that can impede successful reintegration into life years after treatment completion. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) interventions focus on developing mindfulness and self-compassion for managing distress, hardships, and perceived personal inadequacies. An MSC intervention would be beneficial in supporting YA survivors' management of psychosocial challenges that arise in survivorship; however, a telehealth intervention modality is essential for reaching this geographically dispersed population. We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of an MSC 8-week videoconference intervention for nationally recruited YA survivors (ages 18-29).The MSC intervention was group-based, 90-minute videoconference sessions, held weekly over 8 weeks, with audio-supplemented home practice. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed via attendance rate and an intervention satisfaction scale. Baseline to post-intervention changes in psychosocial outcomes (body image, anxiety, depression, social isolation, posttraumatic growth, resilience, self-compassion, mindfulness) were assessed using paired t tests and Cohen's d effect sizes.Thirty-four participants were consented and 25 attended a videoconference group. Feasibility was established with 84% attending at least six of the eight sessions, and intervention acceptability was high (M = 4.36, SD = 0.40, score range = 1-5). All psychosocial outcomes, except for resilience, demonstrated significant changes (p < 0.002), with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.5).YA survivors are interested in receiving an MSC videoconference intervention. Feasibility, acceptance, and potential psychosocial benefits of the intervention were demonstrated. Findings can be applied toward the design of an efficacy randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life for YA survivors in transition after cancer treatment.

TI  - Can mindfulness-based interventions reduce PTSD symptoms? An umbrella review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating, often chronic condition with substantial cross-national lifetime prevalence. Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may help reduce PTSD symptoms, efficacy results are inconsistent. Despite many systematic reviews (SRs) examining MBIs for PTSD, SR quality has been neither evaluated nor synthesized. We conducted an umbrella review to summarize and evaluate existing evidence regarding MBIs for PTSD, identifying 69 SRs (27 meta-analyses), consisting of 83 primary studies. Using AMSTAR2 (a valid SR quality assessment tool), we evaluated each SR on key domains relevant to methodological rigor and rated the confidence of inferences. Results found SRs were 65.2% non-rigorous, 27.5% likely rigorous, and 7.2% rigorous; common limitations included inadequate risk of bias assessment, extractions not completed in duplicate, and lack of pre-registration, highlighting the need for higher quality SRs. We then performed a meta-meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of MBIs to reduce PTSD symptoms, yielding a medium effect size (SMD=0.41, p < .001), derived from 22 meta-analyses (with replicable data) and 35 unique articles. Analyses were consistent across control conditions and MBI type (first-generation/narrow [i.e., MBIs with well-established protocols]) versus broad (i.e., other MBI types), comparable with second-line treatments (e.g., pharmacotherapy). Findings were narratively synthesized; areas for methodological improvements in MBI research were identified.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based intervention on quality of life and poststroke depression in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a devastating disease that can lead to poststroke depression (PSD) and greatest impact on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Mindfulness meditation was viewed as one of the effective ways to reduce PSD in patients with cancer. The present study tried to investigate whether mindfulness meditation has potential benefits in PSD and QOL for sICH patients in China.Methods Two hundred and two patients in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, enrolled from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in a randomized controlled trial. After removing missing values, there were 67 in control group and 67 in intervention group. Patients in intervention group received 2-month mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and patients in control group received stress management education (ie, an active control).Results The results suggested that the significant differences of depression, trait mindfulness, social well-being, emotional well-being, and total score of QOL were found in intervention group from time 1 to time 2. Physical well-being and the score of NIH stroke scale experienced significant changes in both control group and intervention group over time.Conclusions Mindfulness-based intervention has positive effects on sICH patients' depression, social well-being, and emotional well-being. However, the change of trait mindfulness over time could not explain these positive effects. Future studies could explore the mechanism of mindfulness-based intervention on sICH patients' depression and QOL and clarify the boundaries of the positive effects of mindfulness-based intervention.

T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research was conducted to prepare a mindfulness-based psychoeducation program for adolescents and to test the effect of the program on character strengths, mindfulness levels, and academic achievement of high school students. The study was designed as mixed-method research, and consisted of two stages. In the first stage, the relationship between mindfulness, character strengths, and academic achievement was investigated. According to the findings, 24.5% of the variance in grade point average was predicted by mindfulness and three character strengths including persistence, prudence, and openness to learning. In the second stage, a mindfulness-based psychoeducation program was developed and its effects on high school students' perseverance, prudence, love of learning character strengths, mindfulness, and academic achievements were examined in a pretest- posttest randomized control group design. According to results, the 8-week mindfulness-based psychoeducation program increased the level of mindfulness of participants, while partially increasing their three character strengths, and academic achievement.

TI  - A structured literature review on the role of mindfulness, mindful eating and intuitive eating in changing eating behaviours: effectiveness and associated potential mechanisms
T2  - NUTRITION RESEARCH REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The role of mindfulness, mindful eating and a newer concept of intuitive eating in modulating eating habits is an area of increasing interest. In this structured literature review, a summary of the current evidence is presented, together with details of interventions undertaken and the tools to measure outcomes. It is broad in scope given the emerging evidence base in this area. The review yielded sixty-eight publications: twenty-three interventions in obese/overweight populations; twenty-nine interventions in normal-weight populations; sixteen observational studies, three of which were carried out in overweight/obese populations. Mindfulness-based approaches appear most effective in addressing binge eating, emotional eating and eating in response to external cues. There is a lack of compelling evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness and mindful eating in weight management. Mindfulness-based approaches may prevent weight gain. Reduced food intake was seen in some of the studies in overweight and obese populations, but this was less apparent in the studies in normal-weight populations. The evidence base for intuitive eating is limited to date and further research is needed to examine its potential in altering eating behaviours. Mindfulness appears to work by an increased awareness of internal, rather than external, cues to eat. Mindfulness and mindful eating have the potential to address problematic eating behaviours and the challenges many face with controlling their food intake. Encouraging a mindful eating approach would seem to be a positive message to be included in general weight management advice to the public.

TI  - Intervention for the Management of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms to Reduce Caregiver Stress: Protocol for the Mindful and Self-Compassion Care Intervention for Caregivers of Persons Living With Dementia.
T2  - JMIR research protocols
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress related to Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) is common, particularly among those who care for persons with challenging behaviors and personality or mood changes. Mindfulness and self-compassion programs are efficacious for managing stress. The skills of mindfulness and self-compassion, however, must be integrated with behavioral management skills in order to effectively improve caregiver stress.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to describe the development of the Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care (MASC) program, the first program that combines mindfulness and self-compassion with behavioral management skills to decrease caregiver stress, and its evaluation in the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD Learning (SOCIAL) study.METHODS: Using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stage model, we describe 3 phases of work encompassing NIH Stages 1A and 1B. In phase 1, we conducted 5 focus groups (N=28) of stressed individuals caring for persons with ADRD and challenging behaviors. Rapid data analysis informed the development of a 6-week online intervention. Phase 2 (NIH stage 1A) includes an open pilot (N>10) with optional exit interviews. Phase 3 (NIH stage 1B) is a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the intervention versus the Health Education Program control. Primary outcomes focus on feasibility with secondary outcomes encompassing acceptability, credibility, fidelity, and signals of preliminary efficacy. Phase 1 follows traditional recommendations for qualitative analyses (at the point of thematic saturation) which was achieved after 5 focus groups (N=28). For the phase 2 open pilot, up to 12 participants will be recruited. For the phase 3 feasibility study, recruitment of 80 caregivers will allow the assessment of feasibility benchmarks. Data for phase 1 included 5 focus groups. In phases 2 and 3, data collection will occur through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) surveys and an optional qualitative exit interview. Analyses will include hybrid inductive-deductive analyses for qualitative data and assessment of changes in our intervention targets and outcomes using t tests and correlation analyses.RESULTS: In phase 1, caregivers reported interest in a brief, online stress management program. Participants held misconceptions about mindfulness and self-compassion, but after detailed explanation thoughts, these skills could be helpful when directly linked to implementation during caregiving routines. Phases 2 and 3 will be completed by the end of 2025.CONCLUSIONS: We describe the protocol for the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD Learning study, as well as the development and feasibility testing of the Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care intervention. Future work will include a fully powered efficacy-effectiveness randomized controlled trial.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials NCT05847153; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05847153; and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06276023; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06276023.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/58356.

TI  - From inner to dyadic connection: the role of mindfulness in mother-infant interaction during the first year of life
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Mother-infant attunement is fundamental to supporting infant socio-emotional development. Based on the assumption that we connect better with others if we are aware of and connected with our own experience, mindfulness could affect the maternal ability to attune to the infant. However, little is known about this topic in the first year of life. Study 1 aimed to investigate the role of maternal dispositional mindfulness and mindful parenting in mother-infant physiological and behavioral attunement at 3 months of age. Study 2 aimed to explore the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention not specific to parenting experience on mother-infant behavioral and physiological attunement and on maternal wellbeing at 9 months of age.Methods In Study 1, mother-infant (n = 67) behavioral and physiological attunement (i.e., co-regulation and RSA) were collected simultaneously each 20 s during face-to-face interaction. Mothers completed questionnaires about their dispositional mindfulness and mindful parenting. In Study 2, mother-infant dyads were randomly divided into a control (n = 20) and an intervention group (n = 29). The intervention group attended a 5-week mindfulness-based intervention. At T1 and T2, the same procedure described in Study 1 was applied and mothers reported about their wellbeing.Results Results showed that maternal mindfulness was associated with high physiological and behavioral attunement at 3 months and with more positive maternal behaviors and less stress at 9 months. Analysis evidenced a slight improvement in the intervention group in maternal dispositional mindfulness and a reduction in parenting stress at T2.Discussion Findings from both studies suggested that maternal mindfulness could represent a protective factor that could support mothers in fostering better dyadic interactions with their infants. The implementation of mindfulness-based interventions for mothers could have preventive and clinical implications.

TI  - Well-Being, Mental Health, General Health and Quality of Life Improvement Through Mindfulness-Based Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Mindfulness-based interventions have shown promising therapeutic outcomes in improving well-being, mental health, general health, and quality of life, however, findings in this regard are inconsistent. The present study aimed at clarifying this inconsistency in the literature focusing on the Iranian studies through a systematic review and meta-analysis study.Evidence Acquisition: The databases of Pubmed, Scopus, Doaj, EBSCO, Iranmedex, MagIran, SID, and Comprehensive Human Sciences Portal, and additional resources were searched using the set terms of "mindfulness" OR "mindfulness-based cognitive therapy" OR "MBCT" OR "mindfulness-based stress reduction" OR "MBSR" AND "intervention" AND "well-being" OR "health" OR "quality of life" and the time limit of the records was set between March 2008 and May 2017. The language of search was restricted to English and Farsi. Only studies conducted on Iranian populations were selected in this study. Thirty-five studies conducted on 3013 subjects were assessed. Cochrane Q-test and I-squared index were used to detect the heterogeneity among results, and fixed effect model with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was applied. The effect size of mindfulness-based interventions on well-being, mental health, general health, and quality of life improvement, measured by Hedge's g ratios, were respectively 1.54, 1.08, 0.89, and 1.87. Results: The findings showed that the effect size of mindfulness-based interventions on well-being, mental health, general health, and quality of life improvement were of high magnitude, according to the Cohen's table.Conclusion: Mindfulness-based interventions effectively improved well-being, health, and quality of life.

AB  - Mindfulness, whether distinguished as a state, trait, or training, is central to a growing wave of interest in meditation. Theoretical development has been called for in order to clarify confusion about mindfulness from a scientific perspective. Ideally, such development will allow ingress for more traditional perspectives and guide inclusive research on the wider range of meditation practices. To address this call, we outline a new approach for understanding mindfulness and related meditative experience that accommodates diverse perspectives. In accord with other integrative approaches, we employ foundational psychological constructs (namely, attention, intention, and awareness) to understand mindfulness. In contrast to other theoretical perspectives, however, we utilize this foundation to derive novel psychological constructs needed to better explain mindfulness and important features of meditative experience more widely. The contemplative cognition framework integrates three attention-related processes entailed by a variety of contemplative practices: intended attention, attention to intention, and awareness of transient information. After delineating this set of three processes, we explain how they can cooperate to promote a contemplative range of metacognition about attention, intention, and awareness, as well as enhanced regulation of cognition, emotion, and behavior. The contemplative cognition framework (a) overcomes discrepancies in mindfulness research; (b) accounts for contextual and motivational aspects of training; (c) supports investigation from phenomenological, information processing, neurophysiological, and clinical perspectives; and (d) enables investigations on various contemplative states, traits, and practices to inform one another. This new approach has potential for advancing a more inclusive, productive, and theory-driven science of mindfulness and meditation.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer: A Mixed-Methods Feasibility Study
T2  - INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A recurrence of cancer is a traumatic and stressful experience, and a number of approaches have been proposed to manage or treat the associated psychological distress. Meditative techniques such as mindfulness may be able to improve an individual's ability to cope with stressful life events such as cancer diagnosis or treatment. This single-arm mixed-methods study primarily aimed to determine the feasibility of using a mindfulness-based intervention in managing psychosocial distress in recurrent ovarian cancer. Twenty-eight participants took part in a mindfulness-based program, involving six group sessions, each lasting 1.5 hours and delivered at weekly intervals. The study found that the mindfulness-based intervention was acceptable to women with recurrent ovarian cancer and feasible to deliver within a standard cancer care pathway in a UK hospital setting. The results suggested a positive impact on symptoms of depression and anxiety, but further study is needed to explore the effectiveness of the intervention.

TI  - Modeling the mindfulness-to-meaning theory's mindful reappraisal hypothesis: Replication with longitudinal data from a randomized controlled study
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mindfulness to Meaning Theory provides a detailed process model of the mechanisms by which mindfulness may promote well-being. Central to the Mindfulness to Meaning Theory is the mindful reappraisal hypothesis (MRH), which suggests mindfulness training promotes well-being by facilitating positive reappraisal. Emerging evidence from interconnected domains of research supports the MRH. However, it remains unclear whether mindful reappraisal continues to develop after a mindfulness training course and whether this continued development encourages well-being over time. As such, this randomized controlled study compared participants receiving a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course with participants receiving no mindfulness training on positive reappraisal use and well-being over the course of 6 years. Latent growth curve modeling revealed that mindfulness training increased well-being by significantly increasing the trajectory of positive reappraisal over time. The MRH was then unpacked by examining whether MBSR also stimulated decentering and broadened awareness, core components of the MRH. Multivariate path analysis revealed that mindfulness training increased decentering, which in turn broadened awareness, which was then associated with positive reappraisal, ultimately promoting well-being. Taken together, these findings suggest that MBSR cultivates a downstream cascade of adaptive psychological processes that continue to promote quality of life 6-years after mindfulness training.

TI  - Mindfulness as a complementary intervention in the treatment of overweight and obesity in primary health care: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness has been applied in the United States and Europe to improve physical and psychological health; however, little is known about its feasibility and efficacy in a Brazilian population. Mindfulness may also be relevant in tackling obesity and eating disorders by decreasing binge eating episodes-partly responsible for weight regain for a large number of people- and increasing awareness of emotional and other triggers for overeating. The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and efficacy of two mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) addressing overweight and obesity in primary care patients: a general programme called Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and a targeted mindful eating protocol called Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training.Methods/design: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare treatment as usual separately in primary care with both programmes (health promotion and mindful eating) added to treatment as usual. Two hundred forty adult women with overweight and obesity will be enrolled. The primary outcome will be an assessment of improvement in eating behaviour. Secondary outcomes will be (1) biochemical control; (2) anthropometric parameters, body composition, dietary intake and basal metabolism; and (3) levels of mindfulness, stress, depression, self-compassion and anxiety. At the end of each intervention, a focus group will be held to assess the programme's impact on the participants' lives, diet and health. A feasibility study on access to benefits from and importance of MBIs at primary care facilities will be conducted among primary care health care professionals and participants. Monthly maintenance sessions lasting at least 1 hour will be offered, according to each protocol, during the 3-month follow-up periods.Discussion: This clinical trial will result in more effective mindfulness-based interventions as a complementary treatment in primary care for people with overweight and obesity. If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of mindfulness programmes in this population, it will be possible to improve quality of life and health while optimising public resources and reaching a greater number of people. In addition, on the basis of the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing this intervention in primary care facilities, we expect to be able to suggest the intervention for incorporation into public policy.

TI  - Finding kindness: A randomized controlled trial of an online self-compassion intervention for weight management (SC4WM)
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Weight loss is hard to achieve and even harder to maintain. Engaging in effortful behavioural change to manage body weight can sometimes result in feelings of guilt and shame. Self-compassion, the tendency to find kindness for oneself in times of struggle, may facilitate coping with the unique challenges of weight management. This study assessed whether a remotely delivered self-compassion intervention improved weight management outcomes when delivered as a supplement to an existing digital behavioural weight management programme, Weight Watchers (WW).Method: Using a mixed-method study design, 249 adults seeking to manage weight were randomized to either the WW programme or WW supplemented with the self-compassion for weight management intervention (SC4WM). Participants completed measures of self-compassion, eating behaviour, physical activity, body weight and emotional well-being along with potential moderators, including weight self- stigma, eating restraint, psychological coping and perceived stress at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks).Results: There was no evidence that the SC4WM intervention had a significantly different effect than WW alone. Other than body weight, all outcomes improved over time in both groups. Self-compassion was slightly higher overall in the SC4WM group (p =.05), with this group reporting higher self-kindness at 4 weeks (p =.014) and lower self-judgement at 12 weeks (p =.023) compared to the control group.Conclusions: Although the SC4WM intervention group did show a small increase in self-kindness and reduction in self-judgement, weight management outcomes were not improved over and above the existing WW programme. Recommendations for adapting the SC4WM intervention to improve efficacy to augment weight management outcomes are provided.

TI  - Mindfulness and Self-Compassion in Clinical Psychiatric Rehabilitation: a Clinical Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Previous research has suggested Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) as being beneficial for people dealing with a variety of mental health issues in outpatient area. Method A clinical trial was conducted with 200 psychiatric inpatients testing the efficacy of a specially designed 6-week MSC program compared with a control intervention of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Each session lasted 75 min and took place once a week for each of the study groups. The primary end-point was the change in the self-compassion scale (SCS) total score from pre- to post treatment. Secondary end-points included changes in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18), and subjective feeling of happiness (single item). Results Of the 200 randomly assigned participants, the MSC group (M = 2.90, SD = 0.5) showed a significant improvement in SCS (F(1,198) = 25.57, p < .01, eta(2) = 0.11) after 6 weeks in comparison with the PMR group (M = 2.57, SD = 0.6, p > .05). Correspondingly, the MSC group stated a greater amount of happiness in comparison to the PMR group (p < .05). Furthermore, the GSI and SF-36 parameters improved in both study groups to the same extent during the 6-week treatment (p < .01). Conclusions These preliminary data suggest the clinical applicability of MSC in psychiatric patient groups, which merits further large-scale studies.

TI  - The efficacy of a Mindfulness Based Intervention for depressive symptoms in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and their caregivers: study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Multiple Sclerosis has a great impact on psychological functioning of patients and can be associated with various mental health disorders and symptoms. The most prevalent one is depression, which ranges from 15 to 47 %.Mindfulness Based Interventions are a relatively brief and cost-effective program that has been studied in patients with several chronic diseases and recently also in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Mindfulness Based Interventions are based on the assumption that a non-judgmental awareness and acceptance of one's moment-to-moment experience can have a positive effect on the adaptation to the disease, reducing the psychological burden and improving patients' quality of life. Several studies concluded that Mindfulness Based Interventions can be beneficial in terms of improving both psychological and psychical aspects of Multiple Sclerosis, but none of them compared the intervention with an active control group. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a group-based Mindfulness Based Intervention on depressive symptoms in patients with Multiple Sclerosis, as compared with an active control group.Methods: The study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Eighty-eight patients with Multiple Sclerosis and depressive symptoms will be recruited and randomized to either Mindfulness Based Intervention or an active control group. The latter is designed to control for non-specific elements of the intervention and it comprises psycho-education and relaxation techniques. The primary outcome is the reduction of depressive symptoms as measured via the Beck Depressive Inventory-II. Secondary outcome measures are level of quality of life, anxiety, perceived stress, illness perception, fatigue and quality of interpersonal relationship. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, after treatment and 6 months after the end of the treatment. Caregivers will participate in groups together with patients.Discussion: As far as we know this trial will be the first randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of groupbased Mindfulness Based Intervention for patients with Multiple Sclerosis with a comparison with an active control group with a specific focus on depressive symptoms.

TI  - Mindfulness as a tool for reducing stress in healthcare professionals: An umbrella review
T2  - WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care providers (HCPs) and health care students experience a huge amount of stress due to high workloads and pressure to perform and are likely to develop anxiety, depression and burnout.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to carry out an umbrella review of systematic and narrative reviews on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing stress and improving well-being in HCPs and health care students.METHODS: Systematic and narrative reviews that examined the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on HCPs and healthcare students' perceived stress were identified through a systematic search of three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science.RESULTS: Fifteen articles were included in the analysis: eleven systematic and four narrative reviews. Studies' quality varied from critically low to high. The different interventions showed positive results in reducing stress in both HCPs and students, with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course having the major impact.CONCLUSIONS: MBSR techniques and other mindfulness-based interventions resulted to be potentially effective in reducing stress. However, despite the vast amount of data collected by the studies and the promising results, several limitations affected the validity of the studies. Therefore, more research that considers the critical aspects of this field is required, in order to provide more reliable results.

TI  - Interpersonal and individual effects of an app-based Christian and Islamic heart meditation intervention in healthy adults: protocol of a stratified randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe academic development and widespread adoption of meditation practices for well-being and therapy have predominantly focused on secularised adaptations of Buddhist and Hindu techniques. This study aims to expand the field by investigating Christian and Islamic meditation that emphasize the spiritual significance of the heart through elements of visualisation and recitation. It compares the effects of spiritual heart-centred meditation with mindfulness meditation and a waitlist control, focusing on dimensions of social functioning, psychophysiology, cognition, and mental health.MethodThis study employs a stratified 3-arm randomised controlled method with mixed-method repeated measures across three assessment time points: before intervention (T1), after an 8-week intervention (T2), and at a 3-month follow up (T3). The three conditions include spiritual meditation (either Christian or Islamic), mindfulness meditation (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction - MBSR), and a waitlist. Participants will be stratified into Christian and Muslim samples and randomly allocated to the spiritual meditation, MBSR, or waitlist control conditions. Importantly, participants assigned to the spiritual meditation condition will be matched to the spiritual meditation program corresponding to their religion. The intervention will be administered through a mobile phone app with daily 20-minute guided meditation sessions for eight weeks. Primary outcomes pertain to the domain of interpersonal functioning, focusing on prosociality, forgiveness, empathy, and perspective taking. Secondary outcomes include physiology: pain tolerance, pain intensity, stress reactivity assessed via heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), psychophysiological reactivity associated with a forgiveness task as measured through HR and HRV, attention (alerting, orienting, and executive attention networks), and mental health (stress, depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, positive and negative affect).DiscussionThis trial aims to test the effects of an app-based Christian and Islamic meditation, compared to secular mindfulness and a waitlist, using a randomised controlled trial. If the results yield positive outcomes, this study will support the efficacy of these contemplations, offering practitioners a way to enhance their well-being within their religious framework.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06136676.

TI  - The Effects of Zentangle on Affective Well-Being Among Adults: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
T2  - The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Zentangle is a self-help art modality purported to have repetitive, mindful, and meditative qualities. It can be a cost-effective intervention, but its effect on affective well-being has been underresearched.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate and 2-wk postintervention effects of Zentangle delivered by a certified Zentangle teacher on affective well-being in the general population.DESIGN: Two-armed parallel-groups pilot randomized controlled trial.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight participants from a nonclinical population.INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized into the Zentangle group, which participated in a 2-hr Zentangle class and were encouraged to practice for 2 wk, or the waitlist control group. Participants learned basic Zentangle principles and drew two Zentangles under the teacher's instructions.OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form were used to assess positive and negative affect; depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; and self-compassion.RESULTS: Significant reductions in negative affect were found in the Zentangle group compared with the waitlist control group at both immediate and 2-wk postintervention assessments (ds = 1.04 and 0.79, respectively, p < .001). Participants who practiced Zentangle for >80 min per week had a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and an improvement in self-compassion (ds = 0.84 and 0.24, ps < .05 and .005, respectively). No significant between-groups difference was found for other measures.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results shed light on the effects of Zentangle on improving affective well-being in the general population. With sufficient practice, Zentangle can also help improve self-compassion and reduce anxiety. What This Article Adds: The results of this study could provide information to determine whether Zentangle can be used as a tool in occupational therapy intervention to improve affective well-being.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based interventions on symptoms and interoception in trauma-related disorders and exposure to traumatic events: Systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Interoception is defined as the sense of the internal state of the body. Dysfunctions in interoception are found in several mental disorders, including trauma-related conditions. Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) have been shown to influence interoceptive processes. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated whether MBIs impact symptoms and interoception in patients with trauma-related disorders. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize these data. We included RCTs with an MBI arm which enrolled adult patients with trauma related-disorders or exposure to a traumatic experience, and addressed changes in interoception and trauma-related symptoms. A random-effects multivariate meta-analytic model was performed to quantify group differences in score change from baseline to follow-up. Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, and eleven in the meta-analysis. Overall, MBIs showed small to moderate positive effects on both interoception and symptoms. Despite a high heterogeneity in results, sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. We conclude that the efficacy of MBIs on trauma-related symptoms and interoception is supported by randomised evidence. However, further research is needed to understand whether changes in interoception might underpin the effectiveness of MBIs in trauma-related disorders.

TI  - Mindful Self-Compassion Smartphone Intervention for Worker Mental Health in Japan:Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mental health problems among workers cause enormous losses to companies in Japan. However, workers have been considered to have limited access to psychological support because of time constraints, which makes it difficult for them to engage in face-to-face psychological support interventions. Objective: This study aimed to present an intervention protocol that describes a randomized controlled trial to examine whether brief guided mindfulness meditation (MM) or self-compassion meditation (SCM) provided by a smartphone app is effective for mental health and work-related outcomes among workers. Methods: This is an open-label, 3-arm randomized controlled trial. The participants will be recruited through an open call on relevant websites with the following inclusion criteria: (1) employees who are working more than 20 hours per week, (2) between the ages of 18 and 54 years, (3) not on a leave of absence, (4) not business owners or students, and (5) not currently diagnosed with a mental disorder and have a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6 score below 13 points. We will include 200 participants and randomly assign them to an SCM course (n=67), an MM course (n=67), and a waitlist group (n=66). The intervention groups (SCM and MM) will be instructed to engage in daily guided self-help, self-compassion, and MMs lasting 6-12 minutes per day over 4 weeks. Primary outcomes will include psychological distress and job performance, and secondary outcomes will include somatic symptoms, cognitive flexibility, self-esteem, self-compassion, perceived stress, well-being, emotion regulation, work engagement, anger, psychological safety, and creativity. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Tokyo (22-326). All participants will be informed of the study via the websites, and written informed consent will be collected via web-based forms. Results: The recruitment of participants began in December 2022, and the intervention began in January 2023. As of September 2023, a total of 375 participants have been enrolled. The intervention and data collection were completed in late October 2023. Conclusions: This study will contribute to the development of effective self-care intervention content that will improve mental health, work performance, and related outcomes and promote mindful and self-compassionate attitudes when faced with distress.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions for the Treatment of Smoking: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Smoking is a chronic process in which craving and negative affect are considered the main barriers to maintaining abstinence in patients who have gone through treatment. Mindfulness-based interventions have presented encouraging preliminary results in follow-up lasting up to 6 months. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions for the treatment of smoking.Methods: Of 198 articles on mindfulness and smoking, 13 controlled empirical studies were selected for the analysis. The search included papers published through April 14, 2014. The databases used were Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus.Results: Scientific interest on mindfulness-based interventions for the treatment of smoking has increased over the past decade. All articles reported promising results, especially for smoking cessation, relapse prevention, number of cigarettes smoked, the moderation of mindfulness on the strength of relationship between craving and smoking, and the development of coping strategies to deal with triggers to smoke. Most of the articles corresponded to pilot or feasibility randomized controlled trials with low risk of bias regarding random sequence generation, attrition, and reporting. However, few articles reported sufficient data on selection, performance, and detection bias.Conclusions: Mindfulness appears to induce positive effects on mental health, which might contribute to the maintenance of tobacco abstinence. Despite the promising results regarding the responses of tobacco smokers to mindfulness-based interventions, additional well-designed clinical studies are needed.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Effectiveness of Self-Compassion-Related Interventions for Individuals With Chronic Physical Health Conditions
T2  - BEHAVIOR THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Self-compassion, defined as a mindful way of coping with pain and suffering by showing kindness, care, and concern towards the self, may improve psychological adjustment in people living with a chronic physical health condition (CPHC). Various studies illustrate that self-compassion is associated with positive outcomes in general. The aim of this systematic review is to establish the effect of compassion-related therapies on self-compassion specifically in people with CPHCs. Secondary aims are to (a) establish the effect on other psychological and physiological outcomes and (b) explore the relative effectiveness of different therapy types among those identified. Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Psy-cINFO, and CINAHL databases were searched using "compassion" AND "chronic disease" AND "psychological outcomes" and their synonyms, from 2004 to March 2019. Eligible studies had an experimental design using a self-compassion scale with an adult population. Risk of bias (RoB)was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool. Effect sizes were calculated for study outcomes. Fifteen studies, including a total of 1,190 participants, 7 different CPHCs, and 11 types of therapies, were included in the review. Nearly all included therapies significantly increased self-compassion with medi-um to large effect sizes, and reported positive outcomes, such as decreased depression. None of the therapy types appeared clearly superior to the others. Findings from this review show that included therapies increased self-compassion and im -proved various outcomes, which may represent clinically significant benefits for patients. However, there is a need to further understand how self-compassion exerts its benefits and determine the best methods to increase self-compassion.

TI  - Longitudinal impact of mindfulness meditation on illness burden in solid-organ transplant recipients.
T2  - Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2001, more than 24000 solid-organ transplant surgeries were performed in the United States. Although survival rates have steadily risen over the past 2 decades, transplant recipients commonly experience a myriad of symptoms after transplantation that compromise quality of life. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia frequently occur despite excellent function of the transplanted organ. Use of complementary and alternative medicine has risen sharply over the past 10 years, particularly among people with chronic illnesses.METHODS: Twenty solid-organ transplant recipients were enrolled in a clinical trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction. During the 8-week course, subjects learned various forms of meditation and gentle hatha yoga. Participants were given audiotapes for home practice and maintained practice diaries. Longitudinal analysis focused on the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management, illness intrusion, and transplant-related stressors.RESULTS: Significant improvements in the quality and duration of sleep continued for 6 months after completion of the mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Improvements after the completion of the course were also noted in self-report measures of anxiety and depression.CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based stress reduction is an effective treatment in improving the quality and duration of sleep. Because sleep is highly correlated with positive mental health and overall well-being, these findings suggest that mindfulness-based stress reduction has the potential of being an effective, accessible and low-cost intervention that could significantly change transplant recipients' overall health and well-being.

TI  - The role of mindfulness in physical activity: a systematic review
T2  - OBESITY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite continued public health campaigns to promote physical activity, a majority of the population is inactive. In recent years, mindfulness-based approaches have been used in health and lifestyle interventions for physical activity promotion. We conducted a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to investigate the evidence for the potential of mindfulness-based approaches for physical activity. We searched electronic databases for papers that met eligibility criteria and identified 40 studies for inclusion. Evidence from cross-sectional studies (n = 20) indicated a positive relationship between dispositional mindfulness and physical activity, particularly with psychological factors related to physical activity. Five studies found that the mindfulness-physical activity relationship was mediated by stress, psychological flexibility, negative affect and shame, satisfaction and state mindfulness. Evidence from mindfulness-based interventions (n = 20) suggested positive between-subjects effects on physical activity, but interventions varied in duration, session length, group size, delivery, content and follow-up. Mindfulness-based interventions were more likely to be successful if they were physical activity-specific and targeted psychological factors related to physical activity. The body of research shows a need for more methodologically rigorous studies to establish the effect of mindfulness on physical activity and to identify potential mechanisms involved in the mindfulness-physical activity relationship reliably.

TI  - Metta-based group meditation and individual cognitive behavioral therapy (MeCBT) for chronic depression: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Depression is a widespread disorder with severe impacts for individuals and society, especially in its chronic form. Current treatment approaches for persistent depression have focused primarily on reducing negative affect and have paid little attention to promoting positive affect. Previous studies have shown that metta meditation increases positive affect in chronically depressed patients. Results from previous trials provide evidence for the efficacy of a stand-alone metta meditation group treatment in combination with mindfulness-based approaches. Further research is needed to better understand the implementation of meditation practice into everyday life. Therefore, mindfulness and metta meditation in a group setting are combined with individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into a new, low-intensity, cost-effective treatment ("MeCBT") for chronic depression. Methods/design In this single-center, randomized, observer-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial we will test the efficacy of MeCBT in reducing depression compared to a wait-list control condition. Forty-eight participants in a balanced design will be allocated randomly to a treatment group or a wait-list control group. Metta-based group meditation will be offered in eight weekly sessions and one additional half-day retreat. Subsequent individual CBT will be conducted in eight fortnightly sessions. Outcome measures will be assessed at four time points: before intervention (T0); after group meditation (T1); after individual CBT (T2); and, in the treated group only, at 6-month follow-up (T3). Changes in depressive symptoms (clinician rating), assessed with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-C) are the primary outcome. We expect a significant decline of depressive symptoms at T2 compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary outcome measures include self-rated depression, mindfulness, benevolence, rumination, emotion regulation, social connectedness, social functioning, as well as behavioral and cognitive avoidance. We will explore changes at T1 and T2 in all these secondary outcome variables. Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study to combine a group program focusing on Metta meditation with state-of-the art individual CBT specifically tailored to chronic depression. Implications for further refinement and examination of the treatment program are discussed.

AB  - Cancer poses substantial challenges to both physical and mental health of patients. On the other hand, breast canceris one of the most common cancers among Iranian women. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigatethe effect of mindfulness-based training on psychological status and quality of life (QoL) of patients with breast cancerliving in Ilam, Iran. This quasi-experimental study was performed on 66 patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Thepatients assigned into two groups of experimental and control. Experimental group received mindfulness-based grouptraining through eight 90-min sessions. Sessions were conducted twice a week and were completed within 1 month.The research tools included a QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Schneiders life expectancy questionnaire, andthe depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21). The questionnaires were completed before and during the interviewswith the patients 2 months after intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16) and running descriptive andanalytical statistics. Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between he experimental and controlgroups considering QoL, life expectancy, depression, anxiety, and stress (p>0.05). However, after the intervention, thepatients in the experimental group reported higher QoL and life expectancy and less severe depression, anxiety, andstress (p < 0.05). Considering the positive effect of mindfulness-based training on the psychological status and QoLof patients with breast cancer, we recommend health nurses conduct mindfulness-based training for patients receivingclinical care services.

TI  - Metacognitive Interpersonal Mindfulness-Based Training for Worry About Interpersonal Events A Pilot Feasibility and Acceptability Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Individuals with personality disorders experience worry and repetitive thoughts regarding interpersonal scenarios. Mainstream mindfulness-based approaches may be insufficient to soothe these individual's distress due to difficulties in letting thoughts go and refocusing attention to the present moment. For this reason, we devised an adapted form of mindfulness-based program called Metacognitive Interpersonal Mindfulness-Based Training (MIMBT) for personality disorders. In this pilot study, 28 individuals attended nine weekly sessions to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability, and to establish preliminary outcomes. All individuals completed the program. Attendance was very high (96%). Significant changes were observed on the primary outcome of reduction in repetitive thinking, measured using the Metacognition Questionnaire-30. We also observed a decrease in depression severity. Despite important limitations, this pilot study suggests that MIMBT has the potential to be a viable and well-accepted option for increasing positive outcomes in the treatment of personality disorders. Clinical considerations and directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Comparison of the Effectiveness of an Abbreviated Program versus a Standard Program in Mindfulness, Self-Compassion and Self-Perceived Empathy in Tutors and Resident Intern Specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing in Spain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Health professionals are among the most vulnerable to work stress and emotional exhaustion problems. These health professionals include tutors and resident intern specialists, due to the growing demand for the former and the high work overload of the latter. Mindfulness training programs can support these professionals during times of crisis, such as the current global pandemic caused by the coronavirus-19 disease. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an abbreviated Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training program in relation to a standard training program on the levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-perceived empathy in tutors and resident intern specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing. A total of 112 professionals attached to six Spanish National Health System teaching units (TUs) participated in this randomized and controlled clinical trial. Experimental Group (GE) participants were included in the standard or abbreviated MBSR programs. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale short form (SCS-SF), and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) were administered three times during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant increase in mindfulness (F-(2,F-91) = 3.271; p = 0.042; eta(2) = 0.067) and self-compassion (F-(2,F-91) = 6.046; p = 0.003; eta(2) = 0.117) in the post-test visit, and in self-compassion (F-(2,F-79) = 3.880; p = 0.025; eta(2) = 0.089) in the follow-up visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program. The standard MBSR and MSC training program improves levels of mindfulness and self-compassion, and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and resident intern specialists. New studies are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of abbreviated training programs.

TI  - What Are You Hungry for? The 9 Hunger Mindful Eating Online Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesMindful eating (ME) has been receiving increased attention in the treatment of eating and weight disorders. In this context, the ME approach is assumed to help modify maladaptive eating behaviors. This work investigated the effects of a brief ME intervention that focused on the non-judgmental awareness of different motivations to eat in order to study this mechanism.MethodUsing a randomized controlled trial design, participants were allocated to an intervention group (IG; n = 87) or waitlist control group (W-CG; n = 137). For a 2-week training phase, participants of the IG were instructed to take a mindful moment to rate their different motivations to eat once per day. Self-report data on emotional eating, external eating, and loss of control eating (primary outcomes) and intuitive eating, ME, mental well-being, and self-compassion (secondary outcomes) were gathered online pre, post, and 3 months after the training. Latent change score (LCS) models were used to estimate shorter and longer term effects of the intervention.ResultsLCS revealed significant shorter and longer term effects of the training when comparing data of the IG with those of the W-CG regarding all primary (d = 0.38-0.61) and most secondary outcomes (d = 0.29-1.16).ConclusionsThe positive and sustainable effects of practicing this clearly outlined ME skill over a short period support the idea that ME might be a promising approach to enrich the current treatment of eating and weight disorders and aid in expanding our understanding of the underlying mechanisms on its application in the field.PreregistrationThis study was preregistered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00012351).

TI  - Immediate and Lasting Chronic Pain Reduction Following a Brief Self-Implemented Mindfulness-Based Interoceptive Exposure Task: a Pilot Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent imaging research shows that approximately 80% of people who transit from acute to chronic pain produce neuroplasticity linking pain pathways to learning areas of the brain, thus showing physiological evidence that chronic pain is largely learned. Mindfulness meditation programs have been used successfully to teach people a way of decreasing pain-related distress and unlearning their unhelpful relationship to pain. However, not all chronic pain patients are amenable to undergo a full mindfulness program and then maintain daily practice. Accordingly, we conducted a pilot study of a task extracted from a second-generation MBI, Mindfulness-integrated Cognitive Behavior Therapy, which consisted of a self-guided 30-s mindfulness-based interoceptive exposure task (MIET) to pain sensations in 15 medically diagnosed chronic pain patients. Participants using the MIET repeatedly over 15 days learned not to identify with pain and focused on four subcomponents of interoception (mass, motion, temperature, and cohesiveness) while remaining equanimous. This led to significant reduction in pain anxiety (p = .001; d = 0.96), pain duration (p = .01; d = 0.86), and pain intensity after each 30-s exposure (p < .001; d = 1.37). These effects were maintained, and some further improved, at 2-month follow-up. Marked decrease in depression, anxiety and stress were also observed (p < .001; d = 0.81). While participants rated the task as highly acceptable and some reduced their use of analgesic medication; no other change in medical or psychological treatment was required. These early results show the potential for the MIET to be use as an adjunct to traditional treatments of chronic pain, although controlled studies are needed to establish the validity of our results. Brain-imaging studies are also needed to assess the possible unlearning effect of the MIET on corticolimbic regions, a process that may be termed "central desensitization."

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Parents and teachers of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at-risk for a range of suboptimal psychosocial outcomes, including mental health difficulties and heightened stress, problems perhaps ameliorated through mindfulness-based programming.Objective: To show pilot data from an investigation of the outcomes of a purpose-built mindfulness training for parents and teachers of children with ADHD (N = 26).Methods: The program represents a purpose-driven modification of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) curriculum. Namely, we reduced participant time commitment and added psycho-education about ADHD with brief parent training. The measurement protocol included measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness.Results: Following the 8-week program, parents and teachers reported reduced perceived stress, reduced self-reported anxiety, and improvements in some facets of mindfulness.Conclusion: The work highlights the promise of specialized mindfulness-based interventions in promoting positive psychosocial outcomes in specific at-risk groups, such as the carers of children with ADHD.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Horner and Sugai provide lessons learned from their work with disseminating the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) model. While PBIS represents an empirical school-wide approach for maladaptive student behaviors, the model appears to have limitations regarding sociocultural values and behavioral data collection practices. The current paper provides an overview of three identified areas for improvement and outlines how administrators using PBIS can incorporate acceptance and mindfulness-based intervention procedures to address the discussed limitations.

TI  - A Low-Intensity Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Mood Symptoms in People with Early Psychosis: Development and Pilot Evaluation
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are common in people suffering from early psychosis. Growing evidence shows that mindfulness-based intervention is an effective option in handling depression and anxiety disorders. Current article aims to provide documentation on the development and pilot study, before a RCT of larger scale, evaluating the acceptability and potential effects of a 7-week mindfulness-based intervention programme (MBI-p).Method: MBI-p was developed over nine months in 2014. A total of 14 people with early psychosis were recruited to three pilot trials of MBI-p. Eleven of them completed the programme and were interviewed. Eight of them were measured quantitatively at baseline and post-intervention on clinical symptoms, depression and anxiety levels, quality of life and mindfulness.Results: Mixed qualitative and quantitative results supported MBI-p as an acceptable and feasible intervention. Significant statistical improvements were found in depression levels, mental quality of life, general psychopathology and ability to observe emotions and act with awareness. Qualitative comments suggested that the intervention was safe, enjoyable and had a positive impact on mood symptoms. In summary, these results provide a promising pilot support for a potentially effective and cost-efficient treatment option for people with early psychosis. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of the study was to examine mindfulness-based meditation therapy qualitatively. A secondary goal was to examine the differences in themes selected by Japanese and Western patients receiving this therapy.The subjects were 28 patients who were undergoing anti-cancer treatment. The subjects participated in two sessions of mindfulness-based meditation therapy, including breathing, yoga movement, and meditation. Each patient was taught the program in the first session, then exercised at home with a CD, and subsequently met the interviewer in a second session after 2 weeks. Primary physicians recruited the patients and interviews were conducted individually by nurses or psychologists with training in the program. Patients provided answers to pre- and post-intervention interviews about the meaning of their illness.Narrative data from the semi-structured interview were analyzed qualitatively. Pre-intervention, themes such as "Effort to cope," "Looking back," "Spirituality," "Personal growth," and "Suffering" were often chosen. Post-intervention, themes such as "Adapted coping," "Personal growth," "Positive meaning," "Spirituality," and "Negative recognition" were more commonly chosen.Mindfulness-based meditation therapy may be effective for producing adapted coping, including positive recognition and changes for an adapted lifestyle. There were some common aspects and some differences in the themes selected by patients in this study and Western patients received mindfulness therapy in other studies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This experimental research examined the effects of the Mindfulness-Based Thriving Program (MTP) on university students' mindfulness and thriving levels. Method: The study was conducted with randomly assigned 19 female students attending to a public university in Turkey. The inclusion criteria were to have low scores on Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and Thriving Scale in pre-test assessment. Experimental group (n=10) received a 6-session MTP intervention developed by the first researcher while control group (n=9) received no intervention. To determine the immediate and long-term effects of the MTP, all participants completed post-tests two months after the program. Data were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA test. To determine the significant differences between subgroups, the Tukey (HSD) test was performed. Results: Post-test and follow-up results of experimental group for MAAS and Thriving Scale were found to be higher than their pre-test results, while there were no statistically significant changes in results of control group. Results revealed that six-session MTP for university students was significantly effective in increasing mindfulness and thriving levels. Discussion: Research results highlight the potential contribution of eclectic mindfulness practices during adolescence. Although, there are many studies supporting the positive effect of mindfulness-based interventions on students, empirical evidence about MTP's effect on thriving is very scarce. In this respect, this study is expected to contribute the current literature by examining the MTP's effect on mindfulness and thriving.

TI  - Positive Impact of Mindfulness Meditation on Mental Health of Female Teachers during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures were shown to impact negatively on people's mental health. In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female teachers (n= 66, age: 51.5 +/- 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality profiles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality profiles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR,n= 32) and a high-resilience (HR,n= 26) group. The LR and HR groups differed at baseline in most of the self-report measures. Pre-post MOM significant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, affective empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can effectively mitigate the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.

TI  - Features of Self-Organization during the Process of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction: A Single Case Study
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to the extensive evidence of the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions, there is only a limited understanding of their mechanisms of change. The three aims of this study are (1) to identify features of self-organization during the process (e.g., pattern transitions), (2) to obtain an impression of the effects of continuous self-assessments and feedback sessions on mindfulness-related stress reduction, and (3) to test the feasibility of high-frequency process monitoring and process feedback. Concerning aim (1), the specific hypothesis is that change will occur as a cascade of discontinuous pattern transitions emerging spontaneously in the sense of not being a reaction to external input. This single case study describes changing patterns of multiple time series that were produced by app-based daily self-assessments during and after an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. After this MBSR program, the participant (a female nurse) continued the self-assessment and the mindfulness practice for a further 10 months. The results confirm findings on the positive effects of mindfulness programs for healthcare professionals, especially on coping with work-related stress. The analysis of the time series data supports the hypothesis of self-organization as a possible mechanism of change manifesting as a cascade of phase transitions in the dynamics of a biopsychosocial system. At the end of the year, the participant reported a beneficial impact of daily monitoring and systematic feedback on the change process. The results underline the feasibility and usefulness of continuous high-frequency monitoring during and after mindfulness interventions.

TI  - Depression and Anxiety Disorders: Benefits of Exercise, Yoga, and Meditation
T2  - AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Many people with depression or anxiety turn to nonpharmacologic and nonconventional interventions, including exercise, yoga, meditation, tai chi, or qi gong. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown that these interventions can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. As an adjunctive treatment, exercise seems most helpful for treatment-resistant depression, unipolar depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Yoga as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy shows positive effects, particularly for depression. As an adjunctive therapy, it facilitates treatment of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder. Tai chi and qi gong may be helpful as adjunctive therapies for depression, but effects are inconsistent. As monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy, mindfulness-based meditation has positive effects on depression, and its effects can last for six months or more. Although positive findings are less common in people with anxiety disorders, the evidence supports adjunctive use. There are no apparent negative effects of mindfulness-based interventions, and their general health benefits justify their use as adjunctive therapy for patients with depression and anxiety disorders.

TI  - Challenge or Threat? The Effects of the Standard and a Second-Generation Mindfulness Intervention with Buddhist Practices on Cognitive Appraisals of Stress: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Experiment Performed in Switzerland
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Contemplative approaches rooted in Buddhist traditions have been linked to the attenuation of response to social stress. Anticipatory cognitive appraisals of social situations potentially represent a mechanism explaining the stress-reducing effects of contemplative practices. The cognitive appraisal of threat is associated with an anticipated loss of social self-esteem. In contrast, the cognitive appraisal of challenge involves recognizing the potential for gain or growth in stressful situations and is associated with a more adaptive cardiovascular response. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled experiment performed in Switzerland, we evaluated the effects of two contemplative interventions on cognitive appraisals of challenge and threat and associated physiological profiles. The interventions were a standard Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program and a new program (MBSR-B), which included several elements from Buddhist practices. After an eight-week intervention, participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and underwent the assessment of primary cognitive appraisals and cardiovascular response to stress. The results demonstrated greater challenge appraisal in the MBSR (n = 20) and MBSR-B (n = 21) groups compared to Control (n = 24), and MBSR-B participants scored higher on the challenge than threat appraisal. At the physiological level, the groups did not differ on changes in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Still, an exploratory analysis demonstrated that the MBSR-B group's cardiovascular profile best resembled challenge appraisal. The results suggest that contemplative approaches foster challenge appraisal, contributing to a more adaptive response to stress.

T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe increasing integration of digital technologies into daily life has spurred a growing body of research in the field of digital psychology. This research has shed light on the potential benefits and drawbacks of digital technologies for mental health and well-being. However, the intricate relationship between technology and psychology remains largely unexplored.PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps on university students' anxiety, loneliness, and well-being. Additionally, it sought to explore participants' perceptions of the addictiveness of these apps.MethodThe research utilized a multi-phase approach, encompassing a correlational research method, a pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial, and a qualitative case study. Participants were segmented into three subsets: correlations (n = 300), treatment (n = 60), and qualitative (n = 20). Data were gathered from various sources, including the social anxiety scale, well-being scale, social media use integration scale, and an interview checklist. Quantitative data was analyzed using Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and t-tests, while qualitative data underwent thematic analysis.ResultsThe study uncovered a significant correlation between social media use and the variables under investigation. Moreover, the treatment involving mindfulness-based mobile apps led to a reduction in students' anxiety and an enhancement of their well-being. Notably, participants held various positive perceptions regarding the use of these apps.ImplicationsThe findings of this research hold both theoretical and practical significance for the field of digital psychology. They provide insight into the potential of mindfulness-based mobile apps to positively impact university students' mental health and well-being. Additionally, the study underscores the need for further exploration of the intricate dynamics between technology and psychology in an increasingly digital world.

TI  - Effects of Mindful Engagement and Attention on Reciprocal Caregiver and Client Interactions: A Behavioral Analysis of Moment-to-Moment Changes During Mindfulness Practice
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to examine the effects of Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) training on the nature of caregiver and client reciprocal interactions at a moment-by-moment level using behavior analytic methodology. Specifically, we compared the behavior of caregivers and clients before and after MBPBS training for the caregivers in terms of caregiver-client engagement, percent of learning and leisure interactions during caregiver-client engagement, and percent of the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors during learning and leisure interactions. In addition, we examined the effects of specific conditionality of attentional responses of the caregivers to the clients' challenging or socially acceptable behavior in terms of frequency, latency, duration, and quality.MethodCaregiver and client engagements were videotaped before and after MBPBS training for the caregivers. The percent of caregiver-client engagement was analyzed using partial-interval recording for overall engagement and the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors during learning and leisure interactions. The effects of the caregivers' attentional responses to the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors were analyzed using whole-interval recording.ResultsTraining caregivers in MBPBS significantly increased caregiver-client engagement during learning and leisure activities, which resulted in the clients exhibiting fewer challenging behaviors and more socially appropriate behaviors. Furthermore, an analysis of the effects of different types of caregiver attention showed differential effects on the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors.ConclusionsThe results indicated that behavior analytic methods can be used as an objective and reliable way of capturing the nature of changes in predefined behaviors of both caregivers and clients at a moment-by-moment level following training of the caregivers in a mindfulness-based program. Using such an analytic method may provide an effective way of objectively measuring some experiential processes involved in mindfulness training.

A1  - Collaborative Grp MINDUUDD Study
TI  - Controlled clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of a mindfulness and self-compassion 4-session programme versus an 8-session programme to reduce work stress and burnout in family and community medicine physicians and nurses: MINDUUDD study protocol
T2  - BMC FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Health personnel are susceptible to high levels of work stress and burnout due to the psychological and emotional demands of their work, as well as to other aspects related to the organisation of that work. This paper describes the rationale and design of the MINDUUDD study, the aim of which is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness and self-compassion 4-session programme versus the standard 8-session programme to reduce work stress and burnout in Family and Community Medicine and Nursing tutors and residents.Methods: The MINDUDD study is a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms. Six Teaching Units will be randomised to one of the three study groups: 1) Experimental Group-8 (EG8); 2) Experimental Group-4 (EG4) Control group (CG). At least 132 subjects will participate (66 tutors/66 residents), 44 in the EG8, 44 in the EG4, and 44 in the CG. Interventions will be based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, including some self-compassion practices of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) programme. The EG8 intervention will be implemented during 8 weekly face-to-face sessions of 2.5 h each, while the EG4 intervention will consist of 4 sessions of 2.5 h each. The participants will have to practice at home for 30 min/day in the EG8 and 15 min/day in the EG4. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), and Goldberg Anxiety-Depression Scale (GADS) will be administered. Measurements will be taken at baseline, at the end of the programs, and at three months after completion. The effect of the interventions will be evaluated by bivariate and multivariate analyses (Multiple Linear Regression).Discussion: If the abbreviated mindfulness programme is at least as effective as the standard program, its incorporation into the curriculum and training plans will be easier and more appropriate. It will also be more easily applied and accepted by primary care professionals because of the reduced resources and means required for its implementation, and it may also extend beyond care settings to academic and teaching environments as well.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training on Healthcare Professionals' Mental Health: Results from a Pilot Study Testing Its Predictive Validity in a Specialized Hospital Setting
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training and to examine positive and negative symptom-focused mental health variables. The mental health variables were used to test the predictive validity of the training among healthcare professionals. Thirty healthcare professionals participated in this non-randomized pre-post intervention pilot study. The questionnaire on mental health was filled in twice. Baseline and post-intervention differences were tested with paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The participants' evaluation of the training was assessed with a five-item questionnaire. The recruitment and retention were successful, and participants' evaluation of the training itself was positive but the influence on daily life was rated only moderately positive. In comparison with baseline at post-intervention participants showed significant improvements in general mindfulness, the burnout dimension personal accomplishment, quality of sleep, positive emotions, and self-efficacy. A significant decrease was found in the burnout dimension emotional exhaustion, stress level, negative emotions at work, and worrying. No significant changes were found for the burnout dimension mental distance, and work engagement. The measures showed ample within-person differences and low, medium, or high effect sizes. The current trial approach of the MBSR training seems feasible and acceptable. Our results suggest that mindfulness, burnout, stress level, quality of sleep, positive emotions at work, negative emotions at work, self-efficacy, and worrying are meaningful mental health variables for inclusion in a larger-scale Randomized Controlled Trial on the effects of MBSR.

TI  - A Novel Mindful-Compassion Art-Based Therapy for Reducing Burnout and Promoting Resilience Among Healthcare Workers: Findings From a Waitlist Randomized Control Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting the mental health of healthcare workers is an urgent global public health priority. Healthcare workers, especially those immersed in palliative care, are prone to burnout due to the intense emotions associated with end-of-life caregiving. This study examines the efficacy of a novel, multimodal, and group-based Mindful-Compassion Art-based Therapy (MCAT) that integrates reflective self-awareness with creative emotional expression for protecting healthcare workers' mental health. A dual-arm open-label waitlist randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 56 healthcare workers were recruited from the largest homecare hospice in Singapore and randomized to the immediate-treatment condition of a standardized 6-week, 18-hours MCAT intervention (n=29), or the waitlist-control condition (n=27). Self-administered outcome measures on burnout, resilience, emotional regulation, self-compassion, death attitudes, and quality of life were collected at baseline, post-intervention/second-baseline at 6weeks, and follow-up/post-intervention at 12weeks. Results from mixed model ANOVAs reveal that treatment group participants experienced significant reduction in mental exhaustion, as well as significant improvements in overall emotional regulation, nonreactivity to intrusive thoughts, approach acceptance of death, and afterlife belief as compared to waitlist-control immediately after MCAT completion. Effect sizes of these impacts ranged from medium to large (eta(2)=0.65 to 0.170). Results from one-way ANOVAs further reveal that the treatment gains of reduced mental exhaustion and increased emotional regulation were maintained among treatment group participants at 12-weeks follow-up compared to baseline, with new benefits identified. These include increased ability to observe and describe one's experiences, elevated overall self-compassion, greater mindful awareness, enhanced common humanity, and better quality of life. Effect sizes of these impacts were large (eta(2)=0.128 to 0.298). These findings reflect the robust effectiveness and positive residual effects of MCAT for reducing burnout, building resilience, nurturing compassion, fostering collegial support, and promoting mental wellness among healthcare workers. The clinical model and applicability of MCAT in larger and more diverse caregiving contexts, such as family dementia care, are discussed.

TI  - Mindfulness as a Potential Moderator Between Child Behavior Problems and Maternal Well-Being
T2  - AJIDD-AMERICAN JOURNAL ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based programs can help lower psychological distress among parents of children with developmental disabilities. However, less is known about the functions of mindfulness in relation to parental outcomes. In a cross-sectional survey, mothers of children with develop-mental disabilities (N 1/4 313) reported on their child's behavior problems, trait mindfulness, mindful parenting, and a range of outcomes (anxiety and depression symptoms, parenting stress, family satisfaction, and positive gain). Neither trait mindfulness or mindful parenting acted as moderators between child behavior problems and outcome variables, although both had main effect (compensatory) associations with parent outcomes. Benefits of mindfulness -based programs may be general rather than specifically in the context of high child behavior problems, given the lack of evidence for the moderating function of mindfulness.

TI  - Pilot Study of Videos to Deliver Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy for Adults With Multiple Sclerosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) has been shown to provide a strategy for adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) to self-manage their symptoms. There is a need for the use of an MBAT intervention that can be delivered in any setting for adults with MS. The purpose of this pilot feasibility study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of an MBAT intervention delivered via videoconference. METHODS: We developed an MBAT intervention to be delivered by videoconference to adults with MS recruited from an academic center registry. We also conducted phone interviews to collect acceptability data. RESULTS: Most of the participants (n = 5) were very positive about the MBAT video sessions and stated content as clear and easy to follow and understand. The time and delivering method were acceptable. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based art therapy sessions delivered through videoconference are acceptable and feasible for adults with MS.

TI  - Assessing the Acceptability of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Intervention for African-American Women Living with HIV/AIDS
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - African-American HIV-seropositive women are at elevated risk for depressive symptoms compared to their seropositive counterparts. Depressive symptoms have been linked to HIV/AIDS-related health predictors and outcomes such as medication and care adherence, and viral load. Project UPLIFT, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention originally designed for persons with epilepsy has been shown effective to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms. Focus groups were conducted to assess the appropriateness and acceptability of UPLIFT for African-American HIV-seropositive women and to obtain feedback on needed modifications. The focus groups, including cisgender and transgender African-American HIV-seropositive women, revealed, while well received, modifications should include lowering the reading level of content and altering specific mindfulness-based exercises to make them relevant and acceptable to the target population. This qualitative work demonstrates UPLIFT could be a promising avenue to improve the mental health of African-American HIV-seropositive women, a group for which mindfulness interventions had not been previously considered.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Colouring and Loving-Kindness Meditation: Exploring the Effectiveness of Non-Meditative and Meditative Practices on State Mindfulness and Anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF CREATIVITY IN MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation has been recognized as a valuable form of meditation practice and features in most mindfulness programs. The present research explored the potential of an alternative non-meditative loving-kindness practice; namely, loving-kindness coloring. University students (N= 180) were randomly assigned to the loving-kindness coloring condition or the meditation condition. Both loving-kindness meditation and loving-kindness coloring were explored by measuring state mindfulness, pre-, and post-intervention. Results indicated that both conditions similarly increased in-state mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreased state anxiety, while there were non-significant differences between the practices. We concluded that there are similar levels of effectiveness to loving kindness meditation when introducing loving kindness coloring. Future implications on the applicability of loving-kindness practices are discussed.

TI  - The pursuit of euthymia
T2  - WORLD PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychiatrists often consider the positive characteristics displayed by a patient in their clinical judgment, yet current assessment and treatment strategies are shifted on the side of psychological dysfunction. Euthymia is a transdiagnostic construct referring to the presence of positive affects and psychological well-being, i.e., balance and integration of psychic forces (flexibility), a unifying outlook on life which guides actions and feelings for shaping future accordingly (consistency), and resistance to stress (resilience and tolerance to anxiety or frustration). There is increasing evidence that the evaluation of euthymia and its components has major clinical implications. Specific instruments (clinical interviews and questionnaires) may be included in a clinimetric assessment strategy encompassing macro-analysis and staging. The pursuit of euthymia cannot be conceived as a therapeutic intervention for specific mental disorders, but as a transdiagnostic strategy to be incorporated in an individualized therapeutic plan. A number of psychotherapeutic techniques aiming to enhance positive affects and psychological well-being (such as well-being therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy) have been developed and validated in randomized controlled clinical trials. The findings indicate that flourishing and resilience can be promoted by specific interventions leading to a positive evaluation of one's self, a sense of continuing growth and development, the belief that life is purposeful and meaningful, satisfaction with one's relations with others, the capacity to manage effectively one's life, and a sense of self-determination.

TI  - Interventions to Reduce Stress and Burnout among Teachers: A Scoping Review.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Background: Teaching is recognized as a highly challenging profession. Experience of chronic stress is a risk factor for poor mental and physical well-being, and burnout. There is limited knowledge regarding optimal interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Objective: To undertake a scoping review of the literature in the last five years to determine various psychological interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Method: The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was followed. Relevant search terms were used to determine different interventions adopted to reduce teachers' stress and burnout. Articles published between 2018 and 2022 were identified using five bibliographic databases. Relevant articles were extracted, reviewed, collated, and thematically analyzed, and findings s were summarized. Results: Forty studies conducted in Asia, North America, Oceania, Europe, and Africa, met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen kinds of burnout and stress-reduction interventions were identified. The most popularly studied intervention were Mindfulness-Based Interventions alone or in combination with yoga or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), followed by Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT). Mindfulness-Based Interventions led to decreased overall Teacher Stress Inventory (TSI) and emotional exhaustion subscale scores. REBT, primarily used with special education teachers, especially in Africa, has also shown positive results. Other interventions reporting positive outcomes include Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR), the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program (SMART), Cyclic Meditation, Group Sandplay, Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Autogenic Training, Sport-Based Physical Activity, Emotional Intelligence Ability Models and Christian Prayer and Prayer-Reflection. Conclusions: Stress and burnout can have a negative impact on teachers and, very often, on the students they teach. Implementing suitable school-based interventions is necessary to improve teachers' stress-coping ability, reduce the likelihood of burnout and improve general well-being. Policymakers, governments, school boards and administrators should prioritize the implementation of school-based awareness and intervention programs.

TI  - The effects of amount of home meditation practice in Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy on hazard of relapse to depression in the Staying Well after Depression Trial
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Few empirical studies have explored the associations between formal and informal mindfulness home practice and outcome in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). In this study ninety-nine participants randomised to MBCT in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial completed self-reported ratings of home practice over 7 treatment weeks. Recurrence of Major Depression was assessed immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months post-treatment. Results identified a significant association between mean daily duration of formal home practice and outcome and additionally indicated that participants who reported that they engaged in formal home practice on at least 3 days a week during the treatment phase were almost half as likely to relapse as those who reported fewer days of formal practice. These associations were independent of the potentially confounding variable of participant-rated treatment plausibility. The current study identified no significant association between informal home practice and outcome, although this may relate to the inherent difficulties in quantifying informal home mindfulness practice. These findings have important implications for clinicians discussing mindfulness-based interventions with their participants, in particular in relation to MBCT, where the amount of participant engagement in home practice appears to have a significant positive impact on outcome.

TI  - Comparing impacts of meditation training in focused attention, open monitoring, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on emotion reactivity and regulation: Neural and subjective evidence from a dismantling study
T2  - PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Commonly conducted mindfulness-based trainings such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) highlight training in two key forms of meditation: focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM). Largely unknown is what each of these mindfulness practices contributes to emotional and other important training outcomes. This dismantling trial compared the effects of structurally equivalent trainings in MBCT, FA, and OM on neural and subjective markers of emotional reactivity and regulation among community adults, with the aim to better understand which forms of training represent active ingredients in mindfulness trainings. Participants with varying levels of depressive symptoms were randomized to one of the three trainings. Before and after each 8-week training, N = 89 participants completed a modified version of the Emotional Reactivity and Regulation Task while electroencephalographic (EEG) and self-reported emotional responses to negative, positive, and neutral photographic images were collected. Examination of EEG-based frontal alpha band asymmetry during passive viewing (reactivity) and active regulation phases of the task showed that FA and MBCT trainings produced significant leftward hemispheric shifts in frontal alpha asymmetry, commonly associated with a shift toward approach-based positive affect. Self-reported emotional responses to negative images corroborated these results, suggesting salutary changes in both emotional reactivity and regulation. OM training had limited beneficial effects, restricted to the subjective outcomes. The findings suggest that MBCT may derive its greatest benefit from training in FA rather than OM. Discussion highlights the potential value of FA training for emotional health.

TI  - Effects of Quality Practice on a Compassion Cultivation Training: Somatic and Imagery Levels of Analysis
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Compassion-based interventions (CBIs) are effective in promoting mental health. However, the mechanisms through which CBIs produce these positive outcomes are not fully known. The amount of meditation practice in CBIs has been associated with the outcomes but the role of quality of practice has not yet been explored. Thus, in addition to examining the contribution of the Compassion Practice Quality Scale (CPQS) to predicting the main outcomes of a CBI (compassion cultivation training), the current study explored the scale's construct validity and sensitivity to change.Methods Data were drawn from a pretest-posttest study design (n = 74), and compassion practice quality, positive self-compassion, negative self-compassion, difficulties in emotion regulation, and body awareness were assessed.Results The CPQS was found to be a valid and reliable measure, showing pretest-posttest differences. Overall, CPQS baseline scores were positively associated with positive self-compassion and body awareness and negatively associated with negative self-compassion and difficulties in emotion regulation. Moreover, compassion practice quality explained a significant amount of variance in positive self-compassion (Delta R2 = .18, Delta F (4, 31) = 2.69, p = .049), after controlling for baseline positive self-compassion, previous meditation experience, and frequency of formal practice during the CBI.Conclusions The findings confirm the significance of compassion practice quality and the usefulness of the CPQS in compassion research. Future studies should continue to investigate the psychometric properties of the CPQS, describing the daily or weekly evolution of compassion practice and developing specific pedagogical strategies to foster compassion practice quality within CBIs.

TI  - Is learning mindfulness associated with improved affect after mindfulness-based cognitive therapy?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased popularity of mindfulness-based interventions and the growing body of empirical evidence confirming the positive effects of these interventions on well-being warrant more research to determine if the effects are indeed related to learning mindfulness. The present study extends previous studies, by examining whether and how changes in five core aspects of mindfulness are related to changes in the report of negative and positive affect during an 8-week course of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. The study was performed in 64 individuals from the community with mild to moderate psychological problems. Data were collected by self-report questionnaires before and directly after the training. Results showed significant decreases in negative affect and increases in positive affect. We also found significant increases in four of the five aspects of mindfulness. Importantly, changes in mindfulness were significantly associated with improved affect, with a distinct pattern found for positive and negative affect. Hereby, our findings extend previous research by showing that learning distinct aspects of mindfulness is differently related to an improved positive affect and a decreased negative affect. Future randomized controlled trials with a larger sample and longer follow-up period are needed to replicate these findings.

TI  - How do mindfulness-based interventions promote coping and self-efficacy in patients with cancer: A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative data
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to review the existing quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding how mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) help cope with cancer-related challenges and increase affected patients' perceived self-efficacy.MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, PsycInfo, PubPsych, and CINAHL. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies were included if they (1) evaluated MBIs (2) for patients with cancer or cancer survivors (3) regarding their impact on coping with cancer and perceived self-efficacy. The reports were screened by two independent reviewers and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. The review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022368765).ResultsFindings from 28 reports of 19 quantitative studies, six qualitative studies, and three mixed-methods studies (total N = 1722) were extracted and integrated. The synthesis of quantitative data showed considerable heterogeneity in outcomes and measurement instruments. Most often reported were significant positive impacts of mindfulness on general coping skills, self-regulation, and perceived efficacy in coping with cancer. Qualitative interviews with patients supported those results. The three meta-themes identified were that MBI (1) provided patients with tools to use in stressful situations, (2) promoted a general change of mindset and (3) created a feeling of social connectedness.ConclusionsThe reviewed studies suggest that MBI can promote coping and enhance the perceived self-efficacy of patients with cancer. In the future, more research investigating the different aspects of coping and the potentially moderating role of self-efficacy could provide further insights with respect to how coping and self-efficacy related to MBI.

TI  - Mindfulness-based and cognitive-based stress prevention in student teachers (<i>startklar</i>): study protocol of a randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Teachers and student teachers in Germany are a high-risk population for stress and stress-related mental health problems. This often leads to early retirement in subsequent professional life. Various trials have demonstrated positive effects of stress prevention training on the perceived stress and stress-related symptoms of teachers. Although many studies show positive effects of mindfulness-based stress interventions, there is not yet any mindfulness-based intervention for teachers or student teachers in Germany. The aim of this trial is to evaluate a training that combines mindfulness-based and cognitive interventions into one programme, addressing to the specific burdens of student teachers.Methods and analysis This study protocol presents a prospective block-randomised controlled trial. Assessment will take place at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up) for an intervention and waiting control group, and at a fourth assessment point for the waiting control group after receiving the training. The aim is to evaluate the effects of mindfulness-based stress prevention on stress, psychological morbidity, burnout and self-efficacy using validated measures. Participants are student teachers from German teacher training colleges and participation will be voluntary. The targeted total sample size is 96 at 3-month follow-up. The training will comprise three 4-hour sessions conducted every 2 weeks. The control group will participate in the training after the 3-month follow-up. The allotment will be randomised with a stratified allocation ratio by gender. After descriptive statistics have been evaluated, inferential statistical analysis will be conducted using repeated measures analysis of variance with interactions between time and group. Effect sizes will be calculated using partial eta(2) values.Ethics and dissemination Results will be disseminated at conferences, in specialist magazines and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial has been approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.192.16 (10511).

TI  - Reducing Distress in Mothers of Children With Autism and Other Disabilities: A Randomized Trial
T2  - PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with other parents, mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disabilities experience more stress, illness, and psychiatric problems. Although the cumulative stress and disease burden of these mothers is exceptionally high, and associated with poorer outcomes in children, policies and practices primarily serve the identified child with disabilities.METHODS: A total of 243 mothers of children with disabilities were consented and randomized into either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (mindfulness practice) or Positive Adult Development (positive psychology practice). Well-trained, supervised peer mentors led 6 weeks of group treatments in 1.5-hour weekly sessions, assessing mothers 6 times before, during, and up to 6 months after treatment. Mothers had children with autism (65%) or other disabilities (35%). At baseline, 85% of this community sample had significantly elevated stress, 48% were clinically depressed, and 41% had anxiety disorders.RESULTS: Using slopes-as-outcomes, mixed random effects models, both treatments led to significant reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety, and improved sleep and life satisfaction, with large effects in depression and anxiety. Mothers in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction versus Positive Adult Development had greater improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep, and well-being. Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder improved less in anxiety, but did not otherwise differ from their counterparts.CONCLUSIONS: Future studies are warranted on how trained mentors and professionals can address the unmet mental health needs of mothers of children with developmental disabilities. Doing so improves maternal wellbeing and furthers their long-term caregiving of children with complex developmental, physical, and behavioral needs.

TI  - A pilot RCT of an online mindfulness-based cognitive intervention for chemsex
T2  - COUNSELLING & PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Chemsex is a term used to describe sex acts using psychoactive substances to enhance the sexual experience/arousal and predominates among men who have sex with men (MSM). Chemsex drugs predominantly include gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and analogues, methamphetamine, mephedrone and erectile dysfunction agents (e.g., Sildenafil). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) combines cognitive therapy and mindfulness and has been shown to help support both sexual functioning and methamphetamine use. However, limited clinical trials have evaluated the use of cognitive mindfulness for chemsex in MSM. The present study assessed the effectiveness of an online mindfulness-based cognitive intervention (MBCI) among 29 MSM aged 18-30 years engaged in chemsex.Design and Setting: A mixed methods approach consisted of a randomised waitlist-controlled trial and a content analysis reviewing participants' feedback on MBCI. The design of the intervention was based on a behavioural taxonomy mapped to selected behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to support the reliability of MBCI in its delivery.Main Outcome MeasuresParticipants completed assessments measuring levels of chemsex, mindfulness, sexual self-efficacy and well-being, taken at Weeks 0, 8 and 12 (follow-up).Results: Participants reported lower levels of chemsex and higher levels of cognitive mindfulness, sexual self-efficacy and well-being postintervention and at the 12-week follow-up. The content analysis feedback responses yielded favourable outcomes, suggesting that participants developed a sense of self-compassion, confidence and positive identity.Conclusions: The MBCI effectively reduced chemsex; however, this study warrants replication with a larger, more diverse group of participants.

TI  - Predicting which intervention works better for whom: Moderators of treatment effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and Positive Psychology Intervention in patients with bipolar disorder
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to identify moderators of treatment effect (i.e. depressive symptoms and wellbeing) of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI) in patients with bipolar disorder. Methods: Data were drawn from two multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating effectiveness of MBCT vs treatment as usual (TAU; n = 144) and PPI vs TAU (n = 97) in bipolar disorder. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 12 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using separate linear regression models, comparing the pooled MBCT or PPI outcomes to TAU, and comparing MBCT to PPI. Results: The exploratory analyses not corrected for multiple comparisons showed a number of variables that were associated with stronger response to the interventions, including higher baseline anxiety, lower well-being, and lower levels of self-focused positive rumination, well-being, and self-compassion, and variables associated with a stronger response to either MBCT (higher levels of depression and anxiety and being married) or PPI (being male). After correcting for multiple testing, depressive symptoms appeared to be the most robust variable associated with better response to MBCT than PPI. Limitations: The RCTs handled slightly different enrollment criteria and outcome measures. Conclusions: The most robust finding is that patients with more severe symptomatology seem to benefit more from MBCT than PPI. Clinical implications: This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. However, before definite treatment assignment criteria can be formulated and implemented in clinical practice, these findings should be replicated.

TI  - A resilience intervention involving mindfulness training for transplant patients and their caregivers
T2  - CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Solid organ and stem cell transplant patients and their caregivers report a substantial level of distress. Mindfulness-based stress reduction has been shown to alleviate distress associated with transplant, but there is limited experience in this population with other mindfulness-based interventions, or with combined transplant patient and caregiver interventions. We evaluated a novel, 6-week mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT) class for transplant patients and their caregivers that incorporates mindfulness practice, yoga, and neuroscience of stress and resilience. Thirty-one heart, liver, kidney/pancreas, and stem cell transplant patients and 18 caregivers at Mayo Clinic in Arizona participated. Measures of stress, resilience, depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, positive and negative affect, and sleep were completed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months postintervention. At 6 weeks and 3 months, patients demonstrated significant (P<.005) improvements from baseline in measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Quality-of-life mental component (P=.006) and positive affect (P=.02) also improved at follow-up. Most participants adhered to the program, were satisfied with class length and frequency, and reported improved well-being as a result of the class. MBRT holds promise as an intervention to enhance resilience and manage stress for transplant patients and their caregivers.

TI  - Effects of Web-Based Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Anxiety, Depression, and Stress Among Frontline Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Since 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has spread around the world, and health care workers, as frontline workers, have faced tremendous psychological stress.Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore whether web-based mindfulness-based interventions continue to have a positive impact on anxiety, depression, and stress among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) participants were frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the experimental group was a web-based mindfulness-based intervention; (3) the control group used either general psychological intervention or no intervention; (4) outcome indicators included scales to assess anxiety, depression, and stress; and (5) the study type was a randomized controlled study. Studies that did not meet the above requirements were excluded. We searched 9 databases, including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, for randomized controlled studies on the effects of web-based mindfulness-based interventions on common mental disorder symptoms among health care workers from January 1, 2020, to October 20, 2022. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Subgroup analysis was used to look for sources of heterogeneity and to explore whether the results were the same for subgroups under different conditions. Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the stability of the pooled results.Results: A total of 10 randomized controlled studies with 1311 participants were included. The results showed that web-based mindfulness-based interventions were effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety (standard mean difference [SMD]=-0.63, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.31, P<.001, I-2=87%), depression (SMD=-0.52, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.26, P<.001, I-2=75%), and stress (SMD=-0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05, P=.01, I-2=58%) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with wide CIs and high heterogeneity.Conclusions: Web-based mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress among frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this effect is relatively mild and needs to be further explored by better studies in the future.

TI  - Cultivating a way of being and doing: Individual strategies for physician well-being and resilience
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of medicine is rewarding on many levels, but demands of the work can result in mental and emotional exhaustion, self-isolation, burnout, depression, suicidal ideation and tragically, completed suicide. It is critical to have effective strategies to address the unique stressors of a medical career, mitigate burnout, and buffer the physiologic toll of chronic stress. Using Zwack and Schweitzer's widely published description of approaches to maintaining resilience and approaches to wellness, we have organized these strategies into three broad domains relevant to medical practice: (1) gratification (connection and communication, meaning and purpose); (2) resilience building practices (self-reflection, time for oneself, self-compassion, spirituality); and (3) useful attitudes (acceptance, flexibility, self-awareness). Several techniques are described including mindfulness-based stress reduction, narrative medicine, skillful communication, and practices in self-compassion, gratitude, and spirituality. The focus of the work is to introduce a spectrum of resilience strategies for individual consideration that can be tailored and combined to meet a physician's changing needs over the course of medical training and practice.

TI  - The efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction on mental health of breast cancer patients: a meta-analysis
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This study aims to investigate the evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in improving stress, depression and anxiety in breast cancer patients.Methods: An extensive systematic electronic review (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsyArticles, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library) and a hand search were carried out from 15 October 2011 to 30 November 2011 to retrieve relevant articles using mindfulness' or mindfulness-based stress reduction' and breast cancer' as keywords. Information about the baseline characteristics of the participants, interventions and findings on perceived stress, depression and anxiety was extracted from each study.Results: Nine published studies (two randomised controlled trials, one quasi-experimental case-control study and six one-group, pre-intervention and post-intervention studies) up to November 2011 that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were analysed. The pooled effect size (95% CI) for MBSR on stress was 0.710 (0.511-0.909), on depression was 0.575 (0.429-0.722) and on anxiety was 0.733 (0.450-1.017).Conclusion: On the basis of these findings, MBSR shows a moderate to large positive effect size on the mental health of breast cancer patients and warrants further systematic investigation because it has a potential to make a significant improvement on mental health for women in this group.

TI  - How Might Mindfulness-Based Interventions Reduce Job Burnout? Testing a Potential Self-regulation Model with a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Previous studies have supported the idea that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could reduce burnout but lack theory-based explorations of the underlying mechanisms. The integrative view of job demands-resources theory and self-regulation suggests that self-regulation is crucial for coping with job burnout. Based on this theoretical point of view, the present research investigated the effect of MBIs on burnout and the potential mediation between burnout and specific self-regulation traits, including mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-control.Methods Study 1 (N = 342; 19.9% managers and 19.9% technologists) collected cross-sectional data utilizing network analysis to explore the complex relations between self-regulation and burnout. Study 2 (N = 156; 30.8% teachers) conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) on burnout and the mediating role of the three self-regulation components.Results (1) Self-compassion was more related to initiatory than inhibitory self-control; (2) acting with awareness, self-compassion, and inhibitory and initiatory self-control played important roles in the self-regulation and burnout network; (3) MBPP could significantly improve mindfulness, self-control, and self-compassion while protecting against burnout; and (4) acting with awareness mediated the effect of inhibitory self-control on depersonalization.Conclusions MBPP has the potential to protect against burnout. Self-regulation mediated the intervention effect on burnout, which supported the integrative view on burnout in MBIs. The findings also supported the necessity to differentiate subcomponents of self-compassion and self-control and suggested a new mechanism by which self-control could benefit the application of mindfulness.

TI  - A Qualitative Analysis of the Impact of Preoperative Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Total Knee Arthroplasty Surgical Experiences
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We qualitatively explored the impact of preoperative mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) experiences. Participants ( n = 10) who received MBSR prior to TKA participated in semi-structured interviews concerning their experiences with MBSR and its perceived impact on surgery. We analyzed interviews according to reflexive thematic analysis, and coded data into three main themes: 1) Impact of MBSR on surgery experiences; 2) Contributors to change; and 3) Motivations for participation. Participants noted they were able to relax, feel more confident, and cope more effectively during the preoperative period, and that others in their lives noticed positive changes following their participation in MBSR. Participants' openness to mindfulness and health-related beliefs and may have contributed to the positive impacts they experienced from MBSR. Participants described being motivated to participate in MBSR to help them prepare for their surgery and to learn new coping strategies. Participants described a strong level of commitment to the intervention. With further research, integration of MBSR into prehabilitation for TKA may be appropriate.

TI  - A feasibility and acceptability study of an adaptation of the Mindful Self-Compassion program for adult cancer patients
T2  - PALLIATIVE & SUPPORTIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Psychosocial interventions that mitigate psychosocial distress in cancer patients are important. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an adaptation of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program among adult cancer patients. A secondary aim was to examine pre-post-program changes in psychosocial wellbeing. Method The research design was a feasibility and acceptability study, with an examination of pre- to post-intervention changes in psychosocial measures. A study information pack was posted to 173 adult cancer patients 6 months-5 years post-diagnosis, with an invitation to attend an eight-week group-based adaptation of the MSC program. Results Thirty-two (19%) consented to the program, with 30 commencing. Twenty-seven completed the program (mean age: 62.93 years, SD 14.04; 17 [63%] female), attending a mean 6.93 (SD 1.11) group sessions. There were no significant differences in medico-demographic factors between program-completers and those who did not consent. However, there was a trend toward shorter time since diagnosis in the program-completers group. Program-completers rated the program highly regarding content, relevance to the concerns of cancer patients, and the likelihood of recommending the program to other cancer patients. Sixty-three percent perceived that their mental wellbeing had improved from pre- to post-program; none perceived a deterioration in mental wellbeing. Small-to-medium effects were observed for depressive symptoms, fear of cancer recurrence, stress, loneliness, body image satisfaction, mindfulness, and self-compassion.Significance of results. The MSC program appears feasible and acceptable to adults diagnosed with non-advanced cancer. The preliminary estimates of effect sizes in this sample suggest that participation in the program was associated with improvements in psychosocial wellbeing. Collectively, these findings suggest that there may be value in conducting an adequately powered randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the MSC program in enhancing the psychosocial wellbeing of cancer patients.

TI  - Hyped-up or meditate: A scoping review of mindfulness-based group interventions for adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
T2  - CLINICAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this scoping review is to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness training in improving functioning in adolescents (aged 12-19 years) diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Previous research has demonstrated that psychological interventions improve functioning in a myriad of domains for individuals diagnosed with ADHD, such as attention training, interpersonal relationships, and social skills. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) are indicated as an intervention in attention training. It maybe argued that group based MBI programmes should begin early, for children and adolescents at a time that is critical in their development. Methods and reporting are in line with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews, the protocol is preregistered in the (Open Science Framework register). The study outcomes included attention, impulsivity, and relationships of adolescents with ADHD. Findings demonstrated preliminary evidence for the use of group-based mindfulness interventions with adolescents continues to be nascent. Although studies reported positive results, the evidence of its effectiveness for adolescents with ADHD is inconclusive, due to limited studies available and the limitations of the study design. This scoping review provides a panorama of MBI for ADHD adolescents.This review explores group mindfulness-based programmes for adolescents with attention deficit hyperactive disorders. It provides a useful summary for clinicians.

T2  - Journal of gerontological social work
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - An 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group for older adults with depression and/or anxiety is described. This article is based on an exploratory study of this therapeutic approach and changes in participants' symptoms associated with participation. Pre-post data from 5 MBCT groups showed significant improvements in reported anxiety, ruminative thoughts, and sleep problems and a reduction in depressive symptoms. Case examples are presented to illustrate these symptom changes. Findings showed that this nonpharmacological intervention is acceptable to older adults and is associated with positive changes. Suggestions are provided for both practitioners and researchers interested in using MBCT with older adults.

TI  - Acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions for persons with psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches have gained popularity in recent years.Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of acceptance- and mindfulness-based therapies for persons with a psychotic or schizophrenia spectrum disorder.Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant databases were searched for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to October 2018. Outcomes were severity of overall symptomatology, hospitalization, positive and negative symptoms, depression, anxiety, social functioning, quality of life, acceptance, mindfulness skills and safety of the interventions.Results: Sixteen studies comprising 1268 people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were included in the meta-analyses. Moderate to large effect sizes were found for overall symptomatology and hospitalization at endpoint (SMD .80,95% CI -1.31, -029 and MD 4.38, -5.58, -3.17 respectively) and follow-up (SMD 1.10, -2.09, -0.10 and MD 7.18, -8.67, - 5.68 respectively). There were significant small effects on negative symptoms (SMD .24; -0.44, -0.03), small to moderate effects for depression (SMD .47; -0.80, -0.14), social functioning (SMD .43; -0.75,-0.12) and mindfulness (SMD .51; -0.97, -0.05), moderate to large effects for acceptance (SMD .78; -1.44, -0.12), while no significant effects for positive symptoms (SMD .27; -0.65,0.00), anxiety (SMD 2.11; -4.64,0.42) or quality of life (SMD .43; -0.88,0.02). Majority of studies (75%) had low risk of bias and sensitivity analyses supported the findings.Conclusion: Acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches appear to be effective and safe interventions for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and could be a useful extension of standard casemanagement and psychofarmacology.

TI  - The Process of Change of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for People with Bipolar Disorder: a Qualitative Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychological treatment that might be beneficial for people with bipolar disorder (BD). Neurocognitive studies suggest that MBCT may have important effects on mood regulation and broad attentional and frontal-executive control in BD. In this qualitative study, the process of change of MBCT in people with BD is explored.Methods The current qualitative study was part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT for BD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 16 participants who participated in an 8-week MBCT. For reasons of triangulation, teachers were interviewed as well.Results Three themes arose from the data: (1) awareness of thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations, and behavior and insight into their inter-relationship; (2) behavioral change; and (3) positive consequences following MBCT. A distinction was made between general aspects and aspects related specifically to BD. Themes were divided into subthemes. Process of change took place in a non-linear, iterative fashion.Conclusions: Qualitative data support the notion that several cognitive and behavioral processes in BD could be potential targets for MBCT. We suggest that future mediation, neuroimaging, and cognitive experimental studies should explore MBCT as an adjunctive treatment strategy for BD by investigating possible working mechanisms of MBCT in BD.

T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: and purpose: Women's health behaviours during pregnancy can affect their children's lifetime outcomes. Inactivity, poor diet, alcohol, and smoking during pregnancy are linked to maternal stress and distress. Mindfulness-based interventions can improve health behaviours and mental health. The purpose of the study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness-based maternal behaviour change intervention. Materials and methods: The eight-week 'Mind the Bump' intervention integrated mindfulness training with behaviour change techniques. It aimed to improve mindfulness, mental health, and adherence to UK maternal health behaviour guidance. Acceptability, practicability, effectiveness/cost-effectiveness, affordability, safety/side-effects, and equity were evaluated from baseline to post-course and follow-up. Results: Mindfulness, positive affect, and wellbeing improved. Stress, negative affect, depression, anxiety, and adherence to guidance did not improve. The intervention was practicable and safe, but the other implementability criteria were not satisfied. Conclusion: The intervention was not fully feasible; recommendations to address its limitations are discussed.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PROBLEM: The purpose of this study was to reduce perceived levels of interprofessional staff stress and to improve patient and staff safety by implementing a brief mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training program on a high-acuity psychiatric inpatient unit.METHODS: A one-group repeated measure design was utilized to measure the impact of the (MBSR) training program on staff stress and safety immediately post-training and at 2 months. Two instruments were utilized in the study: the Toronto Mindfulness Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale.FINDINGS: The MBSR program reduced staff stress across the 2-month post-training period and increased staff mindfulness immediately following the brief training period of 8 days, and across the 2-month post-training period. A trend toward positive impact on patient and staff safety was also seen in a decreased number of staff call-ins, decreased need for 1:1 staffing episodes, and decreased restraint use 2 months following the training period.CONCLUSIONS: A brief MBSR training program offered to an interprofessional staff of a high-acuity inpatient adolescent psychiatric unit was effective in decreasing their stress, increasing their mindfulness, and improving staff and patient safety.

TI  - Mindfulness-based practices with family carers of adults with learning disability and behaviour that challenges in the UK: Participatory health research
T2  - HEALTH EXPECTATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Family carers of adults with learning disability and behaviours that challenge lead complex and stressful lives. Their caring role can leave them isolated and unsupported. In the UK, effective services designed to build resilience for people in long-term caring roles are lacking. There are none (to our knowledge) designed using a participatory health research (PHR) approach with family carers and professionals. Objective With positive behaviour support (PBS) and mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as key elements, a PHR approach was used to understand the basis for a successful course that supported the capabilities and resilience of family members in long-term caring roles. Design The research was guided by the principles of PHR with participation as the defining principle throughout. Central to the research were reflexive conversations (communicative spaces) where diverse knowledges were shared and critiqued. Findings Mindfulness/ACT can change long-standing response behaviours and build personal resilience and improve mental health. Elements enabling positive change included a facilitation approach for collaborative reflexivity and the complementary, interactive approach to collaborative enquiry for learning and decision making afforded by PHR. Discussion The use of PHR accessed knowledges that would have been lost to more traditional, professional-expert driven processes and facilitated change in constructs for action for both professionals and family carers. Findings challenge service providers to consider how experiential knowledge has agency in professional practice and service design. Reflection on the PHR process across the FaBPos project led to a re-consideration of quality issues in relation to PHR and participation.

However, information on the level of SI among COVID-19 survivors in China is still limited. Aim To assess the prevalence and risk factors of SI among COVID-19 survivors in Wuhan, China. Design The cross-sectional study was carried out among former COVID-19 patients in Jianghan District (Wuhan, China) from June 10 to July 25, 2021. Methods SI, fatigue, stigma, sleep disorder, resilience, peace of mind, and social support of the participants were measured by the SI-related item, Fatigue Scale (FS-14), short version of COVID-19 Stigma Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), The Peace of Mind Scale (PoM), The Resilience Style Questionnaire (RSQ) and two single separate items for measuring social support. Logistic regression was utilized to identify associated factors of SI. Mediation analysis was performed to assess the potential mechanisms between psychological factors and SI. Results A total of 1,297 participants were included in this study. 6.7% of them reported SI. Marriage (AOR = 0.389, P = 0.003) and peace of mind (AOR = 0.854, P < 0.001) were negatively associated with SI. History of psychological or emotional counseling before COVID-19 infection (AOR = 1.889, P = 0.049), fatigue (AOR = 1.110, P = 0.007), higher self-reported COVID-19 related stigma (AOR = 1.054, P = 0.003) and sleep disorder (AOR = 1.112, P = 0.001) were positively associated with SI. Conclusions Consideration should be taken into account to develop appropriate alleviating measures such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to reduce the rates of SI among COVID-19 survivors and improve their resilience to cope with the personal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Ontological addiction theory: Attachment to me, mine, and I
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL ADDICTIONS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Background: Ontological addiction theory (OAT) is a novel metaphysical model of psychopathology and posits that human beings are prone to forming implausible beliefs concerning the way they think they exist, and that these beliefs can become addictive leading to functional impairments and mental illness. The theoretical underpinnings of OAT derive from the Buddhist philosophical perspective that all phenomena, including the self, do not manifest inherently or independently. Aims and methods: This paper outlines the theoretical foundations of OAT along with indicative supportive empirical evidence from studies evaluating meditation awareness training as well as studies investigating non-attachment, emptiness, compassion, and loving-kindness. Results: OAT provides a novel perspective on addiction, the factors that underlie mental illness, and how beliefs concerning selfhood are shaped and reified. Conclusion: In addition to continuing to test the underlying assumptions of OAT, future empirical research needs to determine how ontological addiction fits with extant theories of self, reality, and suffering, as well with more established models of addiction.

TI  - Mindfulness-based strengths practice: a conceptual framework and empirical review of the literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This review set out to provide empirical literature on mindfulness-based strengths practice (MBSP), a new approach in positive psychology that integrates mindfulness with character strengths, two positive predictors of well-being. First, the conceptualization of integrating character strengths and mindfulness into MBSP is discussed. The literature on the interrelatedness of character strengths and mindfulness is then described, along with ways that the intervention of MBSP encourages positive outcomes at various levels. The literature search returned 7 (10 samples, N = 3,851) studies supporting a positive association between character strengths and mindfulness (r = 0.3-0.4) and the mediating role of character strengths/virtues in mindfulness and mindfulness's role in enhancing character strengths toward psychological well-being. The nine MBSP intervention studies (9 samples, N = 354) conducted in diverse contexts provide evidence of a significant improvement in well-being, engagement, life satisfaction, mindfulness, positive affect, character strengths, work-related outcomes, heightened birthing parents' well-being during pregnancy and childbirth, increased academic performance, and enhanced mental health among students. The intervention studies also reported the fostering of mindful positive parenting and contributions to a significant reduction in negative psychological states, such as stress, depression, anxiety, and negative affect. This comprehensive review provides empirical support for the MBSP framework and its positive impact on well-being across various domains, including organizations, education, healthcare, and family. However, it underscores the need for more extensive research, as the current literature on MBSP is limited. The review encourages future studies to explore MBSP applications in diverse domains, thereby paving the way for a deeper understanding of its potential benefits.

TI  - Examining the effects of mindfulness-based yoga instruction on positive embodiment and affective responses
T2  - EATING DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical evidence provides support for the inclusion of yoga as part of eating disorder prevention efforts through its positive impact on positive embodiment and experience of positive core affect. However, there is a need to identify the specific instructional strategies that will more consistently support positive embodiment and positive affect. We examined the effect of teaching a single yoga class using mindfulness-based instruction compared to appearance-based and neutral instruction alternatives on embodiment (i.e., state body surveillance, state body appreciation, pleasure during yoga) and changes in affect from before to after class. Female participants (N = 62; M-age = 23.89, SD = 6.86) were randomly assigned to a yoga class that emphasized: being mindfully present in one's body, changing one's appearance, or just getting into yoga poses. ANOVAs revealed significantly higher body surveillance (eta(2)(p) =.10) and lower forecasted pleasure (eta(2)(p) =.21) in the appearance class compared to the other two classes. Participants in the mindfulness class experienced greater improvement in affect (eta(2)(p) =.08) from before to after class and higher remembered pleasure during the yoga class (eta(2)(p) =.19) compared to those in the appearance class. Emphasizing changes to appearance in yoga instruction may place participants at risk for less positive affect and less positive experiences of embodiment compared to mindfulness-based or even neutral yoga instruction.

TI  - Does Mindfulness Practice Promote Psychological Functioning or Is It the Other Way Around? A Daily Diary Study
T2  - PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions are commonly used to reduce psychological symptoms and enhance positive qualities of human functioning. However, the influence of mindfulness practice dosage remains poorly understood, limiting dissemination and implementation efforts. The current study examined the association between practice dosage and several constructs related to psychological functioning (positive and negative affect, state mindfulness) over the course of a standardized mindfulness-based intervention (Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement). Twenty-live participants completed daily diary assessments for 12 weeks. Two-part gamma regression models examined the dichotomous (did practice occur?) and continuous (how much practice?) components of practice minutes. Practice time and outcomes showed same-day relationships in the expected directions. Lagged models, however, showed no evidence that current day practice time predicts subsequent day outcomes. In contrast, higher current day negative affect predicted less subsequent day practice time. and higher current day mindfulness predicted more subsequent day practice time. In a post hoc analysis, practice time moderated the link between day-to-day affect, strengthening the link for positive affect and weakening the link for negative affect. Collectively, these findings suggest that the causal direction linking practice time and outcome may flow from outcome to practice time, rather than the reverse-with potential recursive relationships between these factors. Further examination of lagged relationships between practice time and outcome as well as random assignment of participants to varying practice dosages (e.g., in within-person microrandomized trials) may help clarify the influence of this central treatment ingredient within mindfulness-based interventions.

T2  - SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute psychiatric nurses experience workplace stressors related to organizational factors including staffing shortages, along with interpersonal conflict with patients and colleagues. The pilot study examined the experience of burnout among acute care psychiatric nurses and the usefulness of a social work lead mindfulness-based intervention for reducing burnout elements. Findings indicated participants experienced emotional exhaustion associated with their work, but also a significant degree of personal accomplishment. Nurses identified the intervention as having the potential to promote better emotional regulation in the workplace and beyond. Social worker education on mindfulness techniques may represent an untapped resource for improving the emotional wellness and effective patient care.

TI  - Mindfulness Meditation for Primary Headache Pain: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Several studies have reported that mindfulness meditation has a potential effect in controlling headaches, such as migraine and tension-type headache; however, its role remains controversial. This review assessed the evidence regarding the effects of mindfulness meditation for primary headache pain.Methods: Only English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [the Cochrane Library], PsycINFO, Psychology and behavioral science collection, PsyArticles, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched from their inception to November 2016 with the keywords ("meditation" or "mindfulness" or "vipassana" or "dzogchen" or "zen" or "integrative body-mind training" or "IBMT" or "mindfulness-based stress reduction" or "MBSR" or "mindfulness-based cognitive therapy" or "MBCT" and "Headache" or "Head pain" or "Cephalodynia" or "Cephalalgia" or "Hemicrania" or "Migraine"). Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened against study inclusion criteria: controlled trials of structured meditation programs for adult patients with primary headache pain. The quality of studies included in the meta-analysis was assessed with the Yates Quality Rating Scale. The meta-analysis was conducted with Revman 5.3.Results: Ten randomized controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial with a combined study population of 315 patients were included in the study. When compared to control group data, mindfulness meditation induced significant improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference, -0.89; 95% confidence interval, -1.63 to -0.15; P = 0.02) and headache frequency (-0.67; -1.24 to -0.10; P = 0.02). In a subgroup analysis of different meditation forms, mindfulness-based stress reduction displayed a significant positive influence on pain intensity (P < 0.000). Moreover, 8-week intervention had a significant positive effect (P < 0.000).Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation may reduce pain intensity and is a promising treatment option for patients. Clinicians may consider mindfulness meditation as a viable complementary and alternative medical option for primary headache.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for body dysmorphic disorder: Impact on core symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and executive functioning
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is garnering increasing empirical interest as an intervention for Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), although no studies of mindfulness as a standalone treatment have included a sample composed entirely of patients with BDD or a comparison group. The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement of MBCT intervention on the core symptoms, emotional dysfunction, and executive function of BDD patients, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training. Method: Patients with BDD were randomized into an 8-week MBCT group (n = 58) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group (n = 58) and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Participants who received MBCT showed greater improvement on self-reported and clinician ratings of BDD symptoms, self-reported emotion dysregulation symptoms and executive function compared with TAU participants. Improvement for executive function tasks was partially supported. In addition, feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training were positive. Limitations: There is no systematic assessment of the severity of key potential outcome variables associated with BDD. Conclusion: MBCT may be a useful intervention for patients with BDD, improving patients' BDD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and executive functioning.

TI  - Incorporating Ethics Into Brief Mindfulness Practice: Effects on Well-Being and Prosocial Behavior
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mainstream mindfulness programs, as in first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, generally do not incorporate Buddhist ethics, causing some scholars to worry that they may encourage self-indulgence and have limited capacity to promote well-being. We compare the effects of practicing mindfulness with additional ethical instruction (EthicalM) or without such instruction (SecularM) on well-being and prosocial behavior. Participants (N = 621) completed 6 days of ethical or secular mindfulness exercises or active control exercises. Secular and ethical mindfulness both reduced stress (EthicalM: p = 0.011, d = -0.25; SecularM: p = 0.005, d = -0.28) and increased life satisfaction (EthicalM: p = 0.008, d = 0.26; SecularM: p = 0.069, d = 0.18) and self-awareness (EthicalM: p = 0.011, d = 0.25; SecularM: p = 0.051, d = 0.19). Ethical mindfulness also enhanced personal growth (p = 0.032, d = 0.21). Ethical, relative to secular, mindfulness also increased prosocial behavior-money donated to a charity (p = 0.020, d = 0.24). This effect was moderated by trait empathy: Trait empathy predicted donation amounts for participants who had completed mindfulness exercises (ethical or secular) but not controls. Furthermore, low trait empathy participants gave significantly less money following secular mindfulness practice than control exercises, whereas high trait empathy participants gave more money following ethical mindfulness practice than control exercises. Mindfulness training may thus have unintended consequences, making some people less charitable, though incorporating instruction on ethics, as in some second-generation mindfulness-based interventions, may forestall such effects.

TI  - Effect of mindfulness-based interventions on people with prehypertension or hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundHypertension and prehypertension have been widely recognized as the main contributors of global mortality. Evidence shows mindfulness-based interventions may reduce blood pressure and improve mental health. However, the effect of mindfulness-based interventions on blood pressure and mental health has not been fully understood. MethodsPotential studies published before May 24th 2023 were identified by searching Embase, Ovid Emcare, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, and VIP China Science. Additionally, two grey databases were searched: Mednar, WorldWideScience.org. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool. The random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using Review Man 5.4 software and the key outcomes are presented as mean difference or standard mean difference and the 95% confidential interval. ResultsSearches returned 802 studies in total, of which 12 were included (N = 715). The duration of interventions was 8 weeks in 10 trials and 6 weeks in one trial. Pooled effect sizes indicated reductions in systolic blood pressure (MD = - 9.12, 95% CI [- 12.18, - 6.05], p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (MD = - 5.66, 95% CI [- 8.88, - 2.43], p < 0.001), anxiety (SMD = - 4.10; 95% CI [- 6.49, - 1.71], p < 0.001), depression (SMD = - 1.70, 95%CI [- 2.95, - 0.44], p < 0.001) and perceived stress (SMD = - 5.91, 95%CI [- 8.74, - 3.09], p < 0.001) at post-intervention. The findings from subgroup analyses are favorable for mindfulness-based interventions regardless of gender and baseline blood pressure with regard to BP reduction, with a more profound effect observed in participants with higher pre-intervention blood pressure. ConclusionsThe results provide evidence for the positive role of mindfulness-based interventions in hypertension management. More large randomized control trials with sufficient statistical power and long-term follow-up are needed. Trial registrationThe protocol had been registered with Prospero on October 2nd 2021 (registration NO. CRD42021282504).

TI  - Mindfulness-Based IARA Model<SUP>®</SUP> Proves Effective to Reduce Stress and Anxiety in Health Care Professionals. A Six-Month Follow-Up Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the health care environment, together with specific work-related stressors and the consequences on workers' health and performance, have led to the implementation of prevention strategies. Among the different approaches, those which are mindfulness-based have been institutionally recommended with an indication provided as to their effectiveness in the management of stress. The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of the mindfulness-based IARA Model((R)) (an Italian acronym translatable into meeting, compliance, responsibility, autonomy) in order to ameliorate perceived stress, anxiety and enhance emotional regulation among health care professionals (HCPs; i.e., doctors, nurses, and healthcare assistants). Four hundred and ninety-seven HCPs, 215 (57.2%) of which were women, were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based training or control group and agreed to complete questionnaires on emotion regulation difficulties (DERS), anxiety, and perceived stress. Results showed that HCPs who attended the IARA training, compared to the control group, had better emotional regulation, anxiety and stress indices after 6 months from the end of the intervention. Furthermore, the results confirmed the positive relationship between emotional regulation, perceived stress and anxiety. The present study contributes to literature by extending the effectiveness of IARA in improving emotional regulation and well-being in non-clinical samples. Moreover, the study provides support for the idea that some specific emotional regulation processes can be implicated in perceived stress and anxiety. From the application point of view, companies should invest more in stress management intervention, monitoring and training, in order to develop worker skills, emotional self-awareness, and relational resources.

Research on loving-kindness meditation has investigated its impact on affective variables, but has not yet investigated its impact on cognition. The present study investigated the impact of loving-kindness meditation on an affective variable not yet examined in the literature-affective learning-as well as cognition. Participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or a three-session, loving-kindness meditation training. Our results suggest that the beginning stages of loving-kindness meditation training impact the tendency to learn to associate positivity with neutral stimuli and cognitive control. We discuss the implications of our findings and potential directions for future research.

TI  - A Feasibility Study of a Brief Mindfulness-Based Program for Parents of Preschool Children with Developmental Disabilities
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parents of children with developmental disabilities are more likely to report parental stress and depression. This, in turn, leads to vicious cycles of negative outcomes for these children and the family's well-being. To address the difficulties of such parents, the authors developed a brief mindfulness-based program for parents of children with developmental disabilities (six weekly sessions, nine total contact hours, and 10 min of daily home practice). A randomized control trial was designed to examine the effectiveness of the program, and 180 eligible parents were recruited and were allocated to intervention group and control group. The results showed that after completing the program, parents had significant improvements in parental stress (F[1, 176] = 4.76, p = .03), depression (F[1, 176] = 8.07, p = .01), and stress from parent-child dysfunctional interaction (F[1, 176] = 6.46, p = .01). Based on the pretest scores, parents with severe stress and depression reported more significant positive changes, and they reported moderate effect sizes of 0.62 for stress and 0.57 for depression, respectively. Participant satisfaction scores revealed that the parents were satisfied with the content and overall program arrangement, and agreed that their ability to cope with emotions and stress was enhanced. The results gave support to the program's feasibility. Future studies could further compare this brief program with a child behavior management program to investigate the outcomes and long-term benefits of this brief program. More directions for further studies are provided.

TI  - Evaluating the APAC (Mindfulness for Giftedness) Program in a Spanish Sample of Gifted Children: a Pilot Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have found that gifted children experience symptoms such as existential anguish, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion. The inherent intensity and sensitivity of these young people may make them more susceptible to significant emotional distress and existential concerns. Endeavoring to address such issues, we designed a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, called the "Atencion plena para altas capacidades" (APAC; Mindfulness for Giftedness). This paper presents the pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up findings on the implementation of the program in a sample of 22 gifted children in Spain. The program comprised eight weekly 90-min group sessions covering mindfulness, emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, acceptance, values, compassion, and self-compassion. The program's efficacy was measured using standardized, validated tools (the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the Children's Depression Inventory, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children, and the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire) at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up time periods.. Our study's findings at the posttreatment stage suggested that the APAC program improved the emotional abilities and reduced negative symptoms. Results from the 12-month follow-up assessment stage appeared to uphold these findings. However, we recommend that future second-generation mindfulness-based interventions for gifted children should include more activities and exercises that address the meaning of life and other related existential worries of particular concern to these young people.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on psychological well-being and quality of life:: Is increased mindfulness indeed the mechanism?
T2  - ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although several studies have reported positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention on psychological well-being, it is not known whether these effects are attributable to a change in mindfulness.Purpose The aim of this study is to compare the effects of MBSR to a waiting-list control condition in a randomized controlled trial while examining potentially mediating effects of mindfulness.Methods Forty women and 20 men from the community with symptoms of distress (mean age 43.6 years, SD=10.1) were randomized into a group receiving MBSR or a waiting-list control group. Before and after the intervention period, questionnaires were completed on psychological well-being, quality of life, and mindfulness.Results Repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (MANCOVAs) showed that, compared with the control group, the intervention resulted in significantly stronger reductions of perceived stress (p=0.016) and vital exhaustion (p=0.001) and stronger elevations of positive affect (p=0.006), quality of life (p=.009), as well as mindfulness (p=0.001). When mindfulness was included as a covariate in the MANCOVA, the group effects on perceived stress and quality of life were reduced to nonsignificance.Conclusions Increased mindfulness may, at least partially, mediate the positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention.

TI  - Translating and Implementing a Mindfulness-Based Youth Suicide Prevention Intervention in a Native American Community
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is a feasibility study, aimed at investigating whether a mindfulness-based prevention intervention can be translated and implemented in a Native American youth population. Guided by the adaptation process model, a mindfulness youth suicide prevention intervention was developed and implemented in a Native American school. One group of eight youth, ages 15-20, participated in a 9-week pilot of the intervention. Results of the mixed-methods process and outcome evaluation suggest that the intervention is acceptable to Native American youth, with positive indications in terms of better self-regulation, less mind wandering, and decreased suicidal thoughts. It became clearly evident that a collaborative and indigenous research framework is both required and necessary to ensure feasibility and sustainability of mindfulness-based interventions.

TI  - Prayer: A Helpful Aid in Recovery from Depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Depression is a growing issue within the field of medicine. It negatively impacts individuals' lives and the people they are most connected to. For decades, medical professionals have been searching for solutions to assist those who are suffering from this illness. The use of drugs has not been a sufficient means of treatment to alleviate depression and its symptoms. There is a dire need to expand therapeutic interventions that can attribute meaningful recovery for victims of depression. One means of positive treatment is the use of prayer. Prayer, one of the most ancient forms of meditation, aligns and relaxes the mental state of the mind. The uses of drugs are limited by physiological focus, but prayer is a mechanism that brings human beings into a unique state of oneness. Oneness comprises the holistic nature of a human being and asserts the triad of well-being: mind, body, and spirit. As the emergence of humanities and holism continues in medicine, centering/meditative prayer and similar practices like mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can be useful therapeutic interventions specifically for major depressed patients.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies in Patients With Breast Cancer Under Early Chemotherapy-a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been receiving growing attention in cancer care. This study evaluated the impact of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on quality of life, psychological distress (anxiety and depression), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy. A total of 101 patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy were randomly assigned to either an 8-week MBSR group (n = 50) or a control group (n = 51). The primary outcome was quality of life, measured on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer. The secondary outcomes were anxiety (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-rating Depression Scale), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (The Chinese version of Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire). The participants were assessed at baseline (T0) and week 8 (T1). The data were statistically analyzed by SPSS 21.0. The participants in the MBSR group experienced significantly better outcomes in their quality of life, psychological distress, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies than the control group. The MBSR intervention was demonstrated to improve the positive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and quality of life in patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy and significantly reduce the patient's anxiety, depression, and negative cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and help the patients to adjust their mental state and promote positive psychology to improve their quality of life.

TI  - Understanding preferences for a mindfulness-based stress management program among caregivers of hematopoietic cell transplant patients
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Informal caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients experience significant levels of stress throughout the caregiving process. One strategy that has been shown to aid in stress management in other populations is mindfulness. The goal of this study was to understand caregivers' experiences with mindfulness and evaluate their receptiveness to a mindfulness-based stress management program. Data were collected via indepth phone interviews from 18 caregivers (55% female). Results indicated that about half the sample was familiar with mindfulness and/or had practiced meditation. The majority indicated that they believed a mindfulness program would have been useful for them and that they would have been willing to participate. Most indicated that a program delivered once-weekly for 60 min, during both inpatient and outpatient phases, would be preferable through a combination of in-person and mobile-based delivery. These data provide critical information for the development of future mindfulness-based interventions for this caregiving population.

TI  - Fixing Our Focus: Training Attention to Regulate Emotion
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical studies have frequently linked negative attentional biases with attentional dysfunction and negative moods; however, far less research has focused on how attentional deployment can be an adaptive strategy that regulates emotional experience. The authors argue that attention may be an invaluable tool for promoting emotion regulation. Accordingly, they present evidence that selective attention to positive information reflects emotion regulation and that regulating attention is a critical component of the emotion regulatory process. Furthermore, attentional regulation can be successfully trained through repeated practice. The authors ultimately propose a model of attention training methodologies integrating attention-dependent emotion regulation strategies with attention networks. Although additional interdisciplinary research is needed to bolster these nascent findings, meditative practices appear to be among the most effective training methodologies in enhancing emotional well-being. Further exploration of the positive and therapeutic qualities of attention warrants the empirical attention of social and personality psychologists.

TI  - Being Mindful at University: A Pilot Evaluation of the Feasibility of an Online Mindfulness-Based Mental Health Support Program for Students
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - University study can be a life period of heightened psychological distress for many students. The development of new preventive and intervention programs to support well-being in university students is a fundamental challenge for mental health professionals. We designed an 8-week online mindfulness-based program (eMBP) combining a face-to-face approach, text, audio, video components, and support psychotherapy principles with a unique intensive reminder system using the Facebook Messenger and Slack applications in two separate runs (N = 692). We assessed the program's effect on mindful experiencing, perceived stress, emotion regulation strategies, self-compassion, negative affect, and quality of life. The results of the presented pilot study confirmed that eMBP is a feasible and effective tool in university students' mental health support. The students who completed the eMBP reported a reduction of perceived stress with a large effect size ((p)eta(2) = 0.42) as well as a decrease of negative affect experience frequency and intensity ((p)eta(2) = 0.31), an increase of being mindful in their life (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire subscales:(p)eta(2) = 0.21, 0.27, 0.25, 0.28, 0.28), and a higher rate of self-compassion ((p)eta(2) = 0.28) with a medium effect size. A small effect size was found in the frequency of using a cognitive reappraisal strategy ((p)eta(2) = 0.073). One new result is the observation of an eMBP effect ((p)eta(2) = 0.27) on the decrease in attributed importance to the quality-of-life components replicated in two consecutive runs of the program. The study affirms that mindfulness-based interventions can be effectively delivered in an eHealth form to university students.

TI  - CALM Pregnancy: results of a pilot study of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for perinatal anxiety
T2  - ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many women experience anxiety during pregnancy with potential negative effects on maternal, birth, and child outcomes. Because of potential risks of fetal exposure to psychotropic medications, efficacious non-pharmacologic approaches are urgently needed. However, no published studies of psychotherapeutic treatments for anxiety in pregnancy exist. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may substantially reduce anxiety and co-morbid symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. Coping with Anxiety through Living Mindfully (CALM) Pregnancy is an adaptation of MBCT designed to address anxiety in pregnant women. This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of the CALM Pregnancy intervention in pregnant women anxiety. Twenty-four pregnant women with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or prominent symptoms of generalized anxiety participated in an open treatment trial of the CALM Pregnancy group intervention. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by structured clinical interview, and self-report measures of anxiety, worry, depression, self-compassion, and mindfulness were completed at baseline and post-intervention. Qualitative feedback was elicited via questionnaire. Twenty-three participants completed the intervention with high attendance and good compliance with home practice. Completers showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in anxiety, worry, and depression, and significant increases in self-compassion and mindfulness. Of the 17 participants who met GAD criteria at baseline, only one continued to meet criteria post-intervention. Participants regarded their experience in the intervention to be overwhelmingly positive. MBCT in the form of the CALM Pregnancy intervention holds potential to provide effective, non-pharmacological treatment for pregnant women with anxiety. These promising findings warrant further testing of the intervention with a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Piloting a Mindfulness-Based Intervention to Veterinary Students: Learning and Recommendations
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Veterinary students experience high levels of psychological distress including anxiety, stress, perceived stress and depression. The inability to cope with the demands of veterinary training has personal and professional consequences. Existing evidence shows that mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) can reduce stress in students, but more research on how MBIs are introduced into the veterinary curriculum is required. The first aim of the pilot study was to design and deliver a bespoke MBI to third-year veterinary students at the University of Liverpool Institute of Veterinary Science. The second aim was to gain feedback from those taking part, thus using their experiences to explore the challenges of introducing an MBI into a veterinary curriculum. By doing this, we aim to reflect and learn for future interventions. Qualitative feedback provided by participants of the MBI focus group was analyzed using thematic analysis and organized into two main themes: (1) "Taking Part in the MBI and Beyond-What it Was Like and What Has the MBI Done for Me?" and (2) "Mindfulness for Veterinary Students-Reflections, Challenges, and Making it Happen." Experiences and outcomes of the MBI were positive. However, implementation into the veterinary curriculum was found to be challenging. This pilot study provides clear recommendations to support the future integration and delivery of MBIs into a veterinary curriculum.

TI  - A RCT Comparing Daily Mindfulness Meditations, Biofeedback Exercises, and Daily Physical Exercise on Attention Control, Executive Functioning, Mindful Awareness, Self-Compassion, and Worrying in Stressed Young Adults
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our Western society is characterized by multitasking, competition, and constant time pressure. Negative effects of stress for the individual (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and for organizations and society (costs due to work absence) are very high. Thus, time-efficient self-help interventions to address these issues are necessary. This study assessed the effects of daily mindfulness meditations (MM) versus daily heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) and daily physical exercise (PE) on attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying. Young adults (n = 75, age range 18 to 40) with elevated stress levels were randomized to MM, HRV-BF, or PE, and measurements were taken at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. Interventions in all three groups were self-guided and lasted for 5 weeks. Generalized estimating equation analyses showed that overall, all three interventions were effective and did not differ from each other. However, practice time differed between groups, with participants in the PE group practicing much more than participants in the other two groups. Therefore, additional analyses were carried out in two subsamples. The optimal dose sample included only those participants who practiced for at least 70 % of the total prescribed time. In the equal dose sample, home practice intensity was equal for all three groups. Again, the effects of the three interventions did not differ. In conclusion, MM, HRV-BF, and PE are all effective self-help methods to improve attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying, and mindfulness meditation was not found to be more effective than HRV-biofeedback or physical exercise for these cognitive processes.

TI  - Effects of a Brief Mindfulness Intervention on After-Degree Nursing Student Stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This exploratory study investigated the effectiveness of a shortened version of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with a small sample of after-degree nursing students for managing stress during their practicum. Method: A qualitative evaluation design with a purposive criterion sample (n = 5) was used to investigate the impact of a Brief Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR-B) intervention on the experience of stress in after-degree nursing students. Results: Thematic analysis of participants' narratives resulted in the identification of four categories: (a) hitting a reset button, (b) self-compassion, (c) avoiding a downward spiral, and (d) using an internal coping mechanism. These findings suggested a metatheme of self-awareness involving more efficient and effective detection and management of stress. Conclusion: The positive impact for participants in this study suggests that stress management for after-degree nursing students through the use of an MBSR-B intervention is worthy of nurse educators' consideration.

TI  - Out of sight, out of mind? Exploring the long-term effects of Relational Mindfulness Training (RMT)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies showed mixed findings regarding the sustainability of the effects of mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation interventions. This study, conducted on a sample of 128 management students divided into treatment and control groups, is the first that examines the long-term effects of the training in relational mindfulness. We focus on Relational Mindfulness Training (RMT), an 8-week intervention designed to help participants to be more present, aware, and kind towards themselves and others during social interactions. The results show a significant long-term impact of RMT on self-compassion, perceived stress and mindfulness. The impact of RMT on compassion and subjective happiness was significant in the short run, but only marginally significant in the long run for compassion and non-significant for subjective happiness. Furthermore, individuals who maintained an individual practice in the follow-up period showed notably better results concerning all examined effects, except compassion. The results suggest that the development of compassion is more dependent on the context of a training group. We provide recommendations for future interventions in order that they can make a more sustainable impact on compassion.

TI  - Loving-kindness language exposure leads to changes in sensitivity to imagined pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the cultivation of positive intra- and interpersonal emotions, we examined an argument that some effects of contemplative training result from language processing. We presented participants with loving-kindness language used in kindness-meditation training studies and asked them to rate imagined pain. If loving-kindness language processing is responsible for some effects recently reported we expected this language could affect intra- and interpersonal sensitivity. Loving-kindness-language participants rated imagined other-pain significantly higher and imagined self-pain significantly lower than closely matched control participants. As a result of this interaction, the loving-kindness-language group showed no significant difference between self-pain and other-pain, whereas controls rated self-pain significantly higher than other-pain. These results suggest that exposure to loving-kindness-language in Loving-Kindness Meditation leads to changes in sensitivity to own and vicarious distress without explicit training. These findings underscore that meditation-like effects may be easily induced. Further research is needed to determine duration and degree of effect.

TI  - Exploring positive psychology intervention and mindfulness-based intervention in nature: impact on well-being of school students in India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Enhancing the well-being of urban school students is a growing challenge. The online mode of teaching during and post-pandemic era has increased students' daily screen time. As they spend more time indoors, they tend to disconnect from nature even more, adversely impacting their well-being. This study aimed to design and execute two well-being interventions-a positive psychology intervention (PPI) and a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in natural settings for urban school students in India.Methods One hundred eighty participants (aged 17-20) from a senior secondary school were randomly assigned to three groups: PPI, MBI, and a control group (CTR). Participants self-reported their levels of well-being, gratitude, inclusion of nature in self, sense of connectedness, resilience, awareness, perceived stress, and positive and negative emotions using a survey questionnaire at two times-pre- and post-interventions. Repeated-measures ANOVA was employed across time and groups, and post hoc analyses for group differences were carried out through the Bonferroni test.Results Results indicate that both PPI and MBI interventions, when executed in natural settings, enhance student well-being, gratitude, inclusion of nature in self, sense of connectedness, resilience, awareness, positive emotions and decreased levels of perceived stress, and negative emotions.Discussion The study provides valuable insights for school authorities, policymakers, and urban planners to include natural settings in school premises and offer well-being interventions for students to connect with nature consciously.

TI  - Predictors and Effects of Usage of an Online Mindfulness Intervention for Distressed Cancer Patients: Usability Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: One in three cancer patients experience high psychological distress. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing psychological distress in this patient group. However, these interventions lack availability and flexibility, which may compromise participation in the intervention for cancer patients experiencing late symptoms like fatigue or pain. Therefore, mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly offered via the internet. However, little is known about the usage of these online mindfulness-based interventions.Objective: The aim of this study was to (1) predict uptake of and adherence to online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) using baseline patient characteristics (demographic, cancer-related, personality, and psychological variables) and (2) examine the relations between adherence and treatment outcomes in eMBCT for cancer patients.Methods: A total of 125 cancer patients were assigned to eMBCT in a parent randomized controlled trial comparing MBCT and eMBCT with treatment as usual in distressed cancer patients. Various usage measures of eMBCT were automatically tracked within the online program. Based on activity of use, participants were classified as nonusers, minimal users, low users, and intended users. Questionnaires were used to assess baseline characteristics (preintervention) and outcomes (pre- and postintervention). To answer the research questions, data were analyzed with t tests, chi(2) tests, and linear regression models.Results: Based on weekly activity, participants were classified as nonusers (n=17, 13.6%), who completed no exercises in MBCT; minimal users (n=31, 24.8%), who completed at least one exercise of one to three sessions; low users (n=12, 9.6%), who completed at least one exercise of four to seven sessions; and intended users (n=65, 52.0%), who completed at least one exercise of eight to nine sessions. Nonusers had more fear of cancer recurrence at baseline than users (uptake), and intended users were more conscientious than minimal and low users (adherence). Intended users reported a larger reduction in psychological distress and more improvement of positive mental health (ie, emotional, psychological, and social well-being) after the intervention than other participants.Conclusions: This study showed that adherence was related to improved patient outcomes. Patients with strong fear of recurrence or low levels of conscientiousness should receive extra attention, as they are less likely to respectively start or complete eMBCT. Future research may focus on the development of flexible and adaptive eMBCT programs to fit individual needs.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to investigate the effects of loving-kindness meditation on positive emotions, intragroup interactions, and complex understanding of others. A total of 50 freshmen not receiving any training in meditation intervention were randomly divided into the meditation group (25 subjects) and the control group (25 subjects). The meditation group was implemented with group meditation intervention for 4 weeks, three times a week, about 30 minutes each time. The results revealed that the effect sizes in interpersonal interaction and complex understanding of others in the meditation group were both above 0.8, indicating strong effects. It was concluded that loving-kindness meditation can effectively improve positive emotions, interpersonal interactions, and complex understanding of others in college students.

TI  - Can Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Influence the Quality of Life, Anxiety, and Depression of Women Diagnosed with Breast Cancer? -A Review
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancerous disease worldwide. Its treatment leads to a variety of physiological and psychological side effects. This review investigates the question of how mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a stress management program, can influence the quality of life, anxiety, and depression of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library. Screening by title, abstract and full text was performed, whereby only those articles were included that fit the inclusion criteria. A risk of bias assessment was performed for each included study. Results: Overall, six studies were included, but not every study investigated all three outcomes. Two studies found positive impacts on quality of life, whereas three did not find a positive correlation between the intervention and quality of life. Four out of six studies found a positive relation between MBSR and anxiety scores, but only half of the included studies found positive results for the interaction between MBSR and depression scores. Conclusion: Published data suggest that anxiety can be positively influenced by MBSR, which can be used to improve the psychological care of breast cancer patients, both during and after treatment. However, further studies with larger patient numbers and longer observation periods should be conducted in order to elucidate the full potential of MSBR on important areas such as depression and quality of life.

TI  - Daily Mindful Responding Mediates the Effect of Meditation Practice on Stress and Mood: The Role of Practice Duration and Adherence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveAlthough meditation practice is an important component of many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), empirical findings of its effects on psychological functioning aremixed and the mechanisms for the effects remain unclear. Responding with mindfulness (i.e., returning one's attention back to anonjudgmental, present-oriented awareness) is a fundamental skill practiced in meditations. With repeated meditation practice, this skill isthought to become internalized and be applied to one's daily life. We thus hypothesized that the extent to which individuals responded to dailyevents with mindfulness would mediate the effects of meditation practice (instance, duration, and adherence to instructions) on psychological well-being.MethodUsing a daily diary methodology, we tracked the meditation practice, use of mindful responding during the day, and psychological outcomes (perceived stress, negative and positive affect) of 117 mindfulness-based stress reduction program participants.ResultsWe found that on days when participants meditated, they responded with greater mindfulness to daily events, which accounted for the beneficial effects of meditating on psychological outcomes. Furthermore, findings suggest that on meditation days, longer and more closely adhered meditation practices were independently associated with increases in mindful responding, which in turn were associated with better psychological outcomes.ConclusionThese results suggest that regular, longer, and more closely adhered meditation practice is an important component of MBIs, in part because it leads to responding more mindfully in daily life,which promotes well-being.

TI  - Mindfulness and positive psychology interventions for depression: A controlled comparative pilot study
T2  - PSYCHOLOGIE FRANCAISE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims. - The aim of this pilot comparative study was to compare the efficacy and the processes of two third wave psychotherapy interventions (a Mindfulness Based Intervention and a Positive Psychology Intervention) in the reduction of moderate to severe depression. Methods. - Twenty-seven patients (mean age = 44 years old) suffering from moderate to severe depression were recruited in a psychiatric clinic in the South -Est of France. They were randomized to either a Mindfulness Based Intervention (MBI; n = 10) or a Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI; n = 12) and compared to a Treatment As Usual (TAU; n = 5) group who benefited from psychoeducational and classical cognitive behavioral emotion regulation workshops. The interventions were based on existing validated mindfulness and positive psychology interventions (MBCT and CARE). Participants completed questionnaires before (T1), after (T2) and one month after the intervention (T3). These questionnaires measured depressive symptoms, hopelessness, well-being, authentic -sustainable happiness, psychological flexibility, procrastination, and attention orientation towards the positive aspects of life. These data were completed by qualitative data collected through semi -directed interviews at T2 in order to assess to what extent each participant had found the intervention useful and adapted to their needs. These interviews also assessed how much participants expressed motivation to continue the practices learnt. Results. - Participants showed reduced depressive symptoms and hopelessness, enhanced well-being, authentic -sustainable happiness, psychological flexibility, and attention orientation towards positive aspects of life at T2 in both interventions, which were maintained at T3. Procrastination significantly decreased at T2 only for the PPI group. The TAU control group only showed a significant increase in well-being at T2. The results from the semi -directed interviews underlined that the patients perceived the interventions as useful in terms of increased openness and self -kindness (MBI) as well as altruistic attitudes (PPI).<br /> Conclusion. - Although the interventions are distinct, the effects appear to be similar in terms of efficacy and mechanisms of action, apart from a greater behavioral activation in the PPI intervention. The mindfulness based intervention group intervention and the positive psychology group intervention carried out in this study appeared to be adapted to the patients and mostly positive psychology practices were reported to be easily used outside the sessions.

TI  - Differential Effects of Mindfulness-Based Intervention Programs at Work on Psychological Wellbeing and Work Engagement
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two different mindfulness-based interventions were deployed in a sample of white-collar workers to explore the differential effects on different facets of mindfulness, dimensions of psychological wellbeing, work engagement, performance, and stress of a participant. A total of 28 participants completed one of the different programs, and their results were compared between groups and against 27 participants randomly allocated to a waiting list control group. Results suggest both mindfulness intervention programs were successful at increasing the levels of psychological wellbeing, work engagement, and performance of the participants, as well as decreasing their levels of stress. Significant differences were found between the two programs in all outcome variables. Results suggest that brief and customized mindfulness interventions at work are as successful as lengthier programs.

TI  - Mindfulness-based strengths practice improves well-being and retention in undergraduates: a preliminary randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: With high rates of mental health concerns on college campuses, effective positive psychology interventions could greatly improve student well-being and academic outcomes. Participants: Working undergraduates (N = 52). Methods: This preliminary, randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of the 8-week Mindfulness-based strengths practice (MBSP) on Seligman's five domains of well-being, as measured by the PERMA-Profiler, Workplace PERMA-Profiler, and student retention in working undergraduates. Results: Students in the MBSP intervention had significantly higher well-being, engagement, meaning, and health following the MBSP program (P < 0.0042). No such changes were observed in the control group. Students in the intervention group also had modestly higher retention rates in the following academic year than those in the control group. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence to date that an MBSP program can improve college student well-being and retention.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation and substance use in an incarcerated population
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the availability of various substance abuse treatments, alcohol and drug misuse and related negative consequences remain prevalent. Vipassana meditation (VM), a Buddhist mindfulness-based practice, provides an alternative for individuals who do not wish to attend or have not succeeded with traditional addiction treatments. In this study, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of a VM course on substance use and psychosocial outcomes in an incarcerated population. Results indicate that after release from jail, participants in the VM course, as compared with those in a treatment-as-usual control condition, showed significant reductions in alcohol, marijuana, and crack cocaine use. VM participants showed decreases in alcohol-related problems and psychiatric symptoms as well as increases in positive psychosocial outcomes. The utility of mindfulness-based treatments for substance use is discussed.

TI  - BOLD signal and functional connectivity associated with loving kindness meditation
T2  - BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving kindness is a form of meditation involving directed well-wishing, typically supported by the silent repetition of phrases such as "may all beings be happy," to foster a feeling of selfless love. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neural substrate of loving kindness meditation in experienced meditators and novices. We first assessed group differences in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during loving kindness meditation. We next used a relatively novel approach, the intrinsic connectivity distribution of functional connectivity, to identify regions that differ in intrinsic connectivity between groups, and then used a data-driven approach to seed-based connectivity analysis to identify which connections differ between groups. Our findings suggest group differences in brain regions involved in self-related processing and mind wandering, emotional processing, inner speech, and memory. Meditators showed overall reduced BOLD signal and intrinsic connectivity during loving kindness as compared to novices, more specifically in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), a finding that is consistent with our prior work and other recent neuroimaging studies of meditation. Furthermore, meditators showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between the PCC/PCu and the left inferior frontal gyrus, whereas novices showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between the PCC/PCu and other cortical midline regions of the default mode network, the bilateral posterior insula lobe, and the bilateral parahippocampus/hippocampus. These novel findings suggest that loving kindness meditation involves a present-centered, selfless focus for meditators as compared to novices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions have shown to reduce psychological distress in cancer patients. The accessibility of mindfulness-based interventions for cancer patients could be further improved by providing mindfulness using an individual internet-based format. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) group intervention for cancer patients in comparison with individual internet-based MBCT and treatment as usual (TAU).METHODS/DESIGN: A three-armed multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing group-based MBCT to individual internet-based MBCT and TAU in cancer patients who suffer from at least mild psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) ≥ 11). Measurements will be conducted prior to randomization (baseline), post-treatment and at 3 months and 9 months post-treatment. Participants initially allocated to TAU are subsequently randomized to either group- or individual internet-based MBCT and will receive a second baseline measurement after 3 months. Thus, the three-armed comparison will have a time span of approximately 3 months. The two-armed intervention comparison includes a 9-month follow-up and will also consist of participants randomized to the intervention after TAU. Primary outcome will be post-treatment psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes are fear of cancer recurrence (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory), rumination (Rumination and Reflection Questionnaire), positive mental health (Mental Health Continuum - Short Form), and cost-effectiveness (health-related quality of life (EuroQol -5D and Short Form-12) and health care usage (Trimbos and iMTA questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness). Potential predictors: DSM-IV-TR mood/anxiety disorders (SCID-I) and neuroticism (NEO-Five Factor Inventory) will be measured. Mediators of treatment effect: mindfulness skills, (Five-Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire- Short Form), working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) and group cohesion (Group Cohesion Questionnaire) will also be measured.DISCUSSION: This trial will provide valuable information on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of group versus internet-based MBCT versus TAU for distressed cancer patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02138513.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation is a practice designed to enhance feelings of kindness and compassion for self and others. Loving-kindness meditation involves repetition of phrases of positive intention for self and others. We undertook an open pilot trial of loving-kindness meditation for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Measures of PTSD, depression, self-compassion, and mindfulness were obtained at baseline, after a 12-week loving-kindness meditation course, and 3 months later. Effect sizes were calculated from baseline to each follow-up point, and self-compassion was assessed as a mediator. Attendance was high; 74% attended 9-12 classes. Self-compassion increased with large effect sizes and mindfulness increased with medium to large effect sizes. A large effect size was found for PTSD symptoms at 3-month follow-up (d = -0.89), and a medium effect size was found for depression at 3-month follow-up (d = -0.49). There was evidence of mediation of reductions in PTSD symptoms and depression by enhanced self-compassion. Overall, loving-kindness meditation appeared safe and acceptable and was associated with reduced symptoms of PTSD and depression. Additional study of loving-kindness meditation for PTSD is warranted to determine whether the changes seen are due to the loving-kindness meditation intervention versus other influences, including concurrent receipt of other treatments.

TI  - Imagination-Based Loving-Kindness and Compassion Meditation: A New Meditation Method Developed from Chinese Buddhism
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many loving-kindness and compassion meditation methods used in psychological research are derived from Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Zhiyi ((sic)), a representative figure of Chinese Buddhism, proposed a different meditation method, namely, imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation. The current article introduces the imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation proposed by Zhiyi and compares it with meditation methods from Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Zhiyi's method limits the content of imagination during meditation, which can be an essential supplement to the free association method derived from Theravada Buddhism. Zhiyi's method of helping others entirely through imagination differs significantly from the tonglen method derived from Tibetan Buddhism and may be more suitable for participants without religious beliefs. Based on Zhiyi's source text and previous psychological studies, a mental-health training program for imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation is proposed. The limitations of Zhiyi's method and the future directions for empirical research on Zhiyi's method are also discussed. The differences between Zhiyi's method and other methods in terms of effects and applicable populations need to be examined in future studies.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PROBLEM: The purpose of this study was to reduce perceived levels of interprofessional staff stress and to improve patient and staff safety by implementing a brief mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training program on a highacuity psychiatric inpatient unit.METHODS: A one-group repeated measure design was utilized to measure the impact of the (MBSR) training program on staff stress and safety immediately posttraining and at 2months. Two instruments were utilized in the study: the Toronto Mindfulness Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale.FINDINGS: The MBSR program reduced staff stress across the 2-month post-training period and increased staff mindfulness immediately following the brief training period of 8days, and across the 2-month post-training period. A trend toward positive impact on patient and staff safety was also seen in a decreased number of staff call-ins, decreased need for 1:1 staffing episodes, and decreased restraint use 2months following the training period.CONCLUSIONS: A brief MBSR training program offered to an interprofessional staff of a high-acuity inpatient adolescent psychiatric unit was effective in decreasing their stress, increasing their mindfulness, and improving staff and patient safety.

TI  - Putting Oneself in the Body of Others: A Pilot Study on the Efficacy of an Embodied Virtual Reality System to Generate Self-Compassion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compassion-based interventions (CBIs) have been shown to be effective for increasing empathy and compassion, and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.

TI  - Primary Care-Based Mindfulness Intervention for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Symptoms Among Black Adults: A Pilot Feasibility and Acceptability Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: There is support for the use of mindfulness-based approaches with trauma-exposed adults. However, limited data are available on feasibility and acceptability of group-based mindfulness interventions in urban medical clinics serving primarily Black adults with low socioeconomic resources, where rates of trauma exposure are high. The present randomized pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week adapted mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group for trauma-exposed Black adults who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in an urban primary care clinic setting. Method: Participants were randomized to waitlist control (WLC) or MBCT. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through examination of retention rates, measures of group satisfaction and treatment barriers, and qualitative interview. Forty-two Black adults (85% women) were consented; of those, 34 (81%) completed preassessment and randomization. Results: Feasibility of study design was shown, with >75% (n = 26) of randomized participants completing the study through postassessment. Twenty-four individuals (70.5%) completed through 1-month follow-up. Results showed high levels of group acceptability across quantitative and qualitative measures. Perceived barriers to psychological treatment were high, with an average of >6 barriers present. Conclusions: The findings indicate feasibility and acceptability of MBCT group interventions in urban primary care settings with trauma-exposed patients with significant psychopathology. However, substantial barriers to treatment engagement were endorsed and to improve numbers for successful engagement in the intervention, continued efforts to reduce treatment barriers and increase access to mindfulness-based interventions in underresourced communities are needed.Clinical Impact Statement This study shows that providing a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group to trauma-exposed Black adult patients with low socioeconomic resources and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms in a primary care clinic setting is feasible and acceptable. However, many barriers must be addressed to improve behavioral health care engagement and access in marginalized communities.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewMindfulness, the practice of paying attention to the present moment, purposefully and nonjudgmentally, has been gaining popularity as adjunct treatment for adolescents with a range of physical and mental health problems. Research conducted in adults and emerging research conducted in adolescents has shown that mindfulness-based interventions can improve outcomes in several areas. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent research on the effects of mindfulness and suggest exercises that primary care clinicians can offer to their adolescent patients.Recent findingsResearch has shown positive effects of mindfulness across several health conditions commonly encountered during adolescence. Mindfulness-based Interventions can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. The application of mindfulness can help with the prevention and treatment of binge eating, over-eating, and restrictive eating disorders. In the treatment of substance use disorders, mindfulness can improve emotion regulation and reduce symptoms of withdrawal and craving. Mindfulness can also lead to improvement in overall quality of life for patients suffering from chronic pain. Lastly, mindfulness can be useful for adolescents with ADHD, sleep problems, chronic illness, and stress related to performance sports.SummaryAlthough research in adolescents remains limited, mindfulness holds promise in the treatment of a range of health conditions in adolescents.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Nonremitted Patients with Bipolar Disorder
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Bipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and/or mania along with interepisodic mood symptoms that interfere with psychosocial functioning. Despite periods of symptomatic recovery, many individuals with bipolar disorder continue to experience substantial residual mood symptoms that often lead to the recurrence of mood episodes.Aims: This study explored whether a new mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for bipolar disorder would increase mindfulness, reduce residual mood symptoms, and increase emotion-regulation abilities, psychological well-being, positive affect, and psychosocial functioning. Following a baseline clinical assessment, 12 individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were treated with 12 group sessions of MBCT.Results: At the end of treatment, as well as at the 3 months follow-up, participants showed increased mindfulness, lower residual depressive mood symptoms, less attentional difficulties, and increased emotion-regulation abilities, psychological well-being, positive affect, and psychosocial functioning.Conclusions: These findings suggest that treating residual mood symptoms with MBCT may be another avenue to improving mood, emotion regulation, well-being, and functioning in individuals with bipolar disorder.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical introduction on Second-Generation MindfulnessBased Interventions (SG-MBIs) to sport and performance psychology scholars and practitioners.Method: This essay is written as a commentary on Roychowdhury et al.'s, (2021, this issue) article in this issue. Specifically, I apply theoretical insights from Roychowdhury et al., (2021, this issue) to the practical model of SG-MBIs.Results: I find that SG-MBIs attempt to respond to ethical concerns with the ways that mindfulness has been commodified, secularized, and universalized through appeals to cultural authenticity.Discussion: While acknowledging the cultural contexts from which practices like mindfulness have been taken is important, appeals to cultural authenticity often reproduce fixed and essentializing constructions of culture and are easily coopted by neoliberal multiculturalism.Conclusion: As sport and performance psychology professionals reflect on the next generation of mindfulnessbased interventions, it will be important to attend to the contextual flexibility of neoliberalism to universalize and essentialize.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Family mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) targets child self-control, parenting and parental mental health, but its effectiveness is still unclear.Methods MindChamp is a pre-registered randomised controlled trial comparing an 8-week family MBI (called 'MYmind') in addition to care-as-usual (CAU) (n = 55) with CAU-only (n = 48). Children aged 8-16 years with remaining ADHD symptoms after CAU were enrolled together with a parent. Primary outcome was post-treatment parent-rated child self-control deficits (BRIEF); post hoc, Reliable Change Indexes were explored. Secondary child outcomes included ADHD symptoms (parent/teacher-rated Conners' and SWAN; teacher-rated BRIEF), other psychological symptoms (parent/teacher-rated), well-being (parent-rated) and mindfulness (self-rated). Secondary parent outcomes included self-ratings of ADHD symptoms, other psychological symptoms, well-being, self-compassion and mindful parenting. Assessments were conducted at post-treatment, 2- and 6-month follow-up.Results Relative to CAU-only, MBI+CAU resulted in a small, statistically non-significant post-treatment improvement on the BRIEF (intention-to-treat: d = 0.27, p = .18; per protocol: d = 0.33, p = .11). Significantly more children showed reliable post-treatment improvement following MBI+CAU versus CAU-only (32% versus 11%, p < .05, Number-Needed-to-Treat = 4.7). ADHD symptoms significantly reduced post-treatment according to parent (Conners' and SWAN) and teacher ratings (BRIEF) per protocol. Only parent-rated hyperactivity impulsivity (SWAN) remained significantly reduced at 6-month follow-up. Post-treatment group differences on other secondary child outcomes were consistently favour of MBI+CAU, but mostly non-significant; no significant differences were found at follow-ups. Regarding parent outcomes, significant post-treatment improvements were found for their own ADHD symptoms, well-being and mindful parenting. At follow-ups, some significant effects remained (ADHD symptoms, mindful parenting), some additional significant effects appeared (other psychological symptoms, self-compassion) and others disappeared/remained non-significant.Conclusions Family MBI+CAU did not outperform CAU-only in reducing child self-control deficits on a group level but more children reliably improved. Effects on parents were larger and more durable. When CAU for ADHD is insufficient, family MBI could be a valuable addition.

TI  - Effect of Mindfulness on Value Incongruence: a Pilot Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inclusion of Buddhist mindfulness perspectives in second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) offers an opportunity to explore the cultivation of ethical action in MBIs and address concerns about the purported absence of ethics in MBIs. This pilot study examined the relationship between mindfulness and value incongruence following a second-generation MBI, mindfulness-based symptom management (MBSM) that incorporates the Five Skillful Habits (5SH), a value-congruence practice. Sixty-one participants (65.6% female, M-age=44.5; 34.4% male, M-age=54.3) attended an 8-week program whose curriculum included the commitment to and practices of ethical and compassionate behaviors that reflected participants' personal values. The impact of MBSM on mindfulness (Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), congruence between ideal values and their lived experience of those values (Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire (SWBQ)), and relationships between mindfulness and value incongruence were examined. Results indicated that increases in all of the FFMQ factors occurred: Observe (p<.001, d=.52), Describe (p<.01, d=.39), Act with Awareness (p<.001; d=.68), Non-judgment (p<001, d=.67), and Non-reactivity (p<.001, d=.64). Value incongruence decreased on three of the four factors of the SWBQ: Personal (p<.001; d=-.64), Communal (p<.001; d=-.44), and Environmental (p<.01; d=-.40), with no significant changes occurring in Transcendental value incongruence (p>.10; d=-.21). Change scores for several factors of the FFMQ were significantly correlated with changes in the SWBQ measures. These preliminary results suggested that MBSM was related to shifts in value incongruence. Exploring the relationship between mindfulness and the practice of value-congruent behaviors may clarify the pathway between cultivating awareness and ethical/compassionate action.

TI  - Using Mindfulness to Improve Mental Health Outcomes of Immigrant Women with Experiences of Intimate Partner Violence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Immigrant women are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence (IPV), which poses risk for mental health problems, such as PTSD and depression. Post-migration barriers limit immigrant women's access to supportive services, which can further debilitate their mental health symptoms and their safety. The Being safe, Healthy, and Positively Empowered (BSHAPE) digital intervention was designed to address physical safety and healthcare needs of immigrant women through a multi-component approach that integrated mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) practices. This paper reports qualitative feedback findings from eighteen Black immigrant women with recent IPV exposure and co-occurring mental health symptoms, who participated in the mindfulness sessions of BSHAPE. We identified elements of mindfulness that women perceived as beneficial in their healing. Women's feedback indicated healing and empowerment through positive appraisals and coping strategies. The benefits were noted for mindfulness elements promoting self-compassion, self-actualization, intentionality of moving forward in life, and developing positivity or a sense of optimism. Other helpful elements were relaxation, self-care and reflection, self-awareness, self-control and focused thinking. Our findings show that incorporating mindfulness practices in interventions can be beneficial for promoting the healing and empowerment of immigrant women in abusive relationships.

TI  - A Randomized Control Trial Evaluating an Online Mindful Parenting Training for Mothers With Elevated Parental Stress
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The prevalence of maternal stress in early years of parenting can negatively impact child development. Therefore, there is a need for an early intervention that is easily accessible and low in costs. The current study examined the effectiveness of an 8-session online mindful parenting training for mothers with elevated levels of parental stress.Methods: A total of 76 mothers were randomized into an intervention (n = 43) or a waitlist control group (n = 33). The intervention group completed pretest assessment prior to the online intervention. Participants completed a post intervention assessment after the 10 weeks intervention and a follow-up assessment 10 weeks later. The waitlist group completed waitlist assessment, followed by a 10-week waitlist period. After these 10 weeks, a pretest assessment took place, after which the waitlist group participants also started the intervention, followed by the posttest assessment. Participating mothers completed questionnaires on parental stress (parent-child interaction problems, parenting problems, parental role restriction) and other maternal (over-reactive parenting discipline, self-compassion, symptoms of depression and anxiety) and child outcomes (aggressive behavior and emotional reactivity) while the non-participating parents (father or another mother) were asked to also report on child outcomes.Results: The online mindful parenting intervention was shown to be significantly more effective at a 95% level than a waitlist period with regard to over-reactive parenting discipline and symptoms of depression and anxiety (small and medium effect sizes), and significantly more effective at a 90% level with regard to self-compassion, and mother-rated child aggressive behavior and child emotional reactivity (small effect sizes). The primary outcome, parental stress, was found to have a 95% significant within-group effect only for the subscale parental role restriction (delayed small effect size improvement at follow-up). No significant improvements on child outcomes were found for the non-participating parent.Conclusion: To conclude, the results provide first evidence that an online mindful parenting training may be an easily accessible and valuable intervention for mothers with elevated levels of parental stress.

TI  - Mindfulness-based therapy in adults with an autism spectrum disorder: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Research shows that depression and anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric concern in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of a modified MBT protocol (MBT-AS) in high-functioning adults with ASD. 42 participants were randomized into a 9-week MBT-AS training or a wait-list control group. Results showed a significant reduction in depression, anxiety and rumination in the intervention group, as opposed to the control group. Furthermore, positive affect increased in the intervention group, but not in the control group. Concluding, the present study is the first controlled trial to demonstrate that adults with ASD can benefit from MBT-AS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mindfulness-based lifestyle programs for the self-management of Parkinson's disease in Australia
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite emerging evidence suggesting positive outcomes of mindfulness training for the self-management of other neurodegenerative diseases, limited research has explored its effect on the self-management of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to characterize the experiences of individuals participating in a facilitated, group mindfulness-based lifestyle program for community living adults with Stage 2 PD and explore how the program influenced beliefs about self-management of their disease. Our longitudinal qualitative study was embedded within a randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a 6-week mindfulness-based lifestyle program on patient-reported function. The study was set in Melbourne, Australia in 2012-2013. We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants before, immediately after, and 6 months following participation in the program. Sixteen participants were interviewed prior to commencing the program. Of these, 12 were interviewed shortly after its conclusion, and 9 interviewed at 6 months. Prior to the program, participants felt a lack of control over their illness. A desire for control and a need for alternative tools for managing the progression of PD motivated many to engage with the program. Following the program, where participants experienced an increase in mindfulness, many became more accepting of disease progression and reported improved social relationships and self-confidence in managing their disease. Mindfulness-based life-style programs have the potential for increasing both participants' sense of control over their reactions to disease symptoms as well as social connectedness. Community-based mindfulness training may provide participants with tools for self-managing a number of the consequences of Stage 2 PD.

TI  - Peace of Mind and Organizational Citizenship Behavior <i>The Mediating Effect of Loving Kindness</i>
T2  - ARCHIVE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION-ARCHIV FUR RELIGIONSPSYCHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Thai company organizes a weekly sermon and meditation session for its clients and members. We hypothesized that vipassana meditation's positive effects in work would be manifested in peace of mind, loving kindness, and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), that peace of mind would predict OCB, and that loving kindness would mediate the relationship of peace of mind to OCB. Peace of mind is operationally defined as the experience of inner peace and harmony; loving kindness as the thoughts, words, and acts of kindness extended to all creatures; and OCB as individual behavior that involves courtesy, civic virtue, sportsmanship, conscientiousness, and altruism. We conducted a study among 147 vipassana meditation participants; the results supported the hypotheses. Participants' peace of mind predicted OCB and loving kindness significantly mediated the peace of mind-OCB relationship. The beneficial effects of vipassana meditation suggest its adoption by organizations to foster efficient functioning.

TI  - The impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on psychological health among patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19 outbreak lockdown
T2  - BENI-SUEF UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe emergence of COVID-19 has spurred a wide range of psychological morbidities. However, its influence on a vulnerable population with chronic conditions is less addressed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychological health among patients with chronic diseases during the elevated psychiatric distress associated with the outbreak and examine the efficacy and feasibility of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention (MBSR). The study involved 149 participants recruited from university hospital outpatient clinics. Patients were allocated into two groups: MBSR training program and control group. Standardized questionnaires were administered to assess depression, anxiety and stress prior to the MBSR program and at completion of the training after 8 weeks.ResultsThe results showed that MBSR intervention improved psychological distress and decreased the mean scores of depression, anxiety and stress.ConclusionsMindfulness training program based on audio and smartphone was feasible and effective when it was applied to patients with chronic diseases and showed positive impact on negative psychological stress domains. These findings pave the way for the integration of psychological support for patients with chronic illnesses in clinical settings.

TI  - Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and treatment as usual in bipolar disorder
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDespite multiple pharmacological interventions, many people with bipolar disorder (BD) experience substantial residual mood symptoms, even in the absence of severe mood episodes, which have a negative impact on the course of illness and quality of life. Limited data are available on how to optimize treatment for BD, especially for those who suffer from persistent and residual depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a psychological treatment option for BD. This study aims to investigate whether adding MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) will result in symptomatic and functional improvements in adults with BD compared to TAU alone.Methods/designThis study is a prospective, evaluator blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of MBCT + TAU and TAU alone in 160 adults with bipolar type I and type II. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), mid-treatment (Tmid), and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), 12 (T4), and 15 (T5) months follow-up. Primary outcome is post-treatment severity of depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician administered). Secondary outcomes are severity of (hypo) manic symptoms, anxiety, relapse rates, overall functioning, positive mental health, and cost-effectiveness. As possible mediators will be assessed rumination of negative affect, dampening and rumination of positive affect, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion.DiscussionThis study will provide valuable insight into the (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT on clinician- and self-rated symptoms of BD, relapse rates, positive mental health, and overall functioning.Trial registrationNCT03507647.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study assessed the potential effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of a tailored mindfulness-based intervention (MBI, REMIND 2.0) for personal recovery among people with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsIn this pilot mixed methods randomized controlled trial, participants were assigned to either the MBI (n = 14) or the relaxation training (RT) (n = 14). Quantitative measures were used to assess primary outcomes, including personal recovery, mindfulness, self-compassion, resilience, and secondary outcomes, including depression, stress, anxiety, positive and negative moods, quality of life and general health at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and one-month follow-up (T2). Quantitative interviews were conducted to explore the experiences and perceptions toward the MBI.ResultsResults indicated significant group and time interactions for all outcomes except anxiety and stress. MBI participants showed significant improvements in all outcomes at T1, which were maintained at T2, except for positive mood. RT participants showed a significant decline in resilience but significant improvements in all secondary outcomes at T1, but all outcomes significantly declined at T2, except for anxiety and stress. MBI participants were receptive toward the programme in all aspects of personal recovery.ConclusionsThe tailored MBI is a potentially effective, feasible and acceptable approach to facilitate personal recovery among people with mental illness. Differences between MBI and RT are discussed.

TI  - Effect of remote mindfulness-based interventions on symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is high worldwide, and patients with COPD commonly suffer from mood disorders, such as symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, it is difficult to communicate with patients face to face to solve these psychological problems in the case of the fluctuations in symptoms of COPD and COVID-19 prevalence, which may lead to the fact that patients with COPD are more likely to suffer exacerbations, frequent readmissions and worse survival. Mindfulness-based interventions are a stress-reducing therapy with mindfulness at its core. Remote mindfulness-based interventions combine the advantages of high availability, accessibility, low cost and anonymity and can solve the barriers to access that many patients face when attending face-to-face programmes. Therefore, remote mindfulness-based interventions may be an effective way to improve the mental health of patients with COPD. Methods and analysis We will search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, PsycNET, MEDLINE, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection and Web of Science to select eligible studies that were published. The eligible studies will be screened, extracted and then the methodological quality will be evaluated independently by two reviewers. Review manager software V.5.3 software and Stata V.14.0 software will be used for meta-analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for a systematic review protocol. Findings of the proposed systematic review will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021265286.

T2  - PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to compare dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and positive psychotherapy (PPT) effects on perceived stress (PS) and quality of life (QOL) among patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Seventy six eligible patients with a Rome- IV diagnosis were randomly allocated in DBT (n = 18), MBCT (n = 20), PPT (n = 18), and control groups (n = 20). All the patients were evaluated for PS by perceived stress scale (PSS) and QOL by irritable bowel syndrome quality of life (IBS-QOL) on the studied groups at the time of their inclusion in the study and 8 weeks after it. Each of the intervention groups took part in 8 group sessions. Conversely, the control group were evaluated without any intervention. 46 female and 27 male in 4 groups completed the study. The results showed significant differences between the groups based on the variables of the PSS and IBS-QOL (p < 0.05). In addition, levels of PS were significantly lower for the MBCT intervention compared with the other groups; besides, the significant effects of the QOL variables represented the higher scores of the PPT compared to the treatment groups. The interventions could not be generalized to other samples. Some other limitations included the lack of conducting a follow-up plan. This study provides initial evidence that MBCT and PPT are more effective than other treatment groups on PS decrease and QOL improvement among patients with IBS, respectively.

TI  - Mindfulness Based Flourishing Program: A Cross-Cultural Study of Hong Kong Chinese and British Participants
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mindfulness Based Flourishing Program (MBFP) is an online 8-week intervention developed for enhancing wellbeing with the use of mindfulness practices, through targeting a range of positive variables. The efficacy of the MBFP has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial, and in order to further establish it as an intervention with widespread application, cross-cultural validation is warranted. The current study was conducted with the primary aim of testing the validity of the MBFP with a Hong Kong Chinese population, as well as verifying its positive effects. A randomized wait-list controlled design was adopted with 115 participants (92 females, mean age=31.50). Intervention outcomes were compared between Hong Kong Chinese and British participants. Five positive variables were examined (self-compassion, meaning in life, positive and negative emotions, gratitude, and mindfulness), and measures were taken pre- and post-intervention. Significant gains in wellbeing measures were observed in both the Hong Kong Chinese and the British experimental groups. Levels of wellbeing post-intervention were also higher for the two experimental groups as compared to their control counterparts. The current study provides preliminary evidence for the MBFP's cross-cultural validity, and strengthens previous claims for its efficacy as a new, accessible alternative for enhancing wellbeing.

TI  - Does mindfulness matter in the development of character strengths? A RCT study comparing mindfulness-based strengths practice and character strengths-based intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Character strengths-based interventions (CSBI) take various forms and integrate different ingredients into interventions. This study investigated the role of mindfulness in strengths development, directly comparing the effects of mindfulness-based strengths practice (MBSP) and a form of CSBI without mindfulness. Ninety-five participants were randomly assigned to MBSP, CSBI, and blank control groups. Participants' mindfulness, character strengths, strengths knowledge, strengths use, psychological well-being (PWB), and subjective well-being (SWB) were assessed before and after the intervention, and one month later. The results showed that MBSP and CSBI were equally effective in enhancing character strengths, strengths knowledge, and strengths use. MBSP was more effective in promoting mindfulness, PWB, and overall character strengths, while CSBI was more effective in enhancing participants' SWB. The development of strengths knowledge and strengths use served as serial mediators of the increase in character strengths, and the development of mindfulness served as the mediator of the increase in PWB.

TI  - Effect of online mindfulness-based physical exercise program on psychological well-being and life satisfaction during the Covid-19 pandemic
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based physical exercise program on university students' psychological well-being and life satisfaction. In the study, a randomized control group pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test design was used. The study group consisted of 60 students (30 in an experimental group and 30 in a control group) continuing their education in different faculties of a foundation university during the Covid-19 pandemic in Turkey. A personal information questionnaire, Psychological Well-Being Scale and Life Satisfaction Scale were used to collect the study data. The Mindfulness-Based Physical Exercise Program was implemented in the experimental group, once a week for 8 sessions. The results suggested significant differences between the psychological well-being and life satisfaction post-test scores of the experimental and control groups in favor of the experimental group. In the sub-dimensions of psychological well-being, significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups in post-test scores of environmental mastery, personal growth, and purpose in life. There was no significant difference between the psychological well-being, positive relationships with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance sub-dimensions except personal growth sub-dimensions, and life satisfaction post-test and follow-up test scores of the university students in the experimental group. In the post-test comparisons of two groups, a significant difference was found between total psychological well-being, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, and self-acceptance, in favor of the experimental group.

TI  - A Pragmatic Controlled Trial of a Brief Yoga and Mindfulness-Based Program for Psychological and Occupational Health in Education Professionals
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To examine changes in psychological and occupational wellbeing in education professionals that attended a brief yoga and mindfulness-based program.Design: Pragmatic controlled trial comparing education professionals that attended a yoga mindfulness-based program (n = 9) to a waitlist control group (n = 22).Setting: The 3-day program was delivered at the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health in Massachusetts. Intervention: The 3-day yoga mindfulness program included 5 hours per day of yoga, mindfulness exercises, formal meditation, didactic, and experiential activities.Main Outcome Measures: Measures of psychological and occupational wellbeing were completed before (baseline), immediately after (post-program), and two months after the program (follow-up). Results: Relative to controls (n = 21), the RISE group (n = 9) showed significant improvements in positive affect (p = .033), negative affect (p = .044), mindfulness (p = .001), empowerment (p = .022), self-compassion (p = .001), and work engagement from baseline to post-program. From baseline to follow-up, the RISE group showed significant improvements in stress (p = .008), negative affect (p = .013), mindfulness (p = .001), empowerment (p = .007), and self-compassion (p = .001) compared to the control group.Conclusions: The yoga mindfulness program was associated with improvements in educators' psychological and occupational wellbeing immediately following and 2-months following the program. Future research with a larger sample size is needed to confirm these results.

TI  - "I had a sort of epiphany!' An exploratory study of group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for older people with depression
T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been successful in reducing depressive symptoms in people with chronic-recurrent depression. However, the research evaluating the efficacy of this approach, and other innovative treatments for mood disorders, has mainly been with people under 65 years. This paper aims to help redress this imbalance by exploring older people's own reflections of their experience of MBCT.Methods: A qualitative approach was used to explore 13 participants' experiences of MBCT; participants were interviewed pre and post-intervention and again after six months. To see whether the standard course requires any adaptations for older participants, the two MBCT course facilitators were interviewed post-intervention.Results: Thematic analysis identified five overarching themes and showed that older people reported positive changes in their mental health and well-being and reported being released from the past'. The facilitators reported that they needed to be aware of later life issues, such as loneliness and potential physical limitations, but otherwise only minor adaptations were needed to the standard MBCT course for older people.Conclusion: MBCT is an acceptable approach for people aged 65 years and over and further research should explore potential mechanisms of change including changes in meta-cognitive awareness and self-compassion.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Intervention for People With Dementia and Their Partners: Results of a Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Studies have shown preliminary support for mindfulness-based interventions benefitting people with dementia and their caregivers. However, most studies focus on these two groups separately. This study examined whether it would be possible and beneficial for people with dementia and their caregiver to jointly undergo an adjusted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, named TANDEM.Methods: The 8-week MBSR training was adjusted based on a literature review and interviews with experts (clinicians and mindfulness trainers). Seven couples (a person with early-stage dementia and their caregiver) participated together in the 8-week TANDEM program. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted after completion. Questionnaires (administered before and after the intervention) assessed the primary outcomes of quality of life and psychological distress (stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes were mindfulness, self-compassion, positive mental health, worrying, and perceived burden (for caregivers).Results: All participants completed the program and reported beneficial effects (relaxation, awareness, acceptance, and resilience). Most managed to integrate exercises into their daily lives and planned to continue their practice. Participating in a group was considered valuable and supportive. Furthermore, it was appreciated that participants could follow the training together (as a couple). The quantitative results showed a small effect on increased quality of life for caregivers. No substantial decrease in psychological distress was apparent. Caregivers displayed a large increase in mindfulness.Conclusion: The results of this mixed-methods study suggest that an adjusted mindfulness program is feasible and well-received among couples of persons with early-stage dementia and their caregiver, warranting further research in this area.

TI  - A Small Randomized Pilot Study of a Workplace Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Surgical Intensive Care Unit Personnel: Effects on Salivary α-Amylase Levels
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine whether a workplace stress-reduction intervention decreases reactivity to stress among personnel exposed to a highly stressful occupational environment. Methods: Personnel from a surgical intensive care unit were randomized to a stress-reduction intervention or a waitlist control group. The 8-week group mindfulness-based intervention included mindfulness, gentle yoga, and music. Psychological and biological markers of stress were measured 1 week before and 1 week after the intervention. Results: Levels of salivary alpha-amylase, an index of sympathetic activation, were significantly decreased between the first and second assessments in the intervention group with no changes in the control group. There was a positive correlation between salivary alpha-amylase levels and burnout scores. Conclusions: These data suggest that this type of intervention could decrease not only reactivity to stress but also the risk of burnout.

TI  - The Effect of Pranayamic Breathing as a Positive Psychology Exercise on Foreign Language Learning Anxiety and Test Anxiety Among Language Learners at Tertiary Level
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the impact of pranayamic breathing (PB) as a positive psychology exercise on mitigating foreign language anxiety (FLLA) and test anxiety (TA) of undergraduate English students studying at a Turkish university. Additionally, the study examined the effects of PB on academic achievement in listening and reading comprehension skills of the participants as well as exploring learners' and their instructor's perceptions of using PB techniques in their classrooms. The sample consisted of 140 sophomore English language learners. Two intact classes, each comprising 70 participants, were selected as the experimental and the control group using convenience sampling. Two basic PB techniques, Nadi Shodhana Pranayama and Bhramari Pranayama, were implemented to the experimental group on a weekly basis for a total of 7 weeks. In this mixed-method study, the quantitative data were gathered using English Language Learning Anxiety Scale, Foreign Language Test Anxiety Scale, and listening and reading achievement pre- and post-tests, while the qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews, and the teacher's reflective journal. The findings revealed that the implementation of positive psychology technique of pranayama breathing mitigated the FLLA and TA levels significantly and also improved listening and reading comprehension skills of the participants to a considerable extent. The findings also demonstrated that both the students and their instructor perceived PB implementation as a useful and a practical medium in alleviating the anxious feelings, promoting the general class atmosphere and regulating daily habits despite the implementational challenges shared by the instructor.

TI  - Classic Psychedelic Use and Current Meditation Practice
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesPrevious research has investigated potential synergies between classic psychedelics and meditation practice, but relatively little remains known about the relationship between classic psychedelic experiences and engagement with meditation practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between classic psychedelic experiences and engagement with two popular types of meditation: mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness or compassion meditation.MethodThis retrospective, population-based observational study included 2822 respondents aged 18 years or older in the United States. Using covariate-adjusted regression models, this study examined associations of classic psychedelic experiences with current practice of mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness or compassion meditation.ResultsIn covariate-adjusted regression models, lifetime classic psychedelic use was associated with a higher frequency of current mindfulness meditation practice but not current loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice. Both psychological insight and "ego dissolution" were associated with a higher frequency of current mindfulness meditation practice and current loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice. Notably, when psychological insight and "ego dissolution" were entered into the regression model simultaneously, only greater psychological insight was associated with having a higher frequency of current mindfulness meditation practice and current loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice.ConclusionsAlthough the findings in this study cannot demonstrate causality, they suggest that classic psychedelic experiences may exert a positive effect on the cultivation and maintenance of health-related behaviors such as regular meditation practice, with psychological insight appearing to be a stronger predictor than "ego dissolution."PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.

TI  - Loving-kindness meditation for chronic low back pain: results from a pilot trial.
T2  - Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - PURPOSE: Loving-kindness meditation has been used for centuries in the Buddhist tradition to develop love and transform anger into compassion. This pilot study tested an 8-week loving-kindness program for chronic low back pain patients.METHOD: Patients (N = 43) were randomly assigned to the intervention or standard care. Standardized measures assessed patients' pain, anger, and psychological distress.FINDINGS: Post and follow-up analyses showed significant improvements in pain and psychological distress in the loving-kindness group, but no changes in the usual care group. Multilevel analyses of daily data showed that more loving-kindness practice on a given day was related to lower pain that day and lower anger the next day.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results suggest that the loving-kindness program can be beneficial in reducing pain, anger, and psychological distress in patients with persistent low back pain.IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians may find loving-kindness meditation helpful in the treatment of patients with persistent pain.

TI  - Emergency Department Nurses' Experiences of a Mindfulness Training Intervention: A Phenomenological Exploration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOLISTIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore emergency care nurses' experiences of an intervention to increase compassion and empathy and reduce stress through individual mindfulness training delivered via workshops and a smartphone application. We also explored how the nurses felt about the practical and technical aspects of the intervention. Design: Qualitative interview study. Method: Individual interviews were conducted with eight of the 56 participants in the intervention study and used phenomenological analysis to illuminate how they made sense of their lived experiences of mindfulness training. Findings: Three themes illuminated the nurses' experiences: becoming aware, changing through mindfulness, and gaining the tools for mindfulness through workshops and the mobile application. The first two themes expressed personal experiences, whereas the third expressed experiences of the practical and technical aspects of the intervention. Most nurses found the mobile application easy to use and effective. Conclusions: Emergency care nurses can feel that the awareness and changes that come with mindfulness training benefit them, their colleagues, and the patients for whom they care. The findings also provide insights into the challenges of practicing mindfulness in a busy emergency care setting and into the practical aspects of using a smartphone application to train mindfulness.

AB  - Psychological concerns in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) patients represent an important issue and should be addressed through non-pharmacological treatments. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on psychological variables and the perspectives and experiences of patients with an SSc diagnosis. Notably, 32 SSc patients were enrolled and assigned to either the intervention (MBSR) group or the waitlist group. Inclusion criteria were (i) age ≥ 18 years, SSc diagnosis according to EULAR/ACR diagnostic criteria and informed consent. Exclusion criteria were previous participation in any Mind-Body Therapy or psychiatric diagnosis. Quantitative and qualitative outcomes were investigated through clinometric questionnaires and individual interviews. MBSR did not significantly impact outcomes such as physical functionality, anxiety, hopelessness, depression, physical health status, perceived stress, mindfulness and mental health status. For the anger evaluation, statistically significant differences are found for both controlling and expressing anger, indicating that the MBSR program had a favorable impact. As for qualitative results, more awareness of daily activities, stress reduction in terms of recognizing the causes and implementing self-strategies to prevent them, adherence to therapy, and recognition of the effect of medication on their bodies were reported. In conclusion, it is important to highlight the absence of negative or side effects of the MBSR program and the positive impact on patients' experience and perspective; thus, we suggest this approach should be taken into account for SSc patients.

TI  - The Temporal Order of Change in Daily Mindfulness and Affect During Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in mindfulness are assumed to lead to improvements in psychological well-being during mindfulness-based treatments. However, the temporal order of this association has received little attention. This intensive longitudinal study examines whether within-person changes in mindfulness precede or follow changes in negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) during a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) program. This study also examines interindividual differences in the association between mindfulness and affect and possible predictors of these differences. Mindfulness, NA, and PA were assessed on a daily basis in 83 individuals from the general population who participated in an MBSR program. Multilevel autoregressive models were used to investigate the temporal order of changes in mindfulness and affect. Day-to-day changes in mindfulness predicted subsequent day-to-day changes in both NA and PA, but reverse associations did not emerge. Thus, changes in mindfulness seem to precede rather than to follow changes in affect during MBSR. The magnitude of the effects differed substantially between individuals, showing that the strength of the relationship between mindfulness and affect is not the same for all participants. These between-subjects differences could not be explained by gender, age, level of education, average level of mindfulness home practice, or baseline levels of mindfulness and affect. Mindfulness home practice during the day did predict subsequent increases in mindfulness. The findings suggest that increasing mindfulness on a daily basis can be a beneficial means to improve daily psychological well-being.

TI  - Healthcare Workers' Well-Being: A Systematic Review of Positive Psychology Interventions
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Given persistent occupational stressors and multiple challenges in the delivery of healthcare, there is an increased focus on the well-being of healthcare workers. Responding to these challenges will require a multipronged approach, focusing on system level, organization, and individual actions. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) represent a promising area for individual action. This systematic review indicates that PPI, delivered via many methods, holds promise for improving the well-being of healthcare workers, although there is a clear need for additional randomized controlled trials utilizing defined and standardized outcome measures. In this review, the most commonly evaluated PPIs were mindfulness-based or gratitude -based interventions. These were delivered via different methods, with many administered in the workplace and commonly in the form of courses ranging from two days to eight weeks. Researchers documented measurable improvements in multiple studied outcomes, noting reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, burnout, and stress. Some interventions increased well-being, job and life satisfaction, self -compassion, relaxation, and resilience. Most studies emphasized that these are simple, accessible, low-cost interventions. Limitations included some nonrandomized or quasi-experimental designs, alongside generally small sample sizes and varying methods of intervention delivery. Another concern is the lack of standardized outcome assessments and long-term follow-up data. As almost all studies included were performed before the pandemic, further research will be required post-pandemic. Overall, however, PPI shows promise as one arm of a multipronged approach to improving the well-being of healthcare workers.

TI  - Exploring the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention in university students: MindKinder adult version program (MK-A)
T2  - EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the mindfulness-based intervention MindKinder Adult version (MK-A) program on dispositional mindfulness, trait emotional intelligence, mental health, and emotional regulation difficulties in university students. A quasi-experimental design of repeated measures pretest-posttest with a control group was used. The sample consisted of 137 university students (67.9% women, with a mean age of 19.94 years). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 69) and the control group (n = 68). Results showed that the program stimulated a significant improvement in dispositional mindfulness, describing, non-reactivity, trait emotional intelligence, mental health and emotional confusion in the experi-mental group. Given the obtained results, we consider the importance and incorporation of these mindfulness-based programs in university students. Due to the general characteristics of this population, having resources that lead to improvements, such as those obtained in this study, can be of great help since, in general, we find ourselves in a context, the university, in which students are subject to high levels of stress and anxiety. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - The Use of Modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Program for Family Caregivers of People Living with Dementia: A Feasibility Study
T2  - ASIAN NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) program for reducing the stress, depressive symptoms, and subjective burden of family caregivers of people with dementia (PWD).Methods: A prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design was adopted. Fifty-seven participants were recruited from the community and randomized into either the modified MBSR group (n = 27) or modified MBCT group (n = 26), receiving seven face-to-face intervention sessions for more than 16 weeks. Various psychological outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), immediately after intervention (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2).Results: Both interventions were found to be feasible in view of the high attendance (more than 70.0%) and low attrition (3.8%) rates. The mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed positive within-group effects on perceived stress (p =.030, Cohen's d = 0.54), depressive symptoms (p =.002, Cohen's d = 0.77), and subjective caregiver burden (p <.001, Cohen's d = 1.12) in both interventions across the time points, whereas the modified MBCT had a larger effect on stress reduction, compared with the modified MBSR (p =.019).Conclusion: Both the modified MBSR and MBCT are acceptable to family caregivers of PWD. Their preliminary effects were improvements in stress, depressive symptoms, and subjective burden. The modified MBCT may be more suitable for caregivers of PWD than the MBSR. A future clinical trial is needed to confirm their effectiveness in improving the psychological well-being of caregivers of PWD. (C) 2020 Korean Society of Nursing Science. Published by Elsevier BV.

TI  - Effects of a trauma-informed mindful recovery program on comorbid pain, anxiety, and substance use during primary care buprenorphine treatment: A proof-of-concept study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA mindfulness-based intervention that reduces comorbid pain, anxiety, and substance use during office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) could enhance retention and prevent overdose. We conducted a pilot study of the Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC), a 24-week trauma-informed program with a motivationally-sensitive curriculum. MethodsPatients prescribed buprenorphine (N = 18) enrolled in M-ROCC. We collected urine toxicology biweekly. At 0, 4, and 24 weeks, participants completed PROMIS-Pain, PROMIS-Anxiety, Mindfulness (FFMQ), Experiential Avoidance (BEAQ), Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and Self-Compassion (SCS-SF) scales. We estimated changes over time using mixed models. Participants completed qualitative interviews at 4 and 24 weeks. ResultsPositive urine toxicology decreased over time for cocaine (beta = -.266, p = .008) and benzodiazepines (beta = -.208, p = .028). M-ROCC reduced PROMIS-Pain (Z = -2.29; p = .022), BEAQ (Z = -2.83; p = .0005), and increased FFMQ (Z = 3.51; p < .001), MAIA (Z = 3.40; p = .001), and SCS-SF (Z = 2.29; p = .022). Participants with co-morbid anxiety had decreased PROMIS-Anxiety (Z = -2.53; p = .012). Interviewed participants commonly used mindfulness practices for stress and anxiety (12/12, 100%), and to reduce pain catastrophizing and rumination (7/12, 58%). Conclusion and Scientific SignificanceThis is the first study to report the effects of a 24-week mindfulness program during buprenorphine treatment on common comorbidities, including pain interference, anxiety, cocaine, and benzodiazepine use. The findings that M-ROCC is associated with reduced experiential avoidance, as well as increased interoceptive awareness and self-compassion, align with proposed mechanisms that are now extended to OUD treatment. Future larger randomized controlled trials are needed before effectiveness can be established and the role of these mechanisms can be confirmed.

TI  - A mindfulness parent well-being course: evaluation of outcomes for parents of children with autism and related disabilities recruited through special schools
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Parents of children with intellectual disabilities and/or autism have been shown to experience higher levels of distress than other parents. Despite such data having been available for several decades, the evidence base for psychological interventions to support parental well-being is small. Recent data suggest that both mindfulness and acceptance processes are associated with decreased psychological distress for parents of children with intellectual disability and/or autism. In addition, some controlled evaluations of mindfulness-based interventions for these parents have resulted in positive outcomes for mothers in particular. In the present study 18 mothers and 3 fathers were recruited via special schools who then attended a Mindfulness Based Well-Being for Parents (MBW-P) group over eight weeks. Parents completed questionnaire measures before and at the end of the course. Statistical analysis showed significant reported increases in mindfulness and self-compassion, and reduced general stress. Parents also reported reductions in anxiety and depression, although these changes were not statistically significant. No significant reductions in their child's behaviour problems or increases in the child's prosocial behaviour were found. Parents also reported high levels of satisfaction with the course. These preliminary data suggest that further research studies testing the effectiveness of the MBW-P course are warranted.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on posttraumatic growth of Chinese breast cancer survivors
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) patients in China suffered from a variety of psychology stress such as perceived stress and anxiety, posttraumatic growth (PTG) as a positive factor could promote their psychology health and quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on promoting PTG, decreasing perceived stress and anxiety of Chinese BC patients. A randomized controlled trial of 60 BC patients (Stages I-III) was conducted. They were randomly divided to the 8-week MBSR group or usual care (UC) group. PTG inventory, Perceived Stress Scale of Chinese version (CPSS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) evaluated the PTG level, perceived stress and anxiety at three times(before intervention-T1, after intervention-T2 and follow up at 3 months-T3). A repeated-measures analysis of variance model was used to compare each outcome measure of two groups at the three times. There was one patient discontinued the intervention and one lose to follow up in MBSR group, finally 58 BC patients completed the research. There was no difference between two groups before the intervention. The results showed significant improvements in MBSR group comparing with the UC group that PTG level was much higher after the 8-week intervention and the follow up (F = 34.73, p<.00). At the same time, CPSS (F = 14.41, p<.00) and STAI (F = 15.24, p<.00) scores were significant decreased at T2 and T3. The results showed that MBSR promoted the level of PTG and decreased perceived stress and anxiety state of Chinese BC patients, and the results persisted at three months after intervention. The research preliminary proved that MBSR was suitable to Chinese BC patients. MBSR should be recommending to BC survivors in China.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindful self-compassion therapy on psychopathology symptoms, psychological distress and life expectancy in infertile women treated with in vitro fertilization: a two-arm double-blind parallel randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesInfertility is a prominent problem affecting millions of couples worldwide. Recently, there has been a hightened emphasis on elucidating the subtle linkages between infertility treatment leveraging assisted reproductive technology and the complex realm of psychological challenges, as well as efforts in implementation of psychological interventions.The Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program seeks to improve self-compassion, compassion for others, mindfulness, and life satisfaction while reducing depression, anxiety, and stress. In the current study, an MSC intervention was performed on infertile women (IW) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms and enhancing life expectancy.MethodsFifty-seven IW undergoing IVF were randomly allocated to two groups: MSC (n = 29) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 28). Participants in MSC met once a week for two hours for eight weeks and attended a half-day meditation retreat. The Synder's Hope questionnaire and the Revised 90-Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used as the primary outcome measures. Data were obtained before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and two months post-intervention. Repeated measures of ANCOVA and paired t-tests in all assessment points were used to compare the MSC and the TAU groups in outcomes.ResultsIn the MSC group, hopelessness, anger-hostility, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity difficulties, and depression were significantly reduced compared with the TAU group, and those improvements persisted at the two-month follow-up. Reliable change index revealed that the MSC group's gains were both clinically significant and durable.ConclusionsMSC can facilitate higher life satisfaction and mental well-being for IW undergoing IVF by reducing psychological distress, psychopathological symptoms, and hopelessness. These encouraging findings call for more research into the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies in addressing psychological problems among IW undergoing IVF.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based interventions on fatigue and psychological wellbeing in women with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Cancer diagnosis and treatment can cause fatigue, stress and anxiety which can have a detrimental effect on patients, families and the wider community. Mindfulness-based interventions appear to have positive effects on managing these cancer-related symptoms. Objective To investigate the efficacy of mindfulness on cancer related fatigue (CRF) and psychological well-being in female cancer patients. Methods Five databases (CINHAL, Ovid Medline, Ovid Psych Info, Scopus, and Cochrane), and two trial registers (WHO and Clinicaltrials.gov) were searched for randomised control trials from inception to April 2021 and updated in August 2022. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4. The standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine the intervention effect. Subgroup analysis was performed for adaptation to types of mindfulness, length of intervention and types of comparator used. Results Twenty-one studies with a total of 2326 participants were identified. Mindfulness significantly improved CRF (SMD -0.81, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.44), depression (SMD-0.74, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.39) and anxiety (SMD -0.92, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.33). No effect was observed for quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.13-0.87) and sleep (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.34-0.04). Subgroup analysis revealed that there was little difference in SMD for adapted type of mindfulness (p = 0.42), wait list control compared to active comparator (p = 0.05) or length of intervention (p = 0.29). Conclusion Mindfulness appears to be effective in reducing CRF and other cancer related symptoms in women. Adaptations to mindfulness delivery did not have negative impact on results which may aid delivery in the clinical settings.

TI  - Which facets of mindfulness are related to problematic eating among patients seeking bariatric surgery?
T2  - EATING BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been growing research indicating the potential positive benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for obesity, but few studies have examined the relationship of mindfulness processes to obesity-related behaviors, particularly among clinical populations such as bariatric surgery candidates. The current study examined the relationship of specific mindfulness facets to a variety of problematic eating behaviors assessed through diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of 820 patients seeking bariatric surgery. Results indicated that greater mindfulness on specific facets, particularly acting with awareness, was related to less binge and emotional eating. Greater mindfulness was also related, though less consistently, to less habitual overeating and grazing. The observing facet was generally unrelated to problematic eating, but in a few cases being more observant related to having greater eating problems. The results of the study and future directions are discussed in relation to research on problematic eating in obesity and mindfulness-based interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping the Affective Dimension of Embodiment With the Sensation Manikin: Validation Among Chronic Pain Patients and Modification by Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Mindfulness-based interventions target novel pain relief mechanisms not captured by legacy pain scales, including 1) cultivating awareness of pleasant and neutral sensations proximal to unpleasant sensations and 2) interoceptively mapping sensation location and spatial distribution. Methods We created a digital sensation manikin (SM) by overlaying a human figure silhouette with a grid of 469 "sensation" pixels. A series of five research questions examined the SM's discriminant validity, construct validity, incremental validity, convergence with an objective measure of pain attentional bias, and sensitivity to a mindfulness-based psychological treatment, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE). A sample of opioid treated chronic pain patients (n = 108; age, 53.79 (12.94) years; female, 65%) was recruited to answer research questions 1 to 5, and a sample of healthy controls (n = 91; age, 36.47 (13.50) years; female, 55%) was recruited as the comparison group for research question 1. Results Chronic pain patients reported significantly more unpleasant sensations than did healthy controls (p < .001, d = 1.23) and significantly fewer pleasant sensations (p = .001, d = 0.50). The SM also evidenced expected relationships with multiple measures of pain (r = 0.26-0.29) and well-being (r = -0.21 to 0.28), uniquely predicted pain interference (beta = -0.18), and exhibited a significant association with pain attentional bias (r = 0.25). Finally, mindfulness-based intervention via MORE significantly increased the ratio of pleasant to unpleasant sensations reported by chronic pain patients relative to an active control condition (p = .036, d = 0.51). Conclusions This study supports the SM's validity and indicates that assessing both pleasant and unpleasant sensations broadens the scope of pain measurement. Although the SM would benefit from further optimization, its continued use is likely to contribute to improved assessment and treatment options for chronic pain patients.

TI  - The Wheel of Mindfulness: a Generative Framework for Second-Generation Mindful Leadership
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of mindfulness research and programs, in the workplace and elsewhere, has been a matter of considerable ambiguity and contestation. Distinguishing between first-generation and second-generation mindfulness-based initiatives has been a useful and positive response to this uncertainty and controversy. Second-generation mindfulness interventions in leadership are defined as going beyond views of mindfulness as a means to reduce the stress inherent in continual change, and as instrumental support for organizational performance in an economy of attention. The purpose of this paper is to build on this work in two ways. Firstly, it acknowledges the contribution of first-generation psychological-therapeutic programs. Secondly, it highlights the value of extending the range and depth of Buddhist-derived interventions beyond such programs and most importantly, also capturing and exploring the value of critical and collective approaches to mindfulness that derive from other traditions and schools of thought. In order to guide such a progression, this paper presents a Wheel of Mindfulness model that captures the different, and inevitably selective, lenses on mindfulness, and provides a generative framework for exploring and building on sources of controversy and debate.

TI  - Positive Emotion Correlates of Meditation Practice: a Comparison of Mindfulness Meditation and Loving-Kindness Meditation
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to uncover the day-to-day emotional profiles and dose-response relations, both within persons and between persons, associated with initiating one of two meditation practices, either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation. Data were pooled across two studies of midlife adults (N = 339) who were randomized to learn either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation in a 6-week workshop. The duration and frequency of meditation practice was measured daily for 9 weeks, commencing with the first workshop session. Likewise, positive and negative emotions were also measured daily, using the modified Differential Emotions Scale (Fredrickson, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 47:1-53, 2013). Analysis of daily emotion reports over the targeted 9-week period showed significant gains in positive emotions and no change in negative emotions, regardless of meditation type. Multilevel models also revealed significant dose-response relations between duration of meditation practice and positive emotions, both within persons and between persons. Moreover, the within-person dose-response relation was stronger for loving-kindness meditation than for mindfulness meditation. Similar dose-response relations were observed for the frequency of meditation practice. In the context of prior research on the mental and physical health benefits produced by subtle increases in day-to-day experiences of positive emotions, the present research points to evidence-based practices-both mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation-that can improve emotional well-being.

TI  - MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY FOR SEVERELY FATIGUED MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS: A WAITING LIST CONTROLLED STUDY
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Fatigue is the most common symptom in multiple sclerosis. Evidence-based treatment options are scarce.Objective: To study the feasibility and potential effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in severely fatigued multiple sclerosis patients.Methods: Non-randomized pilot study with a waiting list control period including 59 multiple sclerosis patients with severe fatigue. Primary outcome measure: fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength-20. Secondary measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Life Satisfaction Questionnaire, subscale sleep of the Symptom Checklist-90, Cognitive Failure Questionnaire, Fatigue Catastrophizing Scale, Coping Inventory of Stressful Situations, and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form. Measurements were taken before treatment (double baseline), after treatment, and at follow-up (3 months).Results: Adherence rate was 71%. Eight out of 10 participants who completed the intervention were satisfied with the intervention. Significant time effects were found for 7 out of 11 outcome measures (p = 0.006 to < 0.001). The effect size was moderate for all outcome measures that were significant posttreatment and/or at follow-up (eta(2)= 0.10-0.17). Improvements were maintained at follow-up. Of the completers, 46% showed a clinically relevant change regarding fatigue.Conclusion: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is feasible in severely fatigued multiple sclerosis patients and has positive results in the reduction of severe fatigue and several psychological factors.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the benefits of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological function among breast cancer (BC) survivors
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychological issue is the most common co-morbidity of women with breast cancer (BC) after receiving treatment. Effective coping with this problem is significant importance. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the benefits of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological distress among breast cancer survivors.PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from their inception to June 30, 2014. Two reviewers independently reviewed and extracted the data. The primary outcomes of interest were psychological domains. Review Manager 5.3 was used to pool collected data.Nine articles involving 964 participants were identified. Compared with those in control group, patients in MBSR group have a significant improvement on psychological domains: depression [mean difference (MD), 5.09; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 3.63-6.55; P < 0.00001], anxiety (MD, 2.79; 95 % CI, 1.62-3.96; P < 0.00001), stress (MD, 4.10; 95 % CI, 2.46-5.74; P < 0.00001). MBSR can also improve the overall quality of life (QOL) (MD, -1.16; 95 % CI, -2.21 to -0.12; P = 0.03).On the basis of our findings, MBSR shows a positive effect on psychological function and QOL of breast cancer survivors. This approach can be recommended to breast cancer patients as a part of their rehabilitation.

TI  - Mindfulness based cognitive therapy versus treatment as usual in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often present with a lifelong pattern of core symptoms that is associated with impairments of functioning in daily life. This has a substantial personal and economic impact. In clinical practice there is a high need for additional or alternative interventions for existing treatments, usually consisting of pharmacotherapy and/or psycho-education. Although previous studies show preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing ADHD symptoms and improving executive functioning, these studies have methodological limitations. This study will take account of these limitations and will examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in further detail.Methods/design: A multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial will be conducted in N = 120 adults with ADHD. Patients will be randomised to MBCT in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments will take place at baseline and at three, six and nine months after baseline. Primary outcome measure will be severity of ADHD symptoms rated by a blinded clinician. Secondary outcome measures will be self-reported ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, positive mental health and general functioning. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted.Discussion: This trial will offer valuable information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBCT in addition to TAU compared to TAU alone in adults swith ADHD.

TI  - A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study of the Acceptability and Effectiveness of a Brief Meditation and Mindfulness Intervention for People with Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease
T2  - BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions can successfully target negative perseverative cognitions such as worry and thought suppression, but their acceptability and effectiveness in people with long-term conditions is uncertain. We therefore pilot tested a six-week meditation and mindfulness intervention in people (n = 40) with diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. We used a sequential mixed-methods approach that measured change in worry and thought suppression and qualitatively explored acceptability, feasibility, and user experience with a focus group (n = 11) and in-depth interviews (n = 16). The intervention was highly acceptable, with 90% completing >= 5 sessions. Meditation and mindfulness skills led to improved sleep, greater relaxation, and more-accepting approaches to illness and illness experience. At the end of the six-week meditation course, worry, and thought suppression were significantly reduced. Positive impacts of mindfulness-based interventions on psychological health may relate to acquisition and development of meta-cognitive skills but this needs experimental confirmation.

TI  - Does Loving-Kindness Meditation Reduce Anxiety? Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has shown some promise as a psychological intervention, little is known about the effectiveness of LKM for reducing one of the most prevalent mental health problems: anxiety. To build knowledge in this area, we conducted a randomized controlled trial, assigning non-clinical undergraduates to either a four-session, group-based LKM intervention (n = 38) or a waitlist control (n = 33). Self-reported anxiety, compassionate love, and self-compassion were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 8-week follow-up. Relative to control participants, participants in the LKM intervention reported higher compassionate love and self-compassion at posttreatment and higher self-kindness (a component of self-compassion) at follow-up. Anxiety ratings did not significantly differ between conditions at posttreatment or follow-up. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Interest in mindfulness as a tool to improve health and well-being has increased rapidly over the past two decades. Limited qualitative research has been conducted on mindfulness and health. This study utilized in-depth interviews to explore the context, perceptions, and experiences of a sub-set of participants engaged in an acceptability study of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) among urban youth. Content analysis revealed that all in-depth interview participants reported experiencing some form of positive benefit and enhanced self-awareness as a result of MBSR program participation. Significant variation in the types and intensity of changes occurring was identified, ranging from a reframing and reduction of daily stressors to transformational shifts in life orientation and well-being. Variations in perceptions of and experiences with mindfulness should be studied in further depth in the context of prospective intervention research, including their potentially differential influence on mental and physical health outcomes.

TI  - Mindfulness and Rehabilitation: Teaching Yoga and Meditation to Young Men in an Alternative to Incarceration Program
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used participant/observation and open-ended interviews to understand how male participants (age 18-24 years) benefited from yoga and mindfulness training within an Alternative to Incarceration (ATI) program. Findings suggest that the male participants (age 18-24 years) benefited from the intervention through reductions in stress and improvements in emotion regulation. Several participants noted the importance of the development of an embodied practice for assisting them in managing anger and impulse control. The young men's narratives suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can contribute positively to rehabilitative outcomes within alternative to incarcerations settings, providing complementary benefit to existing ATI programs, especially for clients amenable to mindfulness training. With many jurisdictions expanding rehabilitation-focused interventions for young offenders, service providers should consider the potential positive contributions that mindfulness-based interventions can have for fostering desistance and reducing recidivism among justice system-involved populations.

TI  - Mindfulness for human-centred digital learning
T2  - ARGENTINIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing from a decade of informed exploration, educational research and personal practice, this reflective article discusses the construct of mindfulness and its application in digital learning, including language learning. Latest discoveries in neuroscience and scientific research in mindfulness, have bridged the science and practice of mindfulness providing evidence on its positive effects on human-centred teaching and learning. Regular mindfulness practice can alter the function and structure of the brain and help learners train their mind to, among other skills, pay attention in a purposeful way and not get distracted by the abundance of external and internal stimuli. It can promote learners' awareness, self-regulation, and other metacognitive skills so they become more resilient and ready to face the challenges of the increasingly-overwhelming digital world.

TI  - Six-year positive effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on mindfulness, coping and well-being in medical and psychology students; Results from a randomized controlled trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Longitudinal research investigating the enduring impact of mindfulness training is scarce. This study investigates the six-year effects of a seven-week mindfulness-based course, by studying intervention effects in the trajectory of dispositional mindfulness and coping skills, and the association between those change trajectories and subjective well-being at six-year follow-up. 288 Norwegian medical and psychology students participated in a randomized controlled trial. 144 received a 15-hour mindfulness course over seven weeks in the second or third semester with booster sessions twice yearly, while the rest continued their normal study curricula. Outcomes were subjective well-being, and dispositional mindfulness and coping assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Ways of Coping Checklist. Analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat sample, using latent growth curve models. At six-year follow-up, students receiving mindfulness training reported increased well-being. Furthermore, they reported greater increases in the trajectory of dispositional mindfulness and problem-focused coping along with greater decreases in the trajectory of avoidance-focused coping. Increases in problem-focused coping predicted increases in well-being. These effects were found despite relatively low levels of adherence to formal mindfulness practice. The findings demonstrate the viability of mindfulness training in the promotion of well-being and adaptive coping, which could contribute to the quality of care given, and to the resilience and persistence of health care professionals.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction in breast cancer: a qualitative analysis.
T2  - Complementary therapies in clinical practice
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - There have been few qualitative investigations evaluating Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in breast cancer populations. The nested qualitative analysis reported here explores the acceptability and the perceived effect of MBSR. As part of a larger randomised controlled evaluative trial, 92 participants with stages 0 to III breast cancer completed a short proforma following week 8 of a MBSR programme conducted at The Haven, an integrated cancer support centre in London, UK in 2005-2006. Following thematic analysis, the most positive experiences from participants (n=92) were reported to be; 1) being calmer, centred, at peace, connected and more confident; 2) the value of mindfulness practice; 3) being more aware; 4) coping with stress, anxiety and panic; 5) accepting things as they are, being less judgemental of myself and others; 6) improved communication and personal relationships and 7) making time and creating space for myself. All participants asked (n=39) said that following MBSR training they had become more mindful. These understandings will be able to help shape the future teaching of MBSR in breast cancer.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship Between Trait Mindfulness and Interpersonal Sensitivity for Chinese College Students: The Mediating Role of Negative Emotions and Moderating Role of Effectiveness/Authenticity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Interpersonal sensitivity is a prominent mental health problem facing college students today. Trait mindfulness is a potential positive factor that may influence interpersonal relationships. However, the precise relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity remains elusive, which limits the optimization and further application of mindfulness-based intervention schemes targeting interpersonal sensitivity. This study aimed to explore (a) whether negative emotions mediate the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity and (b) whether the relationship among trait mindfulness, negative emotions, and interpersonal sensitivity is moderated by effectiveness/authenticity. We hypothesize that (a) negative emotions mediate the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity, and (b) effectiveness/authenticity moderates the indirect association between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity through negative emotions.Methods: One thousand four hundred nineteen Chinese college students (1,023 females, 396 males), aged from 17 to 23 (SD = 0.86, mean = 18.38), participated in this study. Their trait mindfulness, negative emotions, the effectiveness/authenticity, and interpersonal sensitivity were measured using well-validated self-report questionnaires.Results: Correlational analyses indicated that both trait mindfulness and effectiveness/authenticity were significantly and negatively associated with interpersonal sensitivity. Mediation analyses uncovered a partial mediating role of negative emotions in the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity. Moderated mediation analyses showed that in college students with high effectiveness/authenticity, the relationship between trait mindfulness and negative emotions was stronger, whereas the relationship between negative emotions and interpersonal sensitivity was weaker.Conclusion: Negative emotion is a mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity, which in turn is moderated by effectiveness/authenticity. These findings suggest a potential mechanism through which trait mindfulness influences interpersonal sensitivity. Mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to decrease interpersonal sensitivity and offer a basis for predicting individual differences in response to mindfulness-based interventions among individuals.

TI  - Well-being interventions for individuals with diabetes: A systematic review
T2  - DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - In patients with diabetes, psychological well-being constructs (e.g., optimism, positive affect) have been associated with superior medical outcomes, including better glucose control and lower mortality rates. Well-being interventions may be well-suited to individuals with diabetes, as they are simple to deliver, broadly applicable across a range of psychological distress, and may help increase self-efficacy and motivation for diabetes self-care. This systematic review, completed using PRISMA guidelines, examined peer-reviewed studies indexed in PubMed, PsycINFO, and/or Scopus between database inception and October 2017 that investigated the effects of well-being interventions (e.g., positive psychology interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, resilience-based interventions) on psychological and physical health outcomes in individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The search yielded 34 articles (N = 1635 participants), with substantial variability in intervention type, measures used, and outcomes studied; the majority found the intervention to provide benefit. Overall, results indicate that a range of well-being interventions appear to have promise in improving health outcomes in this population, but the literature does not yet provide definitive data about which specific interventions are most effective. The variability in interventions and outcomes points to a need for further rigorous, controlled, and well-powered studies of specific interventions, with well-accepted, clinically relevant outcome measures.

TI  - The Role of Daily Steps in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial of a 6-Month Inter net-Based, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Youth
T2  - INTERACTIVE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Current evidence supports physical activity (PA) as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between objectively measured PA and MDD treatment outcomes using prospective data.Objective: This study is a secondary analysis of data from a 24-week internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for MDD. The purpose of this analysis was twofold: (1) to examine average daily step counts in relation to MDD symptom improvement, and whether pain moderated this relationship; and (2) to examine whether changes in step activity (ie, step trajectories) during treatment were associated with baseline symptoms and symptom improvement.Methods: Patients from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health were part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy for young adults (aged 18-30 years old) with MDD. Data from 20 participants who had completed the intervention were analyzed. PA, in the form of objectively measured steps, was measured using the Fitbit-HR Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc), and self-reported depression severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Linear regression analysis was used to test PA's relationship with depression improvement and the moderating effect of pain severity and pain interference. Growth curve and multivariable regression models were used to test longitudinal associations.Results: Participants walked an average of 8269 steps per day, and each additional +1000-step difference between participants was significantly associated with a 2.66-point greater improvement (reduction) in BDI-II, controlling for anxiety, pain interference, and adherence to Fitbit monitoring (P=.02). Pain severity appeared to moderate (reduce) the positive effect of average daily steps on BDI-II improvement (P=.03). Higher baseline depression and anxiety symptoms predicted less positive step trajectories throughout treatment (Ps <=.001), and more positive step trajectories early in the trial predicted greater MDD improvement at the end of the trial (Ps<.04). However, step trajectories across the full duration of the trial did not significantly predict MDD improvement (Ps=.40).Conclusions: This study used objective measurements to demonstrate positive associations between PA and depression improvement in the context of cognitive behavioral treatment. Pain appeared to moderate this relationship, and baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted PA trajectories. The findings inform future interventions for major depression. Future research with larger samples should consider additional moderators of PA-related treatment success and the extent to which outcomes are related to PA change in multimodal interventions.

TI  - The neural mediators of kindness-based meditation: a theoretical model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although kindness-based contemplative practices are increasingly employed by clinicians and cognitive researchers to enhance prosocial emotions, social cognitive skills, and wellbeing, and as a tool to understand the basic workings of the social mind, we lack a coherent theoretical model with which to test the mechanisms by which kindness-based meditation may alter the brain and body. Here, we link contemplative accounts of compassion and loving-kindness practices with research from social cognitive neuroscience and social psychology to generate predictions about how diverse practices may alter brain structure and function and related aspects of social cognition. Contingent on the nuances of the practice, kindness-based meditation may enhance the neural systems related to faster and more basic perceptual or motor simulation processes, simulation of another's affective body state, slower and higher-level perspective-taking, modulatory processes such as emotion regulation and self/other discrimination, and combinations thereof.This theoretical model will be discussed alongside best practices for testing such a model and potential implications and applications of future work.

TI  - Understanding Engagement in and Affective Experiences During Physical Activity: The Role of Meditation Interventions
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Meditation interventions promote an array of well-being outcomes. However, the way in which these interventions promote beneficial outcomes is less clear. Here, we expanded on prior work by examining the influence of mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation on a key health behavior: physical activity. Methods To test our hypotheses, we drew upon two randomized intervention studies. In the first study, 171 adults (73.0% female) received 6 weeks of training in either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation, or were assigned to a control condition. In the second study, 124 adults (60.0% female) were assigned to a 6-week mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation group. Results Study 1 demonstrated that individuals who received mindfulness training reported sustained levels of physical activity across the intervention period (Pre: mean [standard deviation], or M [SD] = 4.09 [2.07]; Post: M [SD] = 3.68 [2.00]; p = .054), whereas those in the control (Pre: M [SD] = 3.98 [2.25]; Post: M [SD] = 3.01 [2.07]; p < .001) and loving-kindness (Pre: M [SD] = 4.11 [2.26]; Post: M [SD] = 3.45 [1.96]; p < .001) conditions reported lower levels. Study 2 demonstrated those who received mindfulness training experienced increases in positive emotions during physical activity from preintervention to postintervention (Pre: M [SD] = 6.06 [2.51]; Post: M [SD] = 6.54 [2.43]; p = .001), whereas those trained in loving-kindness meditation experienced decreases in positive emotions during physical activity (Pre: M [SD] = 6.45 [2.35]; Post: M [SD] = 6.09 [2.46]; p = .040). Conclusions These results suggest mindfulness training (but not loving-kindness training) promotes sustained physical activity, and one plausible reason why this occurs is enhanced positive emotion during physical activity.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An experiment involving 115 undergraduate students (74.8% females; mean age=20.5 years, SD=4.3) was conducted to explore effects of meditation on social connectedness, nature connectedness, and affect. Participants listened to one of three brief guided meditation Mp3 recordings via the internet, which involved mindfulness meditation (MM), loving-kindness meditation (LKM), or progressive muscle relaxation (active control group). Participants in the MM and LKM groups reported greater social and nature connectedness at post-test than those in the control group. There were no significant differences in connectedness between the MM and LKM groups, suggesting they are both effective for enhancing connectedness. There were no significant changes in negative or positive affect at post-test due to the interventions. Recommendations for future research are provided.

TI  - Gaining headspace: A classroom-based mindfulness intervention to promote attention for primary students
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The authors investigated whether a functional relation exists between the mindfulness-based intervention Headspace and student attentive behavior, and the perceptions of Headspace from instructors who used the intervention. The study was conducted in three classrooms with elementary-age students. The intervention was delivered via the Headspace application. Data were collected using systematic direct observation. The research design was a multiple baseline design. Each classroom was the unit of analysis. Data were analyzed using visual analysis and by calculating a between-case standardized mean difference. Results showed a nonsignificant, small effect size (g = 0.53, (95% CI [-0.15, 1.22]). Overall, results from the visual analysis suggest there was not a functional relation between Headspace and attentive behavior. The perceptions of Headspace by instructors were not positive. The results differ from previous results in the literature and are interpreted considering limitations related to the planning/design of the study as well as its execution.Headspace, a self-administered mindfulness program, implemented for 6 min daily with minimal interventionist input using Headspace kids sessions, may not improve students' attentive behavior Instructors' perceptions of Headspace as an intervention were largely unfavorable; the majority of instructors with pre-post data slightly agreed the intervention was acceptable but disagreed or strongly disagreed about it being effective. Although results from the current study did not support Headspace as an effective Tier 1 intervention, it is conceptually one that fits well within that tier of support. However, results suggested that more involvement by instructional staff may be important to students benefitting from the intervention. If future research were to provide more support for Headspace as an effective intervention for attentive behavior, schools that choose to implement Headspace as a mindfulness-based intervention may benefit from training teachers to take a more active role in the implementation of the intervention.

TI  - Loving-Kindness in the Treatment of Traumatized Refugees and Minority Groups: A Typology of Mindfulness and the Nodal Network Model of Affect and Affect Regulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses how loving-kindness can be used to treat traumatized refugees and minority groups, focusing on examples from our treatment, culturally adapted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CA-CBT). To show how we integrate loving-kindness with other mindfulness interventions and why loving-kindness should be an effective therapeutic technique, we present a typology of mindfulness states and the Nodal Network Model (NNM) of Affect and Affect Regulation. We argue that mindfulness techniques such as loving-kindness are therapeutic for refugees and minority populations because of their potential for increasing emotional flexibility, decreasing rumination, serving as emotional regulation techniques, and forming part of a new adaptive processing mode centered on psychological flexibility. We present a case to illustrate the clinical use of loving-kindness within the context of CA-CBT.

TI  - The Slow Down Program: A mixed methods pilot study of a mindfulness-based stress management and nutrition education program for mothers
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Stress levels have been associated with a broad range of adverse health outcomes, particularly for mothers and subsequently, their children. Mindfulness-based stress management is a tool that has effectively been utilized in several disciplines and has potential applications to eating behaviors. This paper describes the effects of an exploratory mindfulness-based stress management and nutrition education program, the Slow Down Program, on mothers' perceived stress, eating behavior, and self-efficacy.Design & setting: This study used a mixed methods quasi-experimental design. Nineteen mothers with young children (five or younger) participated in the study. The SDP consisted of four consecutive weekly 1.5 h sessions focused on experiential learning and facilitated discussion.Main outcome measures: Quantitative data were collected pre-and post-intervention and included: the Perceived Stress Scale; Mindfulness Self-Efficacy Scale; and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised-18. Qualitative data included a focus group post-intervention and an individual interview 4-6 weeks post-intervention.Results: The SDP showed significant improvements in participants' perceived stress (p = .04), uncontrolled eating (p < 0.01), cognitive restraint (p < 0.01), and mindfulness self-efficacy (p < 0.01). Qualitatively, participants also reported changes in self-efficacy and eating behaviors-specifically improvements in mindful eating, and sensory and satiety awareness.Conclusions: The results of this pilot study demonstrate that nutrition programs incorporated with mindfulness strategies may offer positive, short-term impacts on stress reduction and eating behaviors. Additional studies are warranted across a variety of populations with more rigorous study designs to assess long-term effects.

TI  - Towards recovery-oriented psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder: Quality of life outcomes, stage-sensitive treatments, and mindfulness mechanisms
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Current adjunctive psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder (BD) aim to impact illness course via information sharing/skill development. This focus on clinical outcomes contrasts with the emergent recovery paradigm, which prioritises adaptation to serious mental illness and movement towards personally meaningful goals. The aim of this review is to encourage innovation in the psychological management of BD by considering three recovery-oriented trends in the literature. First, the importance of quality of life as a target of recovery-oriented clinical work is considered. Second, the recent staging approach to BD is described, and we outline implications for psychosocial interventions tailored to stage. Finally, we review evidence suggesting that mindfulness-based psycho social interventions have potential across early, middle and late stages of BD. It is concluded that the humanistic emphasis of the recovery paradigm provides a timely stimulus for development of a next generation of psycho social treatments for people with BD.

TI  - Improving Health of People With Multiple Sclerosis From a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study in Parallel Groups: Preliminary Results on the Efficacy of a Mindfulness Intervention and Intention Implementation Associated With a Physical Activity Program
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of psychological Interventions - Mindfulness or Implementation Intention - associated with a Physical Activity program, delivered via internet, in reducing Multiple Sclerosis symptoms.Method: Thirty-five adults were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: a Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (N = 12), Implementation Intention group (N = 11), and a Control Group (N = 12). All the groups received the same Physical Activity program. The Mindfulness condition group received daily training in the form of pre-recorded sessions while the Implementation group elaborated their specific plans once a week. Mobility, fatigue, and the impact of the disease on the patient's life were measured. Two measurement times are carried out in pre-post intervention, at baseline and after eight weeks.Results: Overall, after 8 weeks intervention, results show that there was a significant increase in Walking distance in the three groups. In addition, the within-group analysis showed a statistically significant improvement between pre and post intervention on the physical component of the Disease Impact scale in the Implementation Intention group (p = 0.023) with large effect size, in the Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (p = 0.008) with a medium effect size and in the control group (p = 0.028) with small effect size. In the Implementation Intention group, all physical, psychosocial and cognitive Fatigue Impact subscales scores decreased significantly (p = 0.022, p = 0.023, and p = 0.012, respectively) and the physical component was statistically and negatively correlated (r = -0.745; p = 0.008) when Implementation Intention group practice a mild to moderate physical activity. In the Mindfulness-Based Intervention group, the physical component (MFIS) showed a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.028) but no correlation with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA); the control group outcomes did not reveal any significant change.Conclusion: The results of this study are very encouraging and show the feasibility of Mindfulness interventions associated with physical activity to improve the health of people with MS. Further study should assess Mindfulness interventions tailored to MS condition and using both hedonic and eudemonic measures of happiness.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer survivors (MBSR(BC)): evaluating mediators of psychological and physical outcomes in a large randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - MBSR(BC) is known to have a positive impact on psychological and physical symptoms among breast cancer survivors (BCS). The cognitive mechanisms of "how" MBSR(BC) works was addressed in a recent study that found that there was strong consistent evidence that reduced emotional reactivity is a mediator and moderate consistent evidence that mindfulness, rumination, and worry were mediators. The purpose of this study, as part of a larger R01 trial, was to test whether positive effects achieved from the MBSR(BC) program were mediated through changes in increased mindfulness, decreased fear of breast cancer recurrence, and perceived stress. Female BCS > 21 years diagnosed with Stage 0-III breast cancer were randomly assigned to a 6-week MBSR(BC) or a Usual Care (UC)regimen. Potential mediators of 6- and 12-week outcomes were identified by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), followed by formal mediational analyses of main effects of MBSR(BC) on 6- and 12-week outcomes, including percentage of total effects explained. Among 322 BCS (167 MBSR(BC) and 155 UC), fear of recurrence and perceived stress, but not mindfulness, mediated reductions in anxiety and fatigue at weeks 6 and 12, partially supporting our hypothesis of cognitive mechanisms of MBSR(BC).

TI  - Women's Experiences with a Mindful Eating Program for Binge and Emotional Eating: A Qualitative Investigation into the Process of Change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives:Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to reduce engagement in disordered eating behaviors, although how these interventions engender change remains unclear. The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to describe the experiences and perceived attitudinal and behavioral changes of women participating in a mindful eating program. Design:Focus group discussions were held with women participating in a community-based mindful eating program for binge and emotional eating. A semistructured interview guide was used to explore participants' conceptualizations of mindfulness-based attitudinal and behavior change, as related to food, eating, and body image. The focus group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify salient concepts. Settings/Location:Focus group discussions were held at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (United States). Participants:A sample of nine women who were enrolled in the mindful eating program at UMMS for problems with self-reported binge and/or emotional eating participated in this study. Results:Four themes were constructed that described a process of mindfulness-based behavior change, including (1) Learning Through Self-Awareness, (2) Self-Empowerment, (3) Mindful Choice-Making, and (4) Resilient Self-Care. An overarching description of the participants' perceived attitudinal and behavior changes was developed: "unforced freedom of choice, emerging from embodied awareness." Conclusions:These findings suggest that MBIs reduce may disordered eating behaviors through empowering women to make positive choices about food, eating, and coping, without focusing on weight control. Future research is needed to examine whether these findings replicate in larger and more diverse samples, and how they can be used to optimize and implement eating-specific MBIs in community-based settings.

Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 53, 233238. Multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) is a medically unexplained and socially disabling disorder characterized by negative health effects attributed to exposure to common airborne chemicals. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment. The objectives of the study were to assess the feasibility of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program (MBCT) for adults with MCS and to evaluate possible effects on psychological distress and illness perception. The study design was a randomized clinical trial. The MBCT programme comprised 8 weekly sessions of 2(1/2) hours. Forty-two adults were screened for eligibility and 37 were included. Mean age of the participants was 51.6 years, 35 (94.6%) were female and 21 (56.8%) were unemployed. Measures of psychological distress and illness perceptions were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and at 3 months follow-up. No significant differences in effect measures were found between the groups. However, those who completed the MBCT program generally reported benefiting in terms of improved coping strategies and sleep quality. The positive verbal feedback from the participants in the MBCT group suggests that a larger randomized clinical trial on the effect of MBCT for MCS could be considered.

TI  - Cognitive Fusion Mediates the Relationship between Dispositional Mindfulness and Negative Affects: A Study in a Sample of Spanish Children and Adolescent School Students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have experienced a remarkable development of studies among childhood and adolescent interventions. For this reason, dispositional mindfulness (DM) measures for children and adolescents have been developed to determine the effectiveness of MBI at this age stage. However, little is known about how key elements of DM (for example, cognitive de/fusion or experiential avoidance that both confirm psychological inflexibility) are involved in the mechanisms of the children and adolescents' mental health outcomes. This research examined the mediating effect of cognitive fusion between DM and anxiety and other negative emotional states in a sample of 318 Spanish primary-school students (aged between 8 and 16 years, M = 11.24, SD = 2.19, 50.8% males). Participants completed the AFQ-Y (Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for youth), which is a measure of psychological inflexibility that encompasses cognitive defusion and experiential avoidance; CAMM (DM for children and adolescents), PANAS-N (positive and negative affect measure for children, Spanish version of PANASC), and STAIC (an anxiety measure for children). The study accomplished ethical standards. As MBI relevant literature has suggested, cognitive defusion was a significant mediator between DM and symptoms of both negative emotions and anxiety in children and adolescents. However, experiential avoidance did not show any significant mediating relationship. Probably, an improvement of the assessment of experiential avoidance is needed. MBI programs for children and adolescents may include more activities for reducing effects of the cognitive defusion on their emotional distress.

TI  - Associations of mindfulness with depressive symptoms and well-being in older adults: the moderating role of neuroticism
T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate whether observed interactions of mindfulness with the personality trait neuroticism extend to older adults and to aspects of psychological functioning other than depressive symptoms, and whether effects of mindfulness training in this population depend on levels of neuroticism. Method: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for community-dwelling older adults. We investigated whether neuroticism moderates associations of dispositional mindfulness with various aspects of psychological and physical functioning at baseline, as well as effects of MBSR on these outcomes. Results: Significant two-way interactions showed that greater mindfulness was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and less negative affect at baseline in individuals with average or higher levels of neuroticism. In contrast, mindfulness was associated with greater positive affect and vitality and fewer physical symptoms regardless of the level of neuroticism. There were no effects of MBSR on these outcomes at any level of neuroticism. Conclusion: Mindfulness may be more protective against psychological ill-being in older adults with higher levels of neuroticism, but conducive to positive psychological and physical well-being regardless of this personality trait. The potential moderating role of neuroticism should be further evaluated in studies of mindfulness-based interventions in older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of aromatherapy with lavender and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) on female sexual function.DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.SETTING: Health centers in Roudan city, Iran.PARTICIPANTS: Sixty married women, ages 18 to 45 years, were recruited using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Participants were selected from health centers in 2022 via convenience sampling.INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Upon their completion of a demographic checklist and the FSFI as a pretest, participants were divided into three groups, including lavender aromatherapy (n= 20), MBCT-S (n= 20), and control (n= 20) through random selection with permutation blocks. All groups completed FSFI as a posttest. Data were analyzed by SPSS 26 using chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney statistical tests.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference among the three groups before the intervention (p= .652), but there was a significant difference among them after the intervention (p= .001). There was a significantly positive difference between the intervention groups and the control group (p< .001). A significant relationship was observed among the three groups in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, lubrication, and arousal. The mean scores of the posttest in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, and lubrication were positively higher in the MBCT-S group than in the aromatherapy group, and both intervention groups showed the same effect for sexual arousal. Aromatherapy and counseling had no significant effect on improving sexual orgasm.CONCLUSION: MBCT-S can be used to improve many aspects of female sexual function, except for orgasm disorders; aromatherapy may improve sexual arousal.

TI  - Systematic Review of Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Weight Management Among Pre- and Post-bariatric Surgery Patients.
T2  - Advances in mind-body medicine
M3  - Systematic Review
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Context: Bariatric surgery has been an effective treatment for severe obesity. However, it can be challenging for bariatric-surgery patients to reach and maintain long-term weight loss. Behavioral interventions may be beneficial in reducing weight and improving the psychological outcomes of bariatric patients.Objective: The review intended to evaluate the benefits of mindfulness training for weight management among pre- and postoperative, bariatric-surgery patients and to help determine the design of the most effective mindfulness program for them.Design: The research team performed a systematic narrative review by searching the Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases. The search terms included mindfulness-based therapy, stress reduction, relaxation therapy, meditation, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Eligible studies included those using interventions that examined the impact of mindfulness on weight loss for bariatric-surgery patients. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, the research team conducted a narrative synthesis rather than a meta-analysis.Setting: The review took place in the Community Health Sciences Department at the College of Applied Medical Sciences of King Saud University in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes included indicators of body-weight change, such as kilograms, pounds, or BMIs. Secondary outcomes included changes: (1) in eating behavior, such as in binge eating, grazing behavior, craving behavior, and emotional eating, (2) in caloric intake, (3) in mental health, including a reduction in anxiety or depression, (4) in quality of life, (5) mindfulness acceptability and practice, (6) in physical activity, and (7) in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).Results: The research team included eight studies in the review. One study aimed to explore the impact of mindfulness on pre-operative patients, and the remaining seven studies measured the impact among postoperative individuals. Most studies suggested that mindfulness-based interventions can have a positive impact on weight outcomes and eating behaviors. The team also found promising effects for mental health outcomes, including anxiety and depression. It's important to note that the included studies reported no strategies that examined treatment fidelity and the monitoring of an intervention's delivery.Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can be useful in tackling eating disorders and in promoting weight loss among bariatric individuals. Further studies are warranted in this area to make explicit recommendations that inform pre- and post-bariatric guidelines. The field needs further well-developed studies to understand the impact of mindfulness on weight loss in the long term.

TI  - Group Metacognitive Therapy vs. Mindfulness Meditation Therapy in a Transdiagnostic Patient Sample: A Randomised Feasibility Trial
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Two transdiagnostic therapies for treating psychological disorder are Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). These two approaches have yet to be compared and therefore the current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a study of group MCT and MBSR in treating anxiety and depression. A feasibility trial with 40 participants (aged 19-56) was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either eight weeks of group MCT or MBSR. The primary outcome was feasibility which included recruitment rates, retention and treatment acceptability. The primary symptom outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score, which provided an overall measure of distress. Both treatments were found to be acceptable with low attrition and similar ratings of acceptability. Changes in outcomes were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle using mixed effect models. Preliminary analyses revealed that MCT was more effective in treating anxiety and depression in comparison to MBSR, and in reducing both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs. Reliable improvement rates favoured MCT at post-treatment and 6-month follow up. Both treatments appeared to be feasible and acceptable in treating transdiagnostic samples; however, a larger, definitive trial is required. The limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder: protocol of a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a very disabling condition with a chronic course, if left untreated. Though cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) with or without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is the method of choice, up to one third of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not respond to treatment in terms of at least 35% improvement of symptoms. Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an 8-week group program that could help OCD patients with no or only partial response to CBT to reduce OC symptoms and develop a helpful attitude towards obsessions and compulsive urges.Methods/design: This study is a prospective, bicentric, assessor-blinded, randomized, actively-controlled clinical trial. 128 patients with primary diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-IV and no or only partial response to CBT will be recruited from in- and outpatient services as well as online forums and the media. Patients will be randomized to either an MBCT intervention group or to a psycho-educative coaching group (OCD-EP) as an active control condition. All participants will undergo eight weekly sessions with a length of 120 minutes each of a structured group program. We hypothesize that MBCT will be superior to OCD-EP in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) following the intervention and at 6- and 12-months-follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include depressive symptoms, quality of life, metacognitive beliefs, self-compassion, mindful awareness and approach-avoidance tendencies as measured by an approach avoidance task.Discussion: The results of this study will elucidate the benefits of MBCT for OCD patients who did not sufficiently benefit from CBT. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled study assessing the effects of MBCT on symptom severity and associated parameters in OCD.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Intervention Effect on the Psychophysiological Marker of Self-Regulation in Women With Endometriosis-Related Chronic Pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometriosis is a gynecological disease that involves a broad biopsychosocial compromise with the potential to create a negative vicious cycle. Despite the complexity of factors influencing women's improvement, most interventions investigated target just the peripheral nociceptive sources of endometriosis-related pain. An alternative is intervening in self-regulation, which can potentially influence multiple domains of the illness experience. The present study examines the effect of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention (bMBI) on attention and autonomic nervous system regulation in women with endometriosis-related pain. Also, explore the interaction between these self-regulation domains and the affective pain dimension. An exploratory analysis of the secondary outcomes of a pilot randomized controlled trial was performed. The vagally-mediated Heart Rate Variability (vmHRV) at rest, cognitive stress, and recovery was employed to measure autonomic regulation. The Flanker and Stroop tasks were used to estimate the attention domains. Results showed that bMBI (n = 26) significantly improved Flanker accuracy and Flanker and Stroop reaction time compared to the control group (n = 28). bMBI significantly increased vmHRV at rest and recovery after cognitive stress. Attention mediated the bMBI effect on affective pain improvement. Results suggest that bMBI improves self-regulation domains with the potential to develop a broad biopsychosocial benefit in the endometriosis context.Perspective: This article demonstrates the positive impact of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention on attention and parasympathetic regulation in women suffering from endometriosisrelated pain. This mindfulness-induced self-regulation improvement can benefit affective pain and potentially multiple psychophysiological processes relevant to endometriosis.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc

TI  - Mindful Mates: A Pilot Study of the Relational Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Participants and Their Partners
T2  - FAMILY PROCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Very little is currently known about how increases in dispositional mindfulness through mindfulness training affect the quality of participants' romantic relationships, and no previous studies have examined how increases in specific facets of mindfulness differentially contribute to relationship health. Additionally, even less is known about how an individual's development of mindfulness skills affects the relationship satisfaction of his or her romantic partner. Thus, the purpose of this pilot study was to examine associations between changes in facets of mindfulness and relationship satisfaction among participants enrolled in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course and their nonenrolled romantic partners. Twenty MBSR participants and their nonenrolled partners (n = 40) completed measures of mindfulness and relationship satisfaction pre- and post-enrolled partners' completion of an MBSR course. Results indicated that enrolled participants significantly improved on all facets of mindfulness and relationship satisfaction, while nonenrolled partners did not significantly increase on any facet of mindfulness or relationship satisfaction. Moreover, enrolled participants' increases in Acting with Awareness were positively associated with increases in their own and their nonenrolled partners' relationship satisfaction, whereas increases in enrolled participants' Nonreactivity were positively associated with increases in their nonenrolled partners' (but not their own) relationship satisfaction. These results suggest that increasing levels of mindfulness (particularly specific aspects of mindfulness) may have positive effects on couples' relationship satisfaction and highlight mindfulness training as a promising tool for education and intervention efforts aimed at promoting relational health.

TI  - The Effects of a Modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program for Nurses: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - WORKPLACE HEALTH & SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of a modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on the levels of stress, affect, and resilience among nurses in general hospitals in mainland China. In addition, the study attempted to determine the impact of the program on job satisfaction. A total of 110 nurses were randomly assigned to the intervention versus control groups. The intervention group participated in a modified 8-week MBSR program. All participants were evaluated with questionnaires at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 3 months later. The intervention group showed decreases in stress and negative affect and increases in positive affect and resilience after the intervention. No improvement in job satisfaction was observed, but the trends of the data were in the hypothesized direction that job satisfaction would improve. The modified MBSR program is an effective approach for nurses to decrease stress and negative affect and improve positive affect and resilience. In addition, the program has the potential to improve job satisfaction.

TI  - Does Meditation Training Influence Social Approach and Avoidance Goals? Evidence from a Randomized Intervention Study of Midlife Adults
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Social approach and avoidance goals-which refer to individual differences in the desire to pursue rewards versus avoid negative experiences in social relationships-have numerous implications for the health and quality of social relationships. Although endorsement of these goals largely arises from people's pre-dispositions towards approach and avoidance, in this research, we proposed that meditation training has the potential to beneficially influence the extent to which people adopt approach and avoidance goals. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals who were randomly assigned to receive training in mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation would report differences in social approach and avoidance goals, as compared with those in a wait-list control condition, and that these effects would be mediated by differences in positive and negative emotions. Methods To examine these hypotheses, we drew upon a community-based, randomized intervention study of 138 midlife adults, who were assigned to receive mindfulness training, loving-kindness training, or no training in meditation. Results As compared with the control condition, results demonstrated that loving-kindness training was directly associated with lower social avoidance goals, and indirectly associated with greater social approach goals, via enhanced positive emotion. Conclusions These results suggest loving-kindness meditation is a means by which people can beneficially influence their approach and avoidance tendencies, which likely plays an important role in enhancing their social relationships.

TI  - Positive Effects of Two Interventions to Reduce Stress in Students of Different Courses of Study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - : Background: Students report high levels of stress. Aim: Investigation of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral and meditation interventions to reduce stress in students of psychology and dentistry. Method: In longitudinal control group comparisons, 262 students were divided into five groups: cognitive-behavioral training (IGcogPsy: n = 59 psychology; IGcogDent: n = 41 dentistry), mindfulness-based meditation (IGmedPsy: n = 63 psychology), measurement controls (CGPsy: n = 57 psychology; CGDent: n = 42 dentistry). 126 psychology students (IGcogPsy: n = 43; IGmedPsy: n = 47; CGPsy: n = 36) took follow-up tests 6 months after training. Results: ANCOVAs with repeated measurement factor (interactions group/time t1 to t2; co-variates: terms studied, gender, the stress in addition to studies) and contrasts over pairwise differences (alpha-error accumulation correction applied) showed stronger improvements for all IGs compared to CGs in coping strategies, self-efficacy, and learning strategies. IGcogPsy also improved more in test anxiety, and IGcogDent in test anxiety, trait and state anxiety. IGcogPsy and IGmedPsy reduced stress symptoms. At follow-up (simultaneous ANCOVAs t1, t2, t3; contrasts), more favorable development in test anxiety and some learning strategies resulted in both IGcogPsy and IGmedPsy compared to CGPsy. Limitations: Controls received feedback on concentration development but no alternative intervention. Confounding by self-selection cannot be ruled out. Conclusion: Cognitive-behavioral intervention had comprehensive impacts on all areas under investigation for both psychology and dental students; meditation was effective primarily in areas not directly related to action. Both interventions evoked some long-term effects.

TI  - The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Association Between Autonomic Interoceptive Signals and Emotion Regulation Selection
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The ability to select the most adaptive regulatory strategy as a function of the emotional context plays a pivotal role in psychological health. Recently, we showed that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can improve the sensitivity of regulatory strategy selection to emotional intensity. However, the mechanisms underlying this improvement are unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that MBIs support adaptive regulatory selection by increasing sensitivity to interoceptive signals associated with the emotional stimuli.Methods: Participants (n = 84, mean [standard deviation {SD}] age = 30.9 [8.3] years; 54% women) were randomized to either a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program or a wait-list control condition. Before and after the MBSR program, physiological measures for autonomic nervous system activity were obtained, and participants performed a task examining emotion regulation selections (reappraisal versus distraction) when confronted with low or high negative intensity images. They also completed a battery of mindfulness, interoception, and well-being self-report measures. A cross-classified model was used for the main analyses.Results: The participants assigned to the MBSR were overall more likely to choose reappraisal than distraction (b = 0.26, posterior SD = 0.13, 95confidence interval = 0.02-0.52) after the program. Interoceptive signals in response to negative images were associated with subsequent regulatory selections (b = 0.02, posterior SD = 0.01, 95% confidence interval = 0.01-0.03) in the MBSR group. Specifically, lower cardiac reactivity was associated with the choice to reappraise, whereas higher cardiac reactivity was related to the choice to distract. Greater differences in cardiac reactivity between states that prompt reappraisal and states that prompt distraction were associated with higher well-being (Satisfaction With Life Scale, Pearson r (29) = 0.527, p =.003).Conclusions: Mindfulness seems to increase the sensitivity of regulatory selections to interoceptive signals, and this is associated with subjective well-being. This may be a central pathway through which MBIs exert their positive effects on mental health and resilience.

TI  - Students experiences of an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention at a college of opportunity: a qualitative investigation of the mindfulness-based college program
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based programs have the potential to improve the well-being of undergraduate students by reducing anxiety, depression, and isolation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore lived experiences of undergraduates in a mindfulness-based program at a "college of opportunity " that has high proportions of first-generation college students. Specifically, we sought to: (1) explore the application of mindfulness practices in students' daily lives; (2) explore how participants believe mindfulness training affected their health and well-being; (3) learn participants' recommendations and suggested changes for mindfulness-based interventions in future iterations. Methods: Students were recruited from XXX and consented to participate in semi-structured digitally conducting interviews after the completion of the 8-week intervention in the Fall/Spring 2020 academic year. Data were analyzed using Applied Thematic Analysis and a codebook was constructed using a consensus-driven process using both a priori and emergent coding. All transcripts were double-coded, and concordance was achieved for all interviews. Results: Qualitative results indicated that the most applied practices were those that could be easily incorporated into a daily routine. Furthermore, students reported an increased ability to cope with a variety of stressors, decreased reactivity, and enhanced resilience specifically concerning mental health challenges. Additionally, engaging in mindfulness training improved students' ability to navigate social distancing measures, other COVID-19-specific stress, and enhanced motivation for self-care practices to sustain well-being. Concerning preferred intervention delivery modality, participants stated that due to multiple, growing responsibilities (e.g., pressures of commuting to class) they preferred in-person delivery, shorter sessions over a longer period, with classes in the morning or early afternoon. Conclusions: Findings provide pragmatic and psychosocial insights into students' application of mindfulness training across personal, professional, and academic domains enhancing their well-being. This work builds on qualitative work concerning students' perceptions and applications of mindfulness while offering insights into the future of mindfulness programs among undergraduates.

TI  - LOVING-KINDNESS MEDITATION'S EFFECTS ON NITRIC OXIDE AND PERCEIVED WELL-BEING: A PILOT STUDY IN EXPERIENCED AND INEXPERIENCED MEDITATORS
T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Meditation is associated with lower blood pressure, but little is known about how loving-kindness meditation affects nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, a key mediator of cardiovascular physiology associated with vasodilation.Methods: We studied seven inexperienced and five experienced healthy meditators at one study visit, after they refrained from eating nitrate-rich foods for at least 12 h. Participants completed questionnaires on demographics and meditation practices. We measured nitrite and nitrate and self-reported stress at baseline, after a neutral reading period (prior to meditation), immediately after, and 10 min following a standardized 20-min loving-kindness meditation.Results: The 12 subjects had a mean age of 51 years, and two were male. Stress was significantly lower at baseline in the experienced group (15 vs. 49 on 100 point scale, P < .05) as was heart rate (HR) [68.1 +/- 0.5 beats per minute (bpm) vs. 73.4 +/- 0.7 bpm, P < .05]. Stress levels fell significantly with meditation (52 vs. 11, P < .05), while relaxation increased (55 vs. 89, P < .05) in the inexperienced group. Plasma nitrite levels were not significantly higher, but nitrate levels were more than twice as high (P < .05) for experienced vs. inexperienced meditators before and after loving-kindness meditation.Conclusion: Loving-kindness meditation is associated with stress reduction in inexperienced meditators. Experienced meditators had higher nitrate levels, trended toward having higher nitrite levels, and had significantly lower stress levels than inexperienced meditators. Nitric oxide metabolism may be involved in the cardiovascular effects of persistent meditation practice. Larger longitudinal studies would be fruitful to better understand the mechanisms involved.

TI  - Self-views in social anxiety disorder: The impact of CBT versus MBSR
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impact of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT) versus Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus Waitlist (WL) on self-views in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). One hundred eight unmedicated patients with SAD were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CBGT, MBSR, or WL, and completed a self-referential encoding task (SRET) that assessed self-endorsement of positive and negative self-views pre- and post-treatment. At baseline, 40 healthy controls (HCs) also completed the SRET. At baseline, patients with SAD endorsed greater negative and lesser positive self-views than HCs. Compared to baseline, patients in both CBGT and MBSR decreased negative self-views and increased positive self-views. Improvement in self-views, specifically increases in positive (but not decreases in negative) self-views, predicted CBGT-and MBSR-related decreases in social anxiety symptoms. Enhancement of positive self-views may be a shared therapeutic process for both CBGT and MBSR for SAD. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mindfulness practice: A promising approach to reducing the effects of clinician implicit bias on patients
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Like the population at large, health care providers hold implicit racial and ethnic biases that may contribute to health care disparities. Little progress has been made in identifying and implementing effective strategies to address these normal but potentially harmful unconscious cognitive processes. We propose that meditation training designed to increase healthcare providers' mindfulness skills is a promising and potentially sustainable way to address this problem. Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness practice can reduce the provider contribution to healthcare disparities through several mechanisms including: reducing the likelihood that implicit biases will be activated in the mind, increasing providers' awareness of and ability to control responses to implicit biases once activated, increasing self-compassion and compassion toward patients, and reducing internal sources of cognitive load (e.g., stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue). Mindfulness training may also have advantages over current approaches to addressing implicit bias because it focuses on the development of skills through practice, promotes a nonjudgmental approach, can circumvent resistance some providers feel when directly confronted with evidence of racism, and constitutes a holistic approach to promoting providers' well-being. We close with suggestions for how a mindfulness approach can be practically implemented and identify potential challenges and research gaps to be addressed. (C) Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Meditation affects word recognition of meditation novices
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - This work represents one of the first attempts to examine the effects of meditation on the processing of written single words. In the present longitudinal study, participants conducted a lexical decision task and rated the affective valence of nouns before and after a 7-week class in mindfulness meditation, loving-kindness meditation, or a control intervention. Both meditation groups rated the emotional valence of nouns more neutral after the interventions, suggesting a general down-regulation of emotions. In the loving-kindness group, positive words were rated more positively after the intervention, suggesting a specific intensification of positive feelings. After both meditation interventions, response times in the lexical decision task accelerated significantly, with the largest facilitation occurring in the loving-kindness group. We assume that meditation might have led to increased attention, better visual discrimination, a broadened attentional focus, and reduced mind-wandering, which in turn enabled accelerated word recognition. These results extend findings from a previous study with expert Zen meditators, in which we found that one session of advanced meditation can affect word recognition in a very similar way.

AB  - We explore the role of meditative practice in cultivating experiences of compassion, empathy, and altruism and address an apparent paradox: Mediatation often is associated with solitary retreat, If not preoccupation with one's own concerns. How, then, does such a practice promote compassion for others? We propose a two-stage model. The first stage involves disengagement from usual preoccupation with self-rein forcing, self-defeating, or self-indulgent behaviors and reactions; the second involves a focused engagement with a universal human capacity for altruistic experience, love, and compassion. Reference is made to the limited research literature and to clinical applications of loving kindness (metta) meditation in cultivating these processes.

TI  - Compassion cultivation training promotes medical student wellness and enhanced clinical care
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Compassionate health care is associated with positive patient outcomes. Educational interventions for medical students that develop compassion may also increase wellness, decrease burnout, and improve provider-patient relationships. Research on compassion training in medical education is needed to determine how students learn and apply these skills. The authors evaluated an elective course for medical students modeled after the Compassion Cultivation Training course developed by the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education. The elective goals were to strengthen student compassion, kindness, and wellness through compassion training and mindfulness meditation training modeled by a faculty instructor. The research objectives were to understand students' applications and perceptions of this training.Methods: Over three years, 45 students participated in the elective at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. The course administered a pre/post Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills that measured observing, describing, acting with awareness, and accepting without judgment. Qualitative analyses of self-reported experiences were used to assess students' perceptions of compassion training and their application of skills learned through the elective.Results: The mindfulness inventory showed significant improvements in observing (t = 3.62, p = 0.005) and accepting without judgment skills (t = 2.87, p = 0.017) for some elective cohorts. Qualitative data indicated that students across all cohorts found the elective rewarding, and they used mindfulness, meditation, and compassion skills broadly outside the course. Students described how the training helped them address major stressors associated with personal, academic, and clinical responsibilities. Students also reported that the skills strengthened interpersonal interactions, including with patients.Conclusions: These outcomes illuminate students' attitudes toward compassion training and suggest that among receptive students, a brief, student-focused intervention can be enthusiastically received and positively influence students' compassion toward oneself and others. To underscore the importance of interpersonal and cognitive skills such as compassion and mindfulness, faculty should consider purposefully modeling these skills to students. Modeling compassion cultivation and mindfulness skills in the context of patient interactions may address student empathy erosion more directly than stress management training alone. This pilot study shows compassion training could be an attractive, efficient option to address burnout by simultaneously promoting student wellness and enhanced patient interactions.

TI  - I Think Therefore I Om: Cognitive Distortions and Coping Style as Mediators for the Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Anxiety, Positive and Negative Affect, and Hope
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined cognitive distortions and coping styles as potential mediators for the effects of mindfulness meditation on anxiety, negative affect, positive affect, and hope in college students. Our pre- and postintervention design had four conditions: control, brief meditation focused on attention, brief meditation focused on loving kindness, and longer meditation combining both attentional and loving kindness aspects of mindfulness. Each group met weekly over the course of a semester. Longer combined meditation significantly reduced anxiety and negative affect and increased hope. Changes in cognitive distortions mediated intervention effects for anxiety, negative affect, and hope. Further research is needed to determine differential effects of types of meditation.

TI  - The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on Depression, Cognition, and Immunity in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Feasibility Study
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based programs have shown a promising effect on several health factors associated with increased risk of dementia and the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia such as depression, stress, cognitive decline, immune system and brain structural and functional changes. Studies on mindfulness in MCI subjects are sparse and frequently lack control intervention groups.Objective: To determine the feasibility and the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) practice on depression, cognition and immunity in MCI compared to cognitive training.Methods: Twenty-eight MCI subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. MBSR group underwent 8-week MBSR program. Control group underwent 8-week cognitive training. Their cognitive and immunological profiles and level of depressive symptoms were examined at baseline, after each 8-week intervention (visit 2, V2) and six months after each intervention (visit 3, V3). MBSR participants completed feasibility questionnaire at V2.Results: Twenty MCI patients completed the study (MBSR group n=12, control group n=8). MBSR group showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms at both V2 (p=0.03) and V3 (p=0.0461) compared to the baseline. There was a minimal effect on cognition - a group comparison analysis showed better psychomotor speed in the MBSR group compared to the control group at V2 (p=0.0493) but not at V3. There was a detectable change in immunological profiles in both groups, more pronounced in the MBSR group. Participants checked only positive/neutral answers concerning the attractivity/length of MBSR intervention. More severe cognitive decline (PVLT=36) was associated with the lower adherence to home practice.Conclusion: MBSR is well-accepted potentially promising intervention with positive effect on cognition, depressive symptoms and immunological profile.

TI  - Effects of animated pedagogical agent-guided loving-kindness meditation on flight attendants' spirituality, mindfulness, subjective wellbeing, and social presence
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) was first practiced by Buddhists and then developed by clinical psychologist. Previous studies on LKM have mainly focused on the impact of real person-guided meditation on depression, anxiety, and other negative psychology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explored the effect and mechanism of media-guided LKM on the improvement of social presence, mindfulness, spirituality, and subjective wellbeing (SWB). From the viewpoint of positive psychology, this study compared the different media effects of animated pedagogical agent (APA)-guided LKM and audio-guided LKM. A total of 82 flight attendants were recruited from airlines; then, they were randomly assigned to two groups: APA group (41 participants) and audio group (41 participants), which both underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention. The aforementioned four main variables were measured pre and post the meditation experiment. The results indicated that both APA-guided meditation and audio-guided meditation significantly improved subjects' spirituality and SWB. Compared with audio-guided meditation, APA-guided meditation significantly improved the subjects' spirituality, SWB, and social presence. Audio-guided meditation has no significant effect on social presence. This study highlights APA-guided meditation has a positive effect on spirituality, SWB, and social presence, which may provide individuals with a simple and easy method to improve their mental health.

TI  - A live-online mindfulness-based intervention for children living with epilepsy and their families: protocol for a randomized controlled trial of Making Mindfulness Matter©
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEpilepsy extends far beyond seizures; up to 80% of children with epilepsy (CWE) may have comorbid cognitive or mental health problems, and up to 50% of parents of CWE are at risk for major depression. Past research has also shown that family environment has a greater influence on children's and parents' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health than epilepsy-related factors. There is a pressing need for low-cost, innovative interventions to improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether an interactive online mindfulness-based intervention program, Making Mindfulness Matter (M3), can be feasibly implemented and whether it positively affects CWE's and parents' HRQOL and mental health (specifically, stress, behavioral, depressive, and anxiety symptoms).MethodsThis parallel RCT was planned to recruit 100 child-parent dyads to be randomized 1:1 to the 8-week intervention or waitlist control and followed over 20weeks. The intervention, M3, will be delivered online and separately to parents and children (ages 4-10years) in groups of 4-8 by non-clinician staff of a local community epilepsy agency. The intervention incorporates mindful awareness, social-emotional learning skills, and positive psychology. It is modeled after the validated school-based MindUP program and adapted for provision online and to include a parent component.DiscussionThis RCT will determine whether this online mindfulness-based intervention is feasible and effective for CWE and their parents. The proposed intervention may be an ideal vector to significantly improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents given its low cost and implementation by community epilepsy agencies.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04020484.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation Increases Social Connectedness
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for social connection is a fundamental human motive, and it is increasingly clear that feeling socially connected confers mental and physical health benefits. However, in many cultures, societal changes are leading to growing social distrust and alienation. Can feelings of social connection and positivity toward others be increased? Is it possible to self-generate these feelings? In this study, the authors used a brief loving-kindness meditation exercise to examine whether social connection could be created toward strangers in a controlled laboratory context. Compared with a closely matched control task, even just a few minutes of loving-kindness meditation increased feelings of social connection and positivity toward novel individuals on both explicit and implicit levels. These results suggest that this easily implemented technique may help to increase positive social emotions and decrease social isolation.

TI  - Combining mindfulness and compassion in the treatment of complex trauma - a theoretical exploration
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA & DISSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trauma exposure is widespread in the general population. Despite the proposal that mindfulness practice could be beneficial for treating persons exposed to traumatic events who go on to develop PTSD and/or correlates of past trauma, there are very few mindfulness-skills programs that directly target trauma survivors. This paper seeks to use existing empirical research and theory to explore the potential and challenges of using mindfulness-based interventions to treat trauma-related problems. Through the lens of the group program, Mindfulness and Compassion: the path to growth after trauma (TMC), we explore the potential of integrating trauma-sensitive mindfulness explicitly with compassion training for trauma survivors. This paper seeks to contribute to development of psychological treatment by the methods of mindfulness and compassion training and how they may be used as a complementary or a stand-alone treatment option in phasebased treatment for complex PTSD.

TI  - MinT-trial: Mindfulness versus cognitive behavioural therapy in Tinnitus patients: protocol for a randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Chronic subjective tinnitus is a condition that affects 5.1% to 42.7% of the population, depending on the definition and studied population. Evidence-based treatment options are limited. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been proven effective to improve quality of life and to diminish tinnitus distress. Positive short-term effects of mindfulness-based interventions on tinnitus distress have been reported; however, the longer term effects remain to be studied.Methods and analysis We designed a monocentre randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and CBT in chronic tinnitus patients. Fifty-four patients (>= 32 on the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), suffering from tinnitus for at least 6 months) will be included in the trial and randomised into one of two intervention groups. One group will receive MBCT, the other group will receive CBT. Our primary objective is to determine whether MBCT is non-inferior to (as good as) CBT on tinnitus distress (TFI) in chronic tinnitus patients at 12 months follow-up after end of therapy. Non-inferiority will be declared if the mean decrease in TFI score for MBCT is no worse than the mean decrease in TFI score in CBT, with statistical variability, with a margin of 13 points. Most secondary objectives (tinnitus severity of problem, tinnitus intrusiveness, quality of life, anxiety, depression, symptoms of psychopathology, perceived tinnitus complaints, coping style (mostly validated questionnaires)) are expected to show non-inferiority to MBCT compared with CBT. We expect a significant difference between MBCT and CBT for mindfulness awareness.Ethics and dissemination This research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the UMC Utrecht (NL67838.041.18, V.4, April 2019). The trial results will be made accessible to the public in a peer-review journal.

TI  - Is meditation always relaxing? Investigating heart rate, heart rate variability, experienced effort and likeability during training of three types of meditation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation is often associated with a relaxed state of the body. However, meditation can also be regarded as a type of mental task and training, associated with mental effort and physiological arousal. The cardiovascular effects of meditation may vary depending on the type of meditation, degree of mental effort, and amount of training. In the current study we assessed heart rate (HR), high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and subjective ratings of effort and likeability during three types of meditation varying in their cognitive and attentional requirements, namely breathing meditation, loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation. In the context of the ReSource project, a one-year longitudinal mental training study, participants practiced each meditation exercise on a daily basis for 3 months. As expected HR and effort were higher during loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared to breathing meditation. With training over time HR and likeability increased, while HF-HRV and the subjective experience of effort decreased. The increase in HR and decrease in HF-HRV over training was higher for loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared to breathing meditation. In contrast to implicit beliefs that meditation is always relaxing and associated with low arousal, the current results show that core meditations aiming at improving compassion and meta-cognitive skills require effort and are associated with physiological arousal compared to breathing meditation. Overall these findings can be useful in making more specific suggestions about which type of meditation is most adaptive for a given context and population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Impact of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Compassion Fatigue of Nurses Working in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit A Randomized Clinical Trial Study
T2  - HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Compassion fatigue is a common complication in nurses, which can lead to burnout, job dissatisfaction, and a decline in the quality of patient care. This study aimed to investigate the impact of loving-kindness meditation on compassion fatigue of nurses working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This cluster-blinded randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 66 NICU nurses in 2 educational hospitals selected. The intervention group received a 1-month online program for daily training and practice of loving-kindness meditation. The control group received miscellaneous files on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The Nursing Compassion Fatigue Inventory (NCFI) was filled out by the 2 groups, before and after the intervention. The results showed that the mean scores of the NCFI in the intervention group decreased significantly compared with before the intervention (P = .002). In comparison with the control group, there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the 2 groups after the intervention (P = .034). Among nurses working in NICU, loving-kindness meditation significantly reduces compassion fatigue after 1 month. These findings support the use of this intervention for nurses.

TI  - Effectiveness of intervention program on the change of glycaemic control in diabetes with depression patients: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies
T2  - PRIMARY CARE DIABETES
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim: The glycaemic control of diabetes with depression was inconsistent from randomized controlled studies. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the effectiveness of intervention methods in diabetes with depression.Methods: This study systematically searched electronic databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, and Cochrane) for studies published up to August 17, 2020. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI were used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on HbA1c. Heterogeneity was esti-mated using the I-2 statistic. Begg's test was used to assess the possible publication bias among studies.Results: Twelve studies of 2444 cases were included in this study. The overall SMD is -0.22 and 95%CI -0.33 to -0.10 in 0-6 months of intervention group. The I-2 and P were 18.4% and 0.26. There are no publication bias tested (z = 0.37, P = 0.72).Conclusion: Cognitive behavioral therapy and mindful self-compassion might be effective method to improve glycaemic control of diabetes with depression in 0-6 months.

TI  - Meditation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Mind-body interventions have shown efficacy in many conditions that have psychosomatic mechanisms, as well as for other pathologies. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of meditation/mindfulness at improving the symptoms severity, quality of life and other associated mood and mental conditions, measured in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A systematic review of randomized controlled trials in adult participants with IBS was conducted. Eight databases were searched for articles. We performed a meta-analysis evaluating the effects of meditation-based therapy on symptomatology, quality of life, anxiety and depression. Out of 604 articles screened, six were selected for quantitative review. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of the mindfulness group and the control group was of -36.95 (95% CI -74.61-0.7), p = 0.054 regarding the IBS symptom score; of 12.58 (95% CI 4.42-20.74), p = 0.003 regarding the IBS quality of life; SMD = 2.8 (95% CI 1.01-4.6), p = 0.002 for spiritual scale; and of 15.49 (95% CI -28.43--2.55), p = 0.019 regarding the pain score in IBS. Our study found that the quality of life and the spiritual scale scores (i.e., mindful awareness) were statistically significantly higher in the mindfulness group, while the pain score was statistically significantly lower in the mindfulness group.

AB  - Accumulating research in education shows that contemplative practices contribute to and foster well-being of individuals in sustainable ways. This bears special importance for teachers, as it affects not only them but also their students. Based on accumulating behavioral and neuroscientific findings, it has been suggested that a key process by which mindfulness meditation enhances self-regulation is the altering of self-awareness. Indeed, accumulated work shows that the underlying networks supporting various types of self-awareness are malleable following meditative practice. However, the field of education has developed independently from the study of the self and its relation to contemplative neuroscience thus far, and to date there is no systematic account linking this accumulating body of knowledge to the field of education or discussing how it might be relevant to teachers.Here we show how incorporating insights from contemplative neuroscience-which are built on the conceptualization and neuroscience of the self-into contemplative pedagogy can inform the field and might even serve as a core underlying mechanism tying together different empirical evidence. This review points to potential neural mechanisms by which mindfulness meditation helps teachers manage stress and promote supportive learning environments, resulting in improved educational outcomes, and thus it has significant implications for educational policy regarding teachers.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation vs Cognitive Processing Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Veterans A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Additional options are needed for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veterans.OBJECTIVE To determine whether group loving-kindness meditation is noninferior to group cognitive processing therapy for treatment of PTSD.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical noninferiority trial assessed PTSD and depression at baseline, posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Veterans were recruited from September 24, 2014, to February 5, 2018, from a large Veternas Affairs medical center in Seattle, Washington. A total of 184 veteran volunteers who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for PTSD were randomized. Data collection was completed November 28, 2018, and data analyses were conducted from December 10, 2018, to November 5, 2019.INTERVENTIONS Each intervention comprised 12 weekly 90-minute group sessions. Loving-kindness meditation (n = 91) involves silent repetition of phrases intended to elicit feelings of kindness for oneself and others. Cognitive processing therapy (n = 93) combines cognitive restructuring with emotional processing of trauma-related content.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Co-primary outcomes were change in PTSD and depression scores over 6-month follow-up, assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; range, 0-80; higher is worse) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS; reported as standardized T-score with mean [SD] of 50 [10] points; higher is worse) depression measures. Noninferiority margins were 5 points on the CAPS-5 and 4 points on the PROMIS depression measure.RESULTS Among the 184 veterans (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [13.1] years; 153 men [83.2%]; 107 White participants [58.2%]) included in the study, 91 (49.5%) were randomized to the loving-kindness group, and 93 (50.5%) were randomized to the cognitive processing group. The mean (SD) baseline CAPS-5 score was 35.5 (11.8) and mean (SD) PROMIS depression score was 60.9 (7.9). A total of 121 veterans (66%) completed 6-month follow-up. At 6 months posttreatment, mean CAPS-5 scores were 28.02 (95% CI, 24.72-31.32) for cognitive processing therapy and 25.92 (95% CI, 22.62-29.23) for loving-kindness meditation (difference, 2.09; 95% CI, -2.59 to 6.78), and mean PROMIS depression scores were 61.22 (95% CI, 59.21-63.23) for cognitive processing therapy and 58.88 (95% CI, 56.86-60.91) for loving-kindness meditation (difference, 2.34; 95% CI, -0.52 to 5.19). In superiority analyses, there were no significant between-group differences in CAPS-5 scores, whereas for PROMIS depression scores, greater reductions were found for loving-kindness meditation vs cognitive processing therapy (for patients attending >= 6 visits, >= 4-point improvement was noted in 24 [39.3%] veterans receiving loving-kindness meditation vs 9 (18.0%) receiving cognitive processing therapy; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among veterans with PTSD, loving-kindness meditation resulted in reductions in PTSD symptoms that were noninferior to group cognitive processing therapy. For both interventions, the magnitude of improvement in PTSD symptoms was modest. Change over time in depressive symptoms was greater for loving-kindness meditation than for cognitive processing therapy.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation - A Queen of Hearts? A Physio-Phenomenological Investigation on the Variety of Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a popular contemplative mental practice. Its purpose is to cultivate feelings of compassion, love, and prosocial motivation, typically through inner visual imagery and benevolent intentions. Previous studies have revealed evidence for various constructive effects of LKM. It remains an open question, however, whether the effects of LKM are exclusively positive in all practitioners. To tackle this question, we collected 55 microphenomenological interviews (MpIs) reflecting subjective experiences during LKM Furthermore, we obtained psychological and biological (oxytocin, cortisol) inter-individual difference measures during a nine-month, longitudinal, mental training study. LKM was predominantly described in positive affective terms and associated with cortisol decrease in accordance with the natural diurnal decline, which reflects its generally non-stressful nature. However, five participants reported experiences such as panic, sadness, and fear. Emotional challenge, as indicated by negative word use during MpIs, was linked to lower scores of self-kindness and higher scores of self-compassionate mindfulness.

TI  - Mindful parenting-A thematic exploration of narratives from Indian mothers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GLOBAL WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionWith the global crisis of COVID-19 continuing, Indian mothers have not received adequate attention with respect to their challenges and mothering experiences. The current study explored mindful parenting practices in a cohort of Indian mothers of children aged 10 years and below that emerged in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19. MethodsIn-depth virtual interviews were conducted with 31 urban Indian mothers to explore their lived experiences of mothering during the global crisis and their engagements with mindful parenting practices. The data were thematically analyzed. Results and DiscussionThe study identified two overarching themes and nine subthemes. The first theme, pandemic-induced stress, included the sub-themes of increased workload, poor support system, lack of time for self, and emotional and physical distress. The second theme of mindful parenting included the sub-themes of awareness as a mother and around the child, acceptance toward self and the child, empathic understanding of self and the child, active engagement with the child, and emotional regulation. Increased workload on all fronts coupled with poor support and a lack of time for self-contributed to exacerbated emotional and physical stress in mothers. They addressed these concerns posed by their lived experiences by engaging in mindful parenting processes in their mothering practices. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mindfulness-based parenting techniques could be explored as possible interventions for mothers to alleviate their distress while drawing attention to larger structural changes and policy-level interventions addressing social issues such as gender inequality and childcare concerns.

TI  - A Component Analysis of the Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) Program for Mindful Parenting by Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) has been shown to be effective in reducing stress and burnout in parents and professional caregivers of children and adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effects of the mindfulness (MB) and positive behavior support (PBS) components against the MBPBS program for mindful parenting. Methods The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e., aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers' requests). Results Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the children's aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition, respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to mothers' requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then PBS. Changes across all variables for both mothers and their children were maintained for 3 years post-intervention. After time and training type were controlled for, meditation time was a significant predictor in reducing aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and in enhancing compliance of the children with mothers' requests. Conclusions Positive outcomes for mothers and their children with ASD were significantly greater in the MBPBS condition, followed by the MB condition, and least in the PBS condition. MBPBS appears to be an effective mindful parenting program on the assessed variables.

TI  - The cultivation of joy: practices from the Buddhist tradition, positive psychology, and yogic philosophy
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emotion of joy is often thought of as the result of an external stimulus. Few traditions explicitly instruct on how to cultivate joy from within. There are a few exceptions to this. First, in the Buddhist tradition, exist several practices by which to cultivate joy. Second, in positive psychology, specific interventions may be gateways to joy. Third, the practice and philosophy of traditional yoga is believed to lead to a state of ultimate joy. We can postulate what joy is and demonstrate why joy is beneficial, but it's equally important to understand the how of joy. As such, future scholarship on the subject of joy must include the exploration of various modalities whichfacilitate the cultivation of joy in our lives and in the lives of others.

T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The main goal of the study was to investigate the effects of a short loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on explicit and implicit evaluations of oneself and disliked public persons. We expected a more positive explicit and implicit evaluation of oneself and a disliked public person after the LKM and a mood improvement. Methods Before and after the implementation of a short LKM vs. imagery task, mood, explicit and implicit evaluations were analyzed in 69 students. Results Our results demonstrated only a reduction in negative and positive mood in both groups and regarding the explicit and implicit tasks, only a significant main effect of picture and a trend for the time*group interaction for mood, implicit and explicit attitudes with medium effect-sizes. Conclusions A possible influence of a short intervention on emotional evaluations should be treated with caution. The claim that a short loving-kindness meditation enhances social connectedness might awake false hopes. This study suggests being careful with the interpretation of single meditation effects and future studies should examine the effects of a long-lasting meditation training on explicit and implicit evaluations of the self and disliked politicians as well as the sustainability of those effects.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a mindfulness-based group intervention (The COndiVIDere program) delivered online to people with MS (PwMS) in the time of COVID-19.Materials and methodsThis is a single-arm longitudinal study with a nested qualitative study. The COndiVIDere program is composed of five weekly sessions (1-h each) plus three booster monthly sessions. Data were collected immediately before the beginning of the program, after the five weekly sessions, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.ResultsFifty PwMS participated in the program. Participants improved in anxiety, stress, loneliness and mindfulness ("non-judgmental inner experience" component). Improvements on most outcomes occurred at post-intervention and reached the statistically significant threshold at 3-month follow-up. Mindfulness improvements keep increasing at each time point. Qualitative data confirmed the COndiVIDere program feasibility and the positive psychological impacts on participants. Mindfulness, compassion and the group setting were considered the most important active elements.ConclusionsStudy findings support COndiVIDere feasibility and effectiveness with PwMS and its broad applicability in this population.COndiVIDere is a highly structured, brief, manualized, online mindfulness-based interventionIt is effective in improving participants' anxiety, stress, loneliness and mindfulnessIt can be effectively delivered online to people with MS with varied socio-demographic and clinical characteristics

TI  - The effects of a mindfulness-based lifestyle program for adults with Parkinson's disease: a mixed methods, wait list controlled randomised control study
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative disease in developed countries. Current treatment for PD is pharmacologically focused and can have significant side-effects. There is increasing interest in holistic approaches including mindfulness to help manage the challenges associated with living with PD. We hypothesised that there would be an improvement in PD associated function and wellbeing in participants after participating in a 6-week mindfulness-based lifestyle program, and that these improvements would be sustainable at 6 months. Our primary objective was to determine changes in function and wellbeing associated with PD.Methods: An exploratory prospective, mixed-method, randomised control trial incorporating a before and after design with a waitlist control, with an embedded qualitative component was conducted in 2012-2013. Participants included community living adults with disability congruent to H&Y Stage 2 PD, aged 18-75, fluent in spoken and written English and able to attend at least four of six sessions of the program. Participants were randomised to the intervention or wait-list control groups at two locations. All participants in the wait-list control group eventually received the intervention. Two randomisation codes were created for each location. Allocation to the intervention or wait-list control was by random number generation. The program facilitator and participants were blinded to participant data.Results: Group 1 included 35 participants and group 2 (the waitlist control), 37. Data was analysed from 24 (group 1) and 33 (group 2) participants. The intervention group, compared to the waitlist control, showed a small improvement in function and wellbeing associated with PD immediately after the program (t-score = -0. 59) and at 6-month post intervention (t-score = -1.42) as reported by the PDQ-39 SI. However this finding was not significant (p = 0.56 and 0.16 respectively). A small yet significant effect size (beta = 0.23) in PDQ-39 ADL was reported in group 1 after 6-months post-intervention. This showed a positive improvement in the ADL as reported by group 1 after 6-months (t-score -1.8, p = 0.04). Four secondary measures are reported.Conclusions: Our findings suggest mindfulness-based lifestyle programs have potential to assist participants in managing the ongoing difficulties associated with a neurological condition such as Parkinson's disease. Importantly, our study shows promise for the long term benefits of such programs. Improvements to participant activities in daily living and mindfulness were retained at 6-months post intervention. A more definitive study should be conducted in a larger sample of PD patients to further explore these findings and their impact on reducing stress and anxiety in PD patients.

AB  - Among the modern versions of mindfulness, mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) has played the key role in introducing mindfulness practice to the field of psychology and medicine. In fact, the efforts to integrate mindfulness into psychology have resulted in further adaptation of MBSR into more secular and psychological forms as well as the creation of a number of mindfulness measures such as the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills, and the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale. At the same time there is increasing scrutiny of mindfulness that goes beyond the initial positive efficacy studies resulting in several important questions being raised. These range from the absence of an operational definition of mindfulness as well as little evidence for the mechanisms of mindfulness that account for outcome changes for various psychopathology and medical conditions. Questions about the defining characteristics of mindfulness are also being raised such as the lack of differentiation between the features called attention and awareness and the interchangeable use of the two terms in modern descriptions of mindfulness. Such questions resonate with traditional practitioners of Buddhist contemplative psychology for whom attention signifies an every-changing factor of consciousness, while awareness refers to a stable and specific state of consciousness.

TI  - Mindfulness-based online intervention increases well-being and decreases stress after Covid-19 lockdown
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness interventions were shown to be effective in improving well-being and reducing perceived stress in several conditions. These effects were also found in online mindfulness-based training, especially in employees in organizational environments. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of an online mindfulness intervention on healthy employees, especially after the first Italian Covid-19 lockdown. Participants in the intervention group underwent an 8-week mindfulness online training program based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocol compared to a control (no-intervention) group. All participants filled in weekly surveys for the whole intervention duration via online questionnaires to measure their habits, mindfulness (FFMQ-15), emotion regulation (ERQ), positive and negative affect (PANAS), depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21), resilience (RSA) and insomnia (ISI). 69 participants in the intervention group and 63 in the no-treatment control group were considered in the longitudinal analyses. We found significant differences between the intervention and control groups over time in the measures of mindfulness (in particular the nonreactivity subscale), positive affect, depression, and insomnia. Moreover, we found that the frequency of practice and ease perceived in practicing were positively correlated to several indices of well-being (mindfulness, positive affect, cognitive reappraisal) and negatively correlated to several indices of stress (negative affect, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, expressive suppression). These results show the importance and effectiveness of online mindfulness training programs to cope with stress among employees, especially after the Covid-19 lockdown.

TI  - Fostering Self-Compassion and Loving-Kindness in Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder: A Randomized Pilot Study
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this randomized pilot study is to investigate the effects of a short training programme in loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKM/CM) in patients with borderline personality disorder. Patients were allocated to LKM/CM or mindfulness continuation training (control group). Patients in the LKM/CM group showed greater changes in Acceptance compared with the control group. Remarkable changes in borderline symptomatology, self-criticism and self-kindness were also observed in the LKM/CM group. Mechanistic explanations and therapeutic implications of the findings are discussed. Highlights:Three weeks of loving-kindness and compassion meditations increased acceptance of the present-moment experience in patients with borderline personality disorder.Significant improvements in the severity of borderline symptoms, self-criticism, mindfulness, acceptance and self-kindness were observed after the LKM/CM intervention.LKM/CM is a promising complementary strategy for inclusion in mindfulness-based interventions and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy for treating core symptoms in borderline personality disorder.

AB  - Mindfulness-, compassion-, and acceptance-based (i.e., "third wave") psychotherapies are effective for treating chronic pain conditions. Many of these programs require that patients engage in the systematic home practice of meditation experiences so they can develop meditation skills. This systematic review aimed at evaluating the frequency, duration, and effects of home practice in patients with chronic pain undergoing a "third wave" psychotherapy. A comprehensive database search for quantitative studies was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Sciences Core Collection; 31 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reviewed studies tended to indicate a pattern of moderately frequent practice (around four days/week), with very high variability in terms of time invested; most studies observed significant associations between the amount of practice and positive health outcomes. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy were the most common interventions and presented low levels of adherence to home practice (39.6% of the recommended time). Some studies were conducted on samples of adolescents, who practiced very few minutes, and a few tested eHealth interventions with heterogeneous adherence levels. In conclusion, some adaptations may be required so that patients with chronic pain can engage more easily and, thus, effectively in home meditation practices.

TI  - A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Online-Treatment with Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and Positive Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study Protocol
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Research suggests the use of different forms of therapy as a way of decreasing dropout rates in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The psychotherapies to be assessed in this study are trial-based cognitive therapy (TBCT), mindfulness-based health promotion (MBHP) and positive psychotherapy (PPT). Objectives: (1) to assess the online efficacy of TBCT compared to MBHP and PPT to reduce the symptoms of PTSD in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; (2) to compare the efficacy of these psychotherapies in improving anxiety, depression, guilt and in promoting well-being; and (3) to describe how professionals perceive online treatment. Methods: A randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical trial will be conducted, with three separate arms. An estimated sample of 135 patients will receive either TBCT, MBHP or PPT and will be treated through online, individual, weekly visits, totaling 14 sessions. The primary outcome will be CAPS-5 and secondary outcomes will be HADS and WHO-5. The variables used to mediate these outcomes will be the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI), Negative Core Beliefs Inventory (NCBI) and the California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS-P). Expected results: PTSD symptoms are expected to be reduced after TBCT, MBHP and PPT. No statistical difference is expected to be found among the three. Discussion: The present study will evaluate and contribute towards the development of new psychotherapeutic options for patients with PTSD. The results of this study will allow the dissemination of new effective and adaptable interventions for patients with PTSD.

AB  - BackgroundThis study investigated whether mindfulness training increases athletes' mindfulness and flow experience and decreases sport-specific anxiety and sport-specific pessimism.MethodsCyclists were assigned to an eight-week mindfulness intervention, which incorporated a mindful spin-bike training component, or a wait-list control condition. Participants completed baseline and post-test measures of mindfulness, flow, sport-anxiety, and sport-related pessimistic attributions.ResultsAnalyses of covariance showed significant positive effects on mindfulness, flow, and pessimism for the 27 cyclists in the mindfulness intervention condition compared with the 20 cyclists in the control condition. Changes in mindfulness experienced by the intervention participants were positively associated with changes in flow.ConclusionsResults suggest that mindfulness-based interventions tailored to specific athletic pursuits can be effective in facilitating flow experiences.

TI  - Structural changes in socio-affective networks: Multi-modal MRI findings in long-term meditation practitioners
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal was to assess the effects of long-term mental training in socio-affective skills on structural brain networks. We studied a group of long-term meditation practitioners (LTMs) who have focused on cultivating socio-affective skills using loving-kindness and compassion meditation for an average of 40k h, comparing these to meditation-naive controls. To maximize homogeneity of prior practice, LTMs were included only if they had undergone extensive full-time meditation retreats in the same center. MRI-based cortical thickness analysis revealed increased thickness in the LTM cohort relative to meditation-native controls in fronto-insular cortices. To identify functional networks relevant for the generation of socio-affective states, structural imaging analysis were complemented by fMRI analysis in LTMs, showing amplitude increases during a loving-kindness meditation session relative to non-meditative rest in multiple prefrontal and insular regions bilaterally. Importantly, functional findings partially overlapped with regions of cortical thickness increases in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, suggesting that these regions may play a central role in the generation of emotional states relevant for the meditative practice. Our multi-modal MRI approach revealed structural changes in LTMs who have cultivated loving-kindness and compassion for a significant period of their life in functional networks activated by these practices. These preliminary cross-sectional findings motivate future longitudinal work studying brain plasticity following the regular practice of skills aiming at enhancing human altruism and prosocial motivation.

TI  - The Development of the Difficulties During Meditation Involving Immeasurable Attitudes Scale
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Four Immeasurables Meditations (FIM) are a group of meditations rooted in Buddhism that cultivate pro-social attitudes. Previous studies have reported common difficulties during the practice of the FIM, yet there is no specific measure for those difficulties. The current study intended to develop the Difficulties during Meditation involving Immeasurable Attitudes Scale (DMIAS) to measure two aspects of common difficulties during the FIM practice: lack of concentration (LOC) and lack of pro-social attitudes (LOP). A total of 506 meditation novices were used in four studies. In study 1, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with the data from a one-time practice of loving-kindness meditation was used to produce the 12-item DMIAS with two independent factors that were positively correlated (LOC and LOP). Studies 2, 3, and 4 validated the DMIAS in one-time practices of loving-kindness meditation, appreciative joy meditation, and compassion meditation, respectively. Across studies 2 to 4, confirmatory factor analyses supported the two-factor structure of the DMIAS, and both LOP and LOC had negative correlations with the other-focused positive emotions generated by the meditations. Although manipulations of the target to be blessed (study 3) and the length of practice (study 4) only had small impacts on the effects of meditation, the pattern of correlations between emotional outcomes and certain factors of the DMIAS was significantly different between the manipulated conditions. In summary, the DMIAS is a useful tool in understanding the difficulties during the FIM practice, and the current study also illustrated how technical details of the FIM influences the effects of the FIM practice.

TI  - Does loving-kindness meditation elicit empathic emotions? The moderating role of self-discrepancy and self-esteem on guilt
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our understanding of the emotions elicited by loving-kindness meditation (LKM) at early stages of practice is limited, despite the influence that these emotions may have on later engagement. Past work suggests that LKM may elicit emotional ambivalence at early stages of the practice, but it is still unclear whether the content of LKM activates this ambivalence and who is more likely to experience it. Given the specific content of LKM, we defend that this meditation is likely to elicit empathetic emotions, both positive (compassion and gratitude) and negative (guilt), to a greater extent than an active control. Guilt is likely to be elicited by memories of incidents where naive meditators were not able to experience compassion and/or by the difficulties in sending compassionate love to disliked others during the meditation. Furthermore, individuals with greater self-discrepancy and lower self-esteem are more likely to experience guilt. These hypotheses were tested in two experimental studies with community and student samples (n = 55 and n = 33, respectively) and using a brief intervention. The results support the hypotheses. These findings have implications for instructors of LKM, especially when organizing meditation practices with naive meditators who should be aware of the potential negative emotions elicited by this meditation.

TI  - Training in Mindfulness or Loving-kindness Meditation Is Associated with Lower Variability in Social Connectedness Across Time
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Research demonstrates that meditation interventions tend to positively influence social well-being. Yet, prior research has exclusively examined meditation in relation to average levels of social outcomes (e.g., social connectedness), despite other work demonstrating variability or fluctuations in social functioning play a distinct role in contributing to well-being. This study examined the hypothesis that training in mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation would predict lower variability in social connectedness, even accounting for their positive influence on average levels of social connectedness. Moreover, this study also examined the hypothesis that lower variability in positive and negative emotions would mediate the link between training in meditation and reduced variability in social connectedness. Methods These hypotheses were tested using a randomized study of 224 mid-life adults. Participants received training in either mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation for 6 weeks. They reported their daily social connectedness and emotions for 2 weeks prior to the training, 6 weeks during the training, and 3 weeks after the training. Results Consistent with hypotheses, results demonstrated that participants in both meditation groups reported lower variability in social connectedness across the course of the intervention, even accounting for average levels of connectedness. Moreover, lower positive and negative affective variability partially mediated the association between time (training in meditation) and reduced variability in social connectedness. Conclusions These results suggest that (a) meditation may help to smooth social ups and downs across time and that (b) it may do so via its association with reduced affective variability.

TI  - Differential Effects of Two Contemplative Practice-based Programs for Health Care Professionals
T2  - PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was testing the differential effectiveness of two interventions to improve Majorcan primary care professionals' quality of life: Mindful-Based Stress Reduction Training (MBSRT) and Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT). 50 professionals participated in the study; 81% were women. We evaluated mindfulness, empathy, self-compassion, and professional quality of life. Results showed statistically significant effects of the programs on the improvement of mindfulness, self-compassion, and professional quality of life, and differential effects on two dimensions of mindfulness, acting with awareness and non-reacting to inner experience, and on the dimension of burnout of the professional quality of life, in all the cases favoring the MBSRT group. The study concludes that this type of interventions is adequate to improve the aforementioned variables, with better efficacy of the MBSRT for this type of participants.

TI  - A brief mindfulness-based intervention for stress, pain, emotion and attention regulation in military service members with mild traumatic brain injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThe primary aim of this study was to conduct an open pilot clinical trial of a brief mindfulness-based intervention for persistent postconcussion symptoms that occur after mild traumatic brain injury in military service members. For many service members, operational tempo and other time constraints may prevent them from completing a standard mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Thus, this study sought to examine the effectiveness of a five-session intervention called mindfulness-based stress, pain, emotion, and attention regulation (MSPEAR).MethodsParticipants were active duty service members with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and persisting postconcussion symptoms, all of whom were recruited from an outpatient TBI rehabilitation program at a military treatment facility. Of the 38 service members that were initially enrolled, 25 completed the 5-session MSPEAR intervention, and 20 returned for a 5-week follow-up evaluation. Questionnaires assessing perceived stress, positive affect, pain interference and catastrophizing, sleep disturbances, perceived behavioral and attention regulation, self-efficacy and satisfaction with life were administered at preintervention, postintervention, and at 5-week follow-up intervals. Neuropsychological testing at preintervention and 5-week follow-up included performance validity measures, attention, working memory, and executive function measures. T-tests were run to compare for questionnaire measures at preintervention (Time 1) to postintervention (Time 2). Repeated analysis of variances were conducted to compare questionnaire and neuropsychological measures at Time 1, Time 2, and at Time 3 which is the 5-week follow-up.ResultsImprovements in perceived stress, positive affect, behavioral regulation, metacognition, sleep disturbance, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life were found immediately after the MSPEAR intervention and were maintained at the 5-week follow-up. Magnification and helplessness aspects of pain catastrophizing improved when comparing preintervention to the 5-week follow-up. Pain interference was not significantly different across study assessment times. Neuropsychological testing revealed improvements in sustained attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control when comparing preintervention to the 5-week follow-up assessment.ConclusionsThe MSPEAR intervention appears to show promise as a brief and effective therapy for specific postconcussion symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury in military service members. Each of the components of MSPEAR including stress, pain catastrophizing, emotion and attention regulation showed improvements in this study, and bears further investigation in a larger scale, preferably randomized controlled trial in those active duty military service members who experience persisting symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury.

TI  - Effects of Mindful Practices on Terror of Mortality: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Early Buddhist thought clearly recognizes the need for learning how to face one's own mortality, for which purpose mindfulness practice has a central role to play. Fear of death has also been studied in cognitive psychology, leading to what is known as the terror management theory. Actual research evidence in psychology has already shown that mindfulness practice may reduce fear and anxiety in general. However, there is a lack of research examining the specific effects of brief mindfulness practices on the fear of death and dying. In this study we tested the hypothesis that brief mindfulness practices used daily over a period of 6 weeks will result in a reduction of the fear of death and dying when compared to brief contemplative practices used as an active control condition.Methods Participants (n = 89) were randomly assigned to the mindfulness (n = 44) and the contemplation (n = 45) conditions and completed validated scales measuring four distinct fears related to either the process of dying or the final event of death (dying of oneself, death of oneself, dying of others, and death of others), mindfulness, and self-compassion at baseline, post-intervention (at 6 weeks) and follow up (1-3 weeks after the end of the 6-week intervention). ANOVA was used to investigate the effects of both interventions on outcome variables over time and between groups.Results Both mindfulness and contemplative practices were equally effective in reducing fear related to dying of oneself and death of others while increasing fear of dying of others, mindfulness, and self-compassion. No significant intervention effects were found for fear related to death of oneself only.Conclusions These results suggest that fears related to dying of oneself and death of others can be reduced using both mindfulness and contemplative practices that may simultaneously increase mindfulness and self-compassion.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction A meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: An increasing number of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) studies are being conducted with nonclinical populations, but very little is known about their effectiveness.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, mechanisms of actions, and moderators of MBSR for nonclinical populations.Data sources: A systematic review of studies published in English journals in Medline, CINAHL or Alt HealthWatch from the first available date until September 19, 2014.Study selection: Any quantitative study that used MBSR as an intervention, that was conducted with healthy adults, and that investigated stress or anxiety.Results: A total of 29 studies (n = 2668) were included. Effect-size estimates suggested that MBSR is moderately effective in pre-post analyses (n = 26; Hedge's g = .55; 95% CI [.44,.66], p < .00001) and in between group analyses (n = 18; Hedge's g = .53; 95% Cl [.41,.64], p < .00001). The obtained results were maintained at an average of 19 weeks of follow-up. Results suggested large effects on stress, moderate effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life, and small effects on burnout. When combined, changes in mindfulness and compassion measures correlated with changes in clinical measures at post-treatment and at follow-up. However, heterogeneity was high, probably due to differences in the study design, the implemented protocol, and the assessed outcomes.Conclusions: MBSR is moderately effective in reducing stress, depression, anxiety and distress and in ameliorating the quality of life of healthy individuals; however, more research is warranted to identify the most effective elements of MBSR.

TI  - Self-Compassion When Coping With Venture Obstacles: Loving-Kindness Meditation and Entrepreneurial Fear of Failure
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Entrepreneurial fear of failure is a ubiquitous yet aversive experience with critical implications for entrepreneurial action and well-being. To understand how entrepreneurs can effectively cope with fear-inducing obstacles, we hypothesize and experimentally test the extent to which self-compassion, cultivated through Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM), counteracts entrepreneurs' fear of failure when facing a threatening venture obstacle. Compared to an active control group, entrepreneurs exposed to a brief guided LKM showed higher self-compassion, which, in turn, was associated with lower fear reactivity. We offer novel contributions to entrepreneurship theory and practice by highlighting the role of meditation and self-compassion in building entrepreneurial resilience.

TI  - Examining Individual Differences in Wellbeing, Anxiety and Depression in Psoriasis Using a Clinically Modified Buddhist Psychological Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY IN MEDICAL SETTINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Psoriasis patients can experience a range of psychosocial difficulties, which can lead to issues with wellbeing, anxiety and depression. Mindfulness-based interventions have positive impacts on these outcomes; however, there is a need to identify the mechanisms of action of such interventions. This study attempts to do so by examining individual differences in psoriasis patients' wellbeing, anxiety and depression using a clinically modified Buddhist psychological model (CBPM). Psoriasis patients (N = 285) and (N = 209) completed measures of each CBPM component at time 1 and 2. SEM analyses found that a direct and mediated effect of CBPM model was a good fit to the participant's data. This study suggests that non-attachment, aversion, acceptance and self-compassion could have a direct effect on the wellbeing, anxiety and depression of psoriasis patients and an indirect effect through reduced worry and rumination. This study provided preliminary evidence for the CBPM as being a useful explanatory framework of psoriasis patients' anxiety, depression and wellbeing.

TI  - The effects of loving-kindness interventions on positive and negative mental health outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Loving-kindness meditations involve sending feelings of kindness and care to a series of people including oneself, loved ones, strangers, and all beings. Loving-kindness interventions (LKIs), which include knowledge and/or practice related to loving-kindness, have been gaining attention as a potential intervention for improving mental health in adults. This meta-analysis synthesized the effects of LKIs on both positive (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, positive affect) and negative (i.e., negative affect, psychological symptoms) indices of mental health across comparison types (i.e., passive control, active control, alternative treatment) and general sample types (i.e., community, university), and explored characteristics of LKIs that may impact their effectiveness (i.e., intervention format, intervention length, presence/absence of a live facilitator). Following a systematic review of six databases in November 2023, 23 randomized controlled studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Relative to passive control groups, LKIs had positive effects on mindfulness, compassion, positive affect, negative affect, and psychological symptoms; these effects were non-significant relative to active control groups and alternative therapeutic treatments. Notably, the effects of LKIs did not differ as a function of sample type, intervention format, intervention length, or the presence/absence of a live facilitator. Findings provide support for the effectiveness of LKIs relative to passive control conditions, as well as their potential comparability to alternative evidence-based therapeutic treatments, and provide insight into resource-effective approaches to the delivery of effective LKIs. However, additional studies are needed to confirm the impacts of LKIs relative to other interventions in the field.

TI  - Integrated Behavioral Supports: Combining PBIS and SEL at Tier 2
T2  - SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Social, emotional, and behavioral problems present many issues and concerns for youth, families, and schools. Schools have adopted various frameworks of prevention and intervention meant to assist with such concerns. Two widely used frameworks are positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) and social-emotional learning (SEL). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness, implementation fidelity, and social validity of an integrated approach (PBIS + SEL) at Tier 2 in relation to students' prosocial classroom behavior. This was done using a common PBIS intervention, check-in/check-out (CICO), in conjunction with a common SEL intervention, mindful breathing (MB). Results suggest that CICO and CICO + MB may both be effective, feasible, and socially valid strategies for increasing prosocial classroom behavior and reducing externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in youth. More specifically, the MB component may produce small but additional valued outcomes compared to CICO alone. Future research should further investigate this value-added effect of MB when used with CICO for social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes as well as other possible methods of integration at Tier 2.

TI  - The MEDITAGING study: protocol of a two-armed randomized controlled study to compare the effects of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program against a health promotion program in older migrants in Luxembourg
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Migration is a phenomenon worldwide, with older migrants, particularly those with fewer socioeconomic resources, having an increased risk of developing adverse cognitive and health outcomes and social isolation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to validate interventions that promote healthy aging in this population. Previous studies have shown a positive impact of mindfulness based-stress reduction (MBSR) on outcomes such as cognition and sleep. However, only a few studies verified its potential in older adults, especially with vulnerable populations such as migrants. This article presents the protocol of the MEDITAGING study, which is the first to investigate the MBSR effects in migrants aged >= 55 in comparison to a health promotion program.Methods MEDITAGING is a two-arm randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, which will include older Portuguese-speaking migrants (n = 90). Participants are randomized to the MBSR or a health promotion program. Both interventions are conducted in groups over a total of 8 weeks, incorporating weekly meetings, an additional 4-hour class, and extra at-home tasks. The health promotion program has the same structure as the MBSR but comprises different activities related to dementia prevention, healthy habits, cognitive stimulation, sleeping, nutrition, watercolor painting, and physical activity. The assessment of executive functioning, physiological stress measures, self-reported questionnaires, and qualitative interviews are conducted at baseline, after 8 weeks (post-intervention), and at a follow-up session (from one to 3 months thereafter). Analyzes will be conducted using a modified intention-to-treat approach (all participants with at least 3 days of participation in the group-sessions and one post-intervention observation).Discussion This study will test effects of a mindfulness-based intervention against an active control condition in older adult migrants, which few studies have addressed.

TI  - Self/Other Referential Processing Following Mindfulness and Loving-Kindness Meditation
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The immediate outcomes of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on experimental measures of explicit and implicit self-and other-referential processing (SRP-ORP) have not been investigated previously. In this study, undergraduate students (n=104) were randomized to a single-session practice of MM, LKM, or reading control and completed self-report measures of decentering and positive affect directed toward self and other. Participants also completed an experimental measure of valenced SRP-ORP. Practice of both meditations was associated with increased decentering and positive affect relative to reading control, although self-reported response to MM and LKM did not significantly differ. Following the meditation, whereas participants randomized to MM evidenced an expected self-positivity bias in positive affective response and reaction time during an experimental SRP-ORP task, participants randomized to LKM did not. LKM, as uniquely involving the intentional cultivation of positive emotion toward both self and other, may be associated with a relative normalization of the self-positivity bias. Individual differences in response to SRP-ORP were also examined as a function of traits related to mindfulness and loving-kindness, in addition to as a function of variability in experiential response to MM and LKM. Study limitations and future research directions are also discussed.

TI  - The Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in Primary Care: A Meta-Analytic Review
T2  - ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - PURPOSE Positive effects have been reported after mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in diverse clinical and nonclinical populations. Primary care is a key health care setting for addressing common chronic conditions, and an effective MBI designed for this setting could benefit countless people worldwide. Meta-analyses of MBIs have become popular, but little is known about their efficacy in primary care. Our aim was to investigate the application and efficacy of MBIs that address primary care patients.METHODS We performed a meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials addressing the effect of MBIs in adult patients recruited from primary care settings. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and Cochrane guidelines were followed. Effect sizes were calculated with the Hedges g in random effects models.RESULTS The meta-analyses were based on 6 trials having a total of 553 patients. The overall effect size of MBI compared with a control condition for improving general health was moderate (g = 0.48; P = .002), with moderate heterogeneity (I-2 = 59; P <.05). We found no indication of publication bias in the overall estimates. MBIs were efficacious for improving mental health (g = 0.56; P = .007), with a high heterogeneity (I-2 = 78; P <.01), and for improving quality of life (g = 0.29; P = .002), with a low heterogeneity (I-2 = 0; P >. 05).CONCLUSIONS Although the number of randomized controlled trials applying MBIs in primary care is still limited, our results suggest that these interventions are promising for the mental health and quality of life of primary care patients. We discuss innovative approaches for implementing MBIs, such as complex intervention and stepped care.

TI  - Gut Microbiota Associated With Effectiveness And Responsiveness to Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Improving Trait Anxiety
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveMindfulness-based interventions have been widely demonstrated to be effective in reducing stress, alleviating mood disorders, and improving quality of life; however, the underlying mechanisms remained to be fully understood. Along with the advanced research in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, this study aimed to explore the impact of gut microbiota on the effectiveness and responsiveness to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) among high trait anxiety populations. DesignA standard MBCT was performed among 21 young adults with high trait anxiety. A total of 29 healthy controls were matched for age and sex. The differences in gut microbiota between the two groups were compared. The changes in fecal microbiota and psychological indicators were also investigated before and after the intervention. ResultsCompared with healthy controls, we found markedly decreased bacterial diversity and distinctive clusters among high trait anxiety populations, with significant overgrowth of bacteria such as Streptococcus, Blautia, and Romboutsia, and a decrease in genera such as Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus_3, and Lachnoclostridium. Moreover, MBCT attenuated trait anxiety and depression, improved mindfulness and resilience, and increased the similarity of gut microbiota to that of healthy controls. Notably, a high presence of intestinal Subdoligranulum pre-MBCT was associated with increased responsiveness to MBCT. Decreases in Subdoligranulum post-MBCT were indicative of ameliorated trait anxiety. The tryptophan metabolism pathways were significantly over-represented among high responders compared to low responders. ConclusionThe significantly increased diversity post-MBCT added evidence to gut-brain communication and highlighted the utility of mycobiota-focused strategies for promoting the effectiveness and responsiveness of the MBCT to improve trait anxiety.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on objective and subjective sleep parameters in women with breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer survivors (MBSR(BC)) on multiple measures of objective and subjective sleep parameters among breast cancer survivors (BCS).MethodsData were collected using a two-armed randomized controlled design among BCS enrolled in either a 6-week MBSR(BC) program or a usual care (UC) group with a 12-week follow-up. The present analysis is a subset of the larger parent trial ( Identifier: NCT01177124). Seventy-nine BCS participants (mean age 57years), stages 0-III, were randomly assigned to either the formal (in-class) 6-week MBSR(BC) program or UC. Subjective sleep parameters (SSP) (i.e., sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) and objective sleep parameters (OSP) (i.e., actigraphy) were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12weeks after completing the MBSR(BC) or UC program.ResultsResults showed indications of a positive effect of MBSR(BC) on OSP at 12weeks on sleep efficiency (78.2% MBSR(BC) group versus 74.6% UC group, p=0.04), percent of sleep time (81.0% MBSR(BC) group versus 77.4% UC group, p=0.02), and less number waking bouts (93.5 in MBSR(BC) group versus 118.6 in the UC group, p<0.01). Small nonsignificant improvements were found in SSP in the MBSR(BC) group from baseline to 6weeks (PSQI total score, p=0.09). No significant relationship was observed between minutes of MBSR(BC) practice and SSP or OSP.ConclusionsThese data suggest that MBSR(BC) may be an efficacious treatment to improve objective and subjective sleep parameters in BCS.

TI  - Using health psychology to help patients: promoting wellbeing.
T2  - British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This article explores the construct of wellbeing. Research concerning the relationship between subjective wellbeing and health is discussed. Key components of wellbeing that are important to health include 'sense of coherence', 'optimism' and 'benefit finding and post-traumatic growth'. A range of positive psychology interventions that aim to increase positive thoughts, feelings and emotions in order to improve wellbeing have been developed. Mindfulness-based approaches to improving wellbeing are especially popular and are evidence based. These focus on helping the individual to develop an awareness of the present with acceptance and attention. Instead of trying to change uncomfortable thoughts or feelings, the individual practices accepting these, without judgement. Nurses can draw on the information in this article to provide evidence-based advice and guidance to help improve their patients' and their own wellbeing.

TI  - Training Emotion Cultivates Morality: How Loving-Kindness Meditation Hones Compassion and Increases Prosocial Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional moral philosophy has long focused on rationality, principled thinking, and good old-fashioned willpower, but recent evidence strongly suggests that moral judgments and prosocial behavior are more heavily influenced by emotion and intuition. As the evidence mounts, rational traditions emphasizing deliberative analysis and conscious decision making are called into question. The first section highlights some compelling evidence supporting the primacy of affective states in motivating moral judgments and behavior. The real challenge is finding a way to align intuition with desired behavior. In cool reflective states, one may desire to be a kind and loving person. But when it is time to act, the moment is often accompanied by strong affect-laden intuitions. I argue that if affective states are the primary motivators of behavior, then moral sentiments must be trained through habituation in order to increase prosocial behavior. The second section provides empirical evidence linking emotional training with increased prosociality. To highlight this connection, focus is placed on the relationship between habitual meditation training, compassion, and prosocial behavior. Recent studies by Antoine Lutz, Richard Davidson, Susanne Leiberg, and others show that various meditation practices can dramatically affect the human person at various levels, i.e., increased physical health, neural restructuring, regulation and development of emotions, and increased helping behavior, to name a few. The current article focuses on the impact the habit of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has on compassion and prosocial behavior. Recent studies strongly support the conclusion that LKM training hones compassion and ultimately leads to an increase in compassionate behavior.

TI  - Developing a Mindfulness Skills-Based Training Program for Resident Physicians
T2  - FAMILY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Resident physicians experience a high level of stress. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to offer medical students and physicians a healthier way to relate to daily stressors. We developed and pilot tested a mindfulness training program and assessed its impact on resident physician burnout and resilience.METHODS: The residency program offered 17 family medicine residents a 10-hour mindfulness training over the course of 2 months in 2016. Residents were encouraged, but not mandated, to attend. Experienced Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction teachers and a family physician/integrative health fellow cotaught the program. A research team qualitatively assessed deidentified, postintervention resident interviews. Residents completed four quantitative questionnaires preintervention, immediately postintervention, and 3 months postintervention. A t score was calculated to assess for statistical significance.RESULTS: Three residents (18%) attended all five training sessions, seven residents (41%) completed at least four sessions, and 16 residents (94%) completed either one or two sessions. Eight residents completed the postintervention interview. Twelve, nine and 14 residents completed the four questionnaires at the three time points, respectively. Qualitative results identified multiple personal/professional benefits of participating in mindfulness training, and we found a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress and increase in mindful awareness from pre- to postintervention (P<.05).CONCLUSIONS: A resident physician mindfulness training program can be reasonably integrated into the residency schedule as part of the wellness curriculum required by the Accrediation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Preliminary results show potential for personal growth and positive changes in patient relationships.

TI  - 'I can't accept that feeling': Relationships between interoceptive awareness, mindfulness and eating disorder symptoms in females with, and at-risk of an eating disorder
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness based therapies (MBTs) for eating disorders show potential benefit for outcomes yet evidence is scarce regarding the mechanisms by which they influence remission from symptoms. One way that mindfulness approaches create positive outcomes is through enhancement of emotion regulation skills. Maladaptive emotion regulation is a key psychological feature of all eating disorders. The aim of the current study was to identify facets of emotion regulation involved in the relationship between mindfulness and maladaptive eating behaviours. In three cross-sectional studies, clinical (n=39) and non-clinical (n=137 and 119) female participants completed: 1) the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) eating specific scales (drive-for-thinness and bulimia) and the EDI psychological symptom scales (emotion dysregulation and interoceptive deficits); and 2) mindfulness, impulsivity, and emotion regulation questionnaires. In all samples mindfulness was significantly and inversely associated with EDI eating and psychological symptom scales, and impulsivity. In non-clinical samples interoceptive deficits mediated the relationship between mindfulness and EDI eating specific scales. Non-acceptance of emotional experience, a facet of interoceptive awareness, mediated the relationship between mindfulness and eating specific EDI scores. Further investigations could verify relationships identified so that mindfulness based approaches can be optimised to enhance emotion regulation skills in sufferers, and those at risk, of eating disorders.

TI  - Imagination-based loving-kindness meditation and focused attention meditation temporarily enhance responses to pain in different ways: an ERP study
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Imagination-based loving-kindness meditation (ibLKM), a new method that combines blessing and imagination developed from the scriptures of Zhiyi, has recently been proposed. The current study aims to examine one of the possible effects of this method through an empirical research approach: the enhancement of responses to pain. In the present study, 59 participants in three groups practiced ibLKM, focused attention meditation (FAM), and watched an unrelated video, respectively. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from participants who were presented with painful and non-painful pictures before and after meditation practices. Participants were asked to judge whether the stimulus was a painful picture or a non-painful picture. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses revealed that the LPP amplitudes over the central-parietal area elicited by the painful pictures were significantly more positive than those before the meditation practices in the ibLKM and FAM groups. The P3 amplitudes over the central-parietal area were significantly more positive in the posttest than in the pretest when viewing painful pictures in the FAM group. In contrast, in the ibLKM, the P3 amplitudes were not significantly different in the pretest and posttest when viewing painful pictures. These results suggested that ibLKM and FAM temporarily enhance responses to pain in different ways.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Nonpharmacological Interventions for Informal Dementia Caregivers: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND AGING
M3  - Review
AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of 131 randomized controlled trials, published between 2006 and mid-2018, for dementia caregivers with community-dwelling care-recipients. A new classification of interventions was proposed to enable a more detailed examination of the effectiveness of psychological interventions; 350 postintervention effect sizes in 128 studies and 155 follow-up effect sizes in 55 studies were computed. Postintervention effects were significant for all outcomes when all interventions are pooled together. Follow-up effects were found for all outcomes, except physical health and positive aspects of caregiving. Educational programs with psychotherapeutic components, counseling/psychotherapy, and mindfulness-based interventions had the strongest effects on reducing depressive symptoms. Multicomponent and miscellaneous interventions had the largest effects on reduction of burden/stress. Multicomponent and mindfulness-based interventions had the largest effects on enhancing subjective well-being. It should be noted that mindfulness and counseling/psychotherapy studies generally had small samples, and studies with smaller sample sizes tended to report larger effects. Metaregression analyses revealed that, overall, younger caregivers benefited more from the interventions. Although the majority of studies were from North America and Europe, there were a growing number from Asia and other parts of the world. Recommendations were made, including developing new theoretical models that address caregivers' changing needs over time; development of interventions that can be flexibly administered and individually "tailored," and assessing positive as well as negative aspects of caregiving to encourage development of greater resilience. We conclude with observations on the global health significance of improving the impact of psychosocial interventions on caregivers' lives.

TI  - Impact of mindfulness on football coaches: A mixed design.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mindfulness is an increasingly popular practice among elite athletes to improve performance and well-being, but its application for coaches is still very limited. Therefore, a new program (M*E; Mindfulness para Entrenadores) was designed and implemented online for 6 weeks for coaches, support staff, and technical directors. Participants were 58 (57 men), aged between 23 and 58 (M = 31.8). The between-subject analysis (RM ANOVA 2*2) included experimental (n = 26) and wait-list control group (n = 21). A total of 29 completed the within-subject analysis (RM ANOVA) completing follow-up measurements until six months. The analysis was complemented with 21 individual semi-structured interviews. The experimental group showed significant improvements in mindfulness trait (p < .001), interpersonal mindfulness (p = .010), and a significant improvement in emotional regulation (p = .010) in comparison to the wait-list control group. The experimental group's positive trend in all variables' levels was maintained until six months after the program. The qualitative analysis showed a positive impact on professional, personal, and social areas with improvements related to performance and well-being. Several participants considered the program as "fundamental" for their professional role. This study provides information on best practices in implementing mindfulness-based programs, highlighting their practical orientation, the training plan, and the safe space. These results offer initial validation of the potential of the M*E and invite sports organizations to incorporate mindfulness-based programs specially designed for coaches, support staff and technical directors.

M3  - Article
AB  - Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) have become an influential approach to foster teacher well-being; however, little research addresses the critiques and sustainability of PPIs. This study investigated teacher experiences of PPIs and the impact on their wellbeing in professional and personal contexts. Qualitative data were collected using multi-methods in a primary school in two settings: staff-meetings with 21 teachers and a self-interest group with 9 teachers. Results showed practising PPIs enhanced teachers' wellbeing multidimensionally and produced positive impacts on others. The challenges experienced and plans for sustainable actions were identified. Insights into sustainable teacher wellbeing programmes and professional development are offered.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Meditation-based mind-body therapies for negative symptoms of schizophrenia: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Meditation-based mind-body therapies (yoga, tai-chi, qi-gong, mindfulness) have been suggested to have a potential therapeutic effect on negative symptoms.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining effectiveness of yoga, tai-chi, qi-gong and mindfulness on negative symptoms of schizophrenia, using different databases and trial registries. The primary outcome was effect of mind-body therapies on negative symptoms and the secondary outcome was effect on positive symptoms.Fifteen RCTs were included in the meta-analysis (N= 1081 patients). Overall, we found a beneficial effect of mind-body interventions on negative symptoms at endpoint compared to treatment-as-usual or nonspecific control interventions, but the effect was small and moderate to high heterogeneity was present.A subgroup analysis for different types of therapy revealed a significant effect of mindfulness-based and yoga interventions on negative symptoms, but heterogeneity within the yoga subgroup was high. Our results did not show an increase of positive symptoms (N= 1051).Our results suggest a potential for meditation-based mind-body therapies in the treatment of negative symptoms, in particular for mindfulness based approaches and to a lesser extent yoga. Limitations in the available comparisons do not allow concluding on a specific effect of these interventions. Overall, the currently available evidence remains limited and does not yet allow one to recommend mind-body therapies for the reduction of negative symptoms. However, the present findings justify further research on mind-body therapies for the treatment of negative symptoms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mindful self-compassion for veteran women with a history of military sexual trauma: feasibility, acceptability, potential benefits, and considerations
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Military sexual trauma (MST) is reported by up to 74% of women veterans in the United States and is a driver of poor behavioural and physical health. Self-compassion is a transdiagnostic, protective factor linked with improved posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and health behaviours. Thus, Mindful Self-Compassion training (MSC) may help ameliorate MST-related impacts. However, MSC can also temporarily increase distress (i.e. backdraft). Delivering it with elective trauma-informed yoga (TIY), which regulates acute distress, may help address this issue.Objective: This VA quality improvement project examined feasibility, acceptability, and reported benefits and challenges of a manualized 8-week MSC including within non-randomized subgroups: MSC (n = 4) and MSC+ elective TIY classes (MSC+; n = 4).Methods: Nine women veterans with a history of MST at a Vet Center in the Northeastern U.S.A. enrolled; eight completed, excluding one MSC+ participant. Measures included attrition (n = 9), attendance (n = 8), weekly (n = 8) and posttreatment acceptability (n = 6), validated symptom severity assessments (n = 7), and an exit interview (n = 8).Results: Among completers, MSC attendance was excellent (89%) and higher among in MSC+ vs. MSC (94% vs. 84% sessions completed). On average across the two groups, depressive and PTSD symptom severity decreased by 21% and 30%, respectively. In exit interviews, participants across groups described improved coping with distress and psychiatric symptoms, reduced stress, and improved self-care and health behaviours. Although women in both groups reported backdraft during the programme, MSC+ also reported healthier coping and improved emotional processing.Conclusion: The results of this programme evaluation infer MSC may be feasible, acceptable, and beneficial for women survivors of MST in one Vet Center in the Northeastern USA. Further, temporary elevations in MSC-related distress may be ameliorated with adjunctive TIY. Given requests of women veterans in the USA. for additional complementary and integrative health treatment options, formal research on these approaches is warranted.This programme evaluation with women veterans with a history of military sexual trauma (MST) explored the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and reported benefits and challenges of a Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) programme, with or without trauma-informed yoga.Women across groups reported improved psychiatric symptoms, self-care, and health behaviours, although those in MSC+ yoga reported healthier coping and improved emotional processing.Results suggest MSC training may be feasible, acceptable, and potentially beneficial for women veterans with MST in one clinical setting in the Northeastern USA, with potential synergistic effects of adjunctive yoga.Antecedentes: Hasta el 74% de las mujeres veteranas de los Estados Unidos han sufrido traumas sexuales en el ejercito (MST, en sus siglas en ingles), lo que provoca una mala salud fisica y conductual. La autocompasion es un factor protector transdiagnostico relacionado con la mejora del trastorno de estres postraumatico (TEPT), la depresion y los comportamientos saludables. Asi pues, el entrenamiento en Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC, en sus siglas en ingles) puede ayudar a mejorar los efectos relacionados con el MST. Sin embargo, el MSC tambien puede aumentar temporalmente la perturbacion (es decir, el retroceso). Si se combina con el yoga informada en trauma (TIY, en sus siglas en ingles), que regula la angustia aguda, puede ayudar a resolver este problema.Objetivo: Este proyecto de mejora de la calidad de VA examino la viabilidad, la aceptabilidad y los beneficios y desafios reportados de un MSC manualizado de 8 semanas incluyendo dentro de subgrupos no aleatorizados: MSC (n = 4) y MSC+ clases selectivas de TIY (MSC+; n = 4).Metodos: Se inscribieron nueve mujeres veteranas con antecedentes de MST en un centro de veteranos del noreste de EE.UU.; ocho completaron el programa, excluida una participante MSC+. Las medidas incluyeron desercion (n = 9), asistencia (n = 8), aceptabilidad semanal (n = 8) y posterior al tratamiento (n = 6), evaluaciones validadas de la gravedad de los sintomas (n = 7) y una entrevista de salida (n = 8).Resultados: Entre los participantes, la asistencia al MSC fue excelente (89%) y mayor en el MSC+ que en el MSC (94% frente a 84% de sesiones completadas). En promedio, en los dos grupos, la gravedad de los sintomas depresivos y de TEPT disminuyo un 21% y un 30%, respectivamente. En las entrevistas de salida, las participantes de todos los grupos describieron una mejora en el afrontamiento de la perturbacion y los sintomas psiquiatricos, una reduccion del estres y una mejora en las conductas de autocuidado y salud. Aunque las mujeres de ambos grupos informaron de un retroceso durante el programa, MSC+ tambien informo de un afrontamiento mas saludable y una mejora en el procesamiento emocional.Conclusiones: Los resultados de esta evaluacion del programa infieren que el MSC puede ser factible, aceptable y beneficioso para las mujeres sobrevivientes de MST en un Centro de Veteranos en el noreste de EE.UU. Ademas, las elevaciones temporales en la angustia relacionada con el MSC pueden mejorarse con TIY complementario. Dadas las necesidades de las mujeres veteranas en EE.UU. de opciones adicionales de tratamiento complementario e integrador de la salud, se justifica la investigacion formal de estos enfoques.

TI  - What Makes Mindfulness-Based Interventions Effective? An Examination of Common Components
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Mindfulness-based approaches to meditation usually rely on not one but several specific techniques or elements, but what elements are responsible for which of the commonly found positive effects is not yet known. To help answer this question, we compared the effects of three different meditation techniques that are commonly used in mindfulness-based approaches. Methods Fifty-six students with no prior meditation experience participated in a breathing, body scan, or loving-kindness meditation condition. Participants followed meditation instructions that they were given on audio files, for daily practice and weekly meetings over a period of 6 weeks. Dependent variables were mindfulness, concentration, self-compassion, emotional regulation and experience, and life satisfaction. Results The body scan meditation condition reported greater effects on almost all dependent variables than those in the breathing meditation condition with effect sizes from beta = .16 to .61. The group showed the highest increase in the mindfulness dimension acceptance but not presence. Loving-kindness meditation showed higher effect sizes in concentration than the breathing meditation group. Conclusions Specific meditation techniques may have effects other than expected on psychological variables. Considering the limitations of this study, further research is needed to assess the specific effects of single mindfulness techniques.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Associations between Amount of Meditation Practice and Outcomes in Interventions Using the Four Immeasurables Meditations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Interventions using the "Four Immeasurables Meditations" (FIM) are effective for various outcomes; however, whether increased meditation practice in these interventions leads to better results has not been well investigated. This systematic review included 22 FIM interventions that reported associations between the amount of meditation practice and its outcomes. Despite the heterogeneity in intervention components and outcome variables, there were generally few significant associations between amount of meditation practice and its outcomes. Specifically, only five studies reported that more than half of the calculated results were significant. In comparison with correlations between total amount of practice and overall outcomes, the short-term influence of meditation practice was evaluated in fewer studies; however, it had a better association with outcomes. More studies are required that address the underlying mechanisms that elucidate how meditation practice leads to outcome changes in daily life. In this study, two promising mechanisms with initial evidence were discussed. This review also summarized common methodological issues including a lack of experimental manipulation and inaccurate measuring of meditation practice.

TI  - A Single-Session, 2-Hour Version of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (One MORE) Improves Chronic Pain Patients' Pain-Related Outcomes Through 3-Month Follow-Up in a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Traditional, 8-week, mindfulness-based interventions can effectively treat chronic pain, but require a time and resource investment too burdensome for many patients and providers. The solution to this logistical challenge may be to distill the core, therapeutic elements of an efficacious 8-week, mindfulness-based intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), into a 2-h, single-session intervention. Methods: In this study, the authors conducted a waitlist-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the impact of a 2-h, single-session adaptation of MORE (i.e., One MORE) on chronic pain patients' (N = 40) pain-related outcomes through 3-month follow-up. Results: Results indicated that One MORE significantly improved chronic pain patients' pain catastrophizing (i.e., primary outcome; F = 9.97, p = 0.002), pain intensity (F = 26.58, p < 0.001), pain interference (F = 39.43, p < 0.001), physical function (F = 16.29, p < 0.001), sleep (F = 16.66, p < 0.001), anxiety (F = 12.54, p < 0.001), and depression (F = 17.48, p < 0.001). One MORE also significantly increased theoretically indicated therapeutic mechanisms through the 3-month follow-up: mindfulness, positive reappraisal, savoring, self-transcendence. Discussion: Study results are promising, and if replicated, would suggest that One MORE is a highly scalable, low-cost (e.g., sustainable), nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic pain. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05194241.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress symptoms in palliative care professionals seeking mindfulness training: Prevalence and vulnerability
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vicarious exposure to trauma is ubiquitous in palliative medicine. Repeated exposure to trauma may contribute to compassion fatigue and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in medical and supportive care professionals such as physicians, nurses, and social workers. These symptoms may be intensified among medical and supportive care professionals who use avoidant or rigid coping strategies.Aim: This study aimed to provide an estimate of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in a sample of professionals who work in palliative care settings, and have already been enrolled in mindfulness-based communication training.Design: Palliative care providers provided self-reported ratings of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression, and coping strategies using validated measures including the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version.Setting/participants: A total of 21 professionals working with palliative care patients completed assessments prior to beginning mindfulness-based communication training.Results: Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were prevalent in this sample of professionals; 42% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and 33% indicated probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis.Conclusion: Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms may be common among professionals working in palliative medicine. Professionals prone to avoidant coping and those with more rigid negative thought processes may be at higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

TI  - Therapeutic psychological and biological responses to mindfulness-based art therapy
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Stress and anxiety pose a threat to college students' academic performance as well as their long-term mental and physical health, but the time constraints of a rigorous academic schedule make it difficult to offer even brief mental health interventions. A convenience sample of full-time students at a public university was recruited for a 5-week study conducted mostly using an online platform. Participants were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT) intervention or a Neutral Clay Task (NCT). Anxiety, perceived stress, and salivary cortisol outcomes were measured. A total ofn= 77 participants completed the study. The MBAT group experienced significant reductions in anxiety and perceived stress compared to the NCT group. Significant reductions in salivary cortisol were observed, but only time could be identified as a confounding variable. Art making alone is not enough to induce significant positive responses, but this study suggests MBAT can, and that an online intervention could offer feasible and accessible mental health services on college campuses. Further refinement of biological data collection and analysis is needed to determine what the mediating effects MBAT could have, if any, at the molecular level.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Older Adults: Effects on Executive Function, Frontal Alpha Asymmetry and Immune Function
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aims: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has enhanced cognition, positive emotion, and immunity in younger and middle-aged samples; its benefits are less well known for older persons. Here we report on a randomized controlled trial of MBSR for older adults and its effects on executive function, left frontal asymmetry of the EEG alpha band, and antibody response. Methods: Older adults (n = 201) were randomized to MBSR or waiting list control. The outcome measures were: the Trail Making Test part B/A (Trails B/A) ratio, a measure of executive function; changes in left frontal alpha asymmetry, an indicator of positive emotions or approach motivation; depression, mindfulness, and perceived stress scores, and the immunoglobulin G response to a protein antigen, a measure of adaptive immunity. Results: MBSR participants had a lower Trails B/A ratio immediately after intervention (p < 0.05); reduced shift to rightward frontal alpha activation after intervention (p = 0.03); higher baseline antibody levels after intervention (p < 0.01), but lower antibody responses 24 weeks after antigen challenge (p < 0.04), and improved mindfulness after intervention (p = 0.023) and at 21 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.006). Conclusions: MBSR produced small but significant changes in executive function, mindfulness, and sustained left frontal alpha asymmetry. The antibody findings at follow-up were unexpected. Further study of the effects of MBSR on immune function should assess changes in antibody responses in comparison to T-cell-mediated effector functions, which decline as a function of age.

TI  - The Impacts of Background Music on the Effects of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Positive Emotions
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has been widely used in promoting mental health, with positive emotions as an important mechanism. The current study explored the impact of background music on the effects and difficulties of LKM practice. Two hundred participants were randomly divided into six groups, wherein LKM plus music with harmony only, LKM plus music with harmony and melody, and LKM without music were presented in a different order during the intermediate three days of a five-day LKM intervention. Participants reported three types of positive emotions (pro-social, low-arousal, and medium-arousal positive emotions) and the difficulties during meditation (lack of concentration and lack of pro-social attitudes) after each of three sessions. The results of MANOVA indicated that compared to the session without music, incorporating music could evoke more low-arousal positive emotions and pro-social positive emotions without altering the difficulties. However, the results did not reveal significant differences in the effects of music with harmony and music with harmony and melody on both emotions and difficulties. Additionally, practice effects may have influenced the generation of medium-arousal positive emotions and the difficulty of concentration, but the results were inconsistent across groups. Our findings suggest potential benefits for practitioners of LKM in incorporating music during the meditation process, and the directions for future research were further discussed.

TI  - Yoga and Emotion Regulation in High School Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Middle adolescents (15-17 years old) are prone to increased risk taking and emotional instability. Emotion dysregulation contributes to a variety of psychosocial difficulties in this population. A discipline such as yoga offered during school may increase emotion regulation, but research in this area is lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a yoga intervention on the emotion regulation of high school students as compared to physical education (PE). In addition, the potential mediating effects of mindful attention, self-compassion, and body awareness on the relationship between yoga and emotion regulation were examined. High school students were randomized to participate in a 16-week yoga intervention (n = 19) or regular PE (n = 18). Pre-post data analyses revealed that emotion regulation increased significantly in the yoga group as compared to the PE group (F(1,32) = 7.50, p = .01, and eta(2) = .19). No significant relationship was discovered between the changes in emotion regulation and the proposed mediating variables. Preliminary results suggest that yoga increases emotion regulation capacities of middle adolescents and provides benefits beyond that of PE alone.

TI  - Enhancing social functioning in young people at Ultra High Risk (UHR) for psychosis: A pilot study of a novel strengths and mindfulness-based online social therapy
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Psychological and pharmacological treatments have been shown to reduce rates of transition to psychosis in Ultra High Risk (UHR) young people. However, social functioning deficits have been unresponsive to current treatments.Aims: The study aims were to: i) describe the theoretical basis and therapeutic targets of a novel intervention targeting social functioning in UHR young people; and ii) examine its acceptability, safety and preliminary effect on social functioning.Methods: An international, multidisciplinary team developed a new intervention (MOMENTUM) to improve social functioning in UHR young people. MOMENTUM blends two novel approaches to social recovery: strengths and mindfulness-based intervention embedded within a social media environment, and application of the self-determination theory of motivation. The acceptability and safety of MOMENTUM were tested through a 2-month pilot study with 14 UHR participants.Results: System usage was high, with over 70% of users being actively engaged over the trial. All participants reported a positive experience using MOMENTUM, considered it safe and would recommend it to others. 93% reported it to be helpful. There were large, reliable improvements in social functioning (d = 1.83. p < 0.001) and subjective wellbeing (d = 0.75, p = 0.03) at follow-up. There were significant increases in the mechanisms targeted by the intervention including strengths usage (d = 0.70, p = 0.03), mindfulness skills (d = 0.66, p = 0.04) and components of social support. Social functioning improvement was significantly correlated with indicators of system usage.Conclusion: MOMENTUM is engaging and safe. MOMENTUM appeared to engage the hypothesized mechanisms and showed promise as a new avenue to improve social functioning in UHR young people. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sleep effects of psychological therapies for menopausal symptoms in women with hot flashes and night sweats: A systematic review.
T2  - Post reproductive health
M3  - Systematic Review
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Sleep disturbance is frequently reported by women during the menopausal transition due to various physiological changes and environmental factors. Insomnia is a critical treatment target for its deleterious effects on daytime functioning and quality of life and increased risk of developing a depressive disorder. Due to medication side effects and patient preferences, there is increased interest in the use of psychological treatments that address the myriad of menopausal symptoms, including cognitive-behavioural therapy, clinical hypnosis and mindfulness-based therapies. The objective of this article is to review the effects of psychological treatments for menopausal symptoms on sleep disturbance in peri-/postmenopausal women. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed and reference lists from inception until May 2023, including 12 studies that evaluated sleep as a secondary outcome. Most studies found that group and self-help (guided and unguided) cognitive-behavioural therapies and clinical hypnosis for menopausal symptoms have positive effects on sleep among women with significant vasomotor symptoms. There was preliminary support for mindfulness-based stress reduction. Future research including more diverse samples and women with sleep disorders is needed. Evaluating the implementation of psychological therapies in clinics where menopausal women seek care is an important next step.

TI  - Empirically supported psychological treatments: The challenges of comorbid psychiatric and behavioral disorders in people with intellectual disability
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on psychological interventions with empirical evidence of efficacy in treating common psychiatric and behavioral disorders in people with intellectual disability (ID) at all stages of their life. We begin with a brief presentation of what is meant by psychiatric and behavioral disorders in this population, along with an explanation of some of the factors that contribute to the increased psychosocial vulnerability of this group to present with these problems. We then conduct a review of empirically supported psychological therapies used to treat psychiatric and behavioral disorders in people with ID. The review is structured around the three generations of therapies: Applied behavior analysis (e.g., positive behavior support), cognitive behavioral therapies (e.g., mindfulness-based cognitive therapy), and contextual therapies (e.g., dialectical behavior therapy). We conclude with some recommendations for professional practice in the fields of ID and psychiatry.

TI  - Effects of a online brief modified mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy for anxiety among Chinese adults: A randomized clinical trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated anxiety and related symptoms among the general population. In order to cope with the mental health burden, we developed an online brief modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (mMBSR) therapy. We performed a parallel-group randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the mMBSR for adult anxiety with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as an active control. Participants were ran-domized to mMBSR, CBT or waitlist group. Those in the intervention arms performed each therapy for 6 sections in 3 weeks. Measurements were conducted at baseline, post-treatment and 6 months post-treatment by Gener-alized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, reverse scored Cohen Perceived Stress scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. 150 participants with anxiety symptoms were randomized to mMBSR, CBT or waitlist group. Post intervention assessments showed that mMBSR improved the scores of all the six mental problem dimensions (anxiety, depression, so-matization, stress, insomnia, and the experience of pleasure) significantly compared to the waitlist group. During 6-month post treatment assessment, the scores of all six mental problem dimensions in the mMBSR group still showed improvement compared to baseline and showed no significant difference with the CBT group. Our results provide positive evidence for the efficacy and feasibility of an online brief modified MBSR program to alleviate anxiety and related symptoms of individuals from the general population, and the therapeutic benefits of mMBSR persisted for up to six months. This low resource-consuming intervention could facilitate the challenges of supplying psychological health therapy to large scale of population.

TI  - Decentering the Self? Reduced Bias in Self- vs. Other-Related Processing in Long-Term Practitioners of Loving-Kindness Meditation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research in social neuroscience provides increasing evidence that self and other are interconnected, both on a conceptual and on an affective representational level. Moreover, the ability to recognize the other as "like the self" is thought to be essential for social phenomena like empathy and compassion. Meditation practices such as loving kindness meditation (LKM) have been found to enhance these capacities. Therefore, we investigated whether LKM is associated to an increased integration of self other-representations. As an indicator, we assessed the P300 event-related potential elicited by oddball stimuli of the self-face and a close other's face in 12 long-term practitioners of LKM and 12 matched controls. In line with previous studies, the self elicited larger P300 amplitudes than close other. This effect was reduced in the meditation sample at parietal but not frontal midline sites. Within this group, smaller differences between self- and other-related P300 were associated with increasing meditation practice. Across groups, smaller P300 differences correlated with self-reported compassion. In meditators, we also investigated the effect of a short LKM compared to a control priming procedure in order to test whether the state induction would additionally modulate self- vs. other related P300. However, no effect of the priming conditions was observed. Overall, our findings provide preliminary evidence that prolonged meditation practice may modulate self- vs. other-related processing, accompanied by an increase in compassion. Further evidence is needed, however, to show if this is a direct outcome of loving-kindness meditation.

TI  - Compassion Meditation for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Veterans: A Randomized Proof of Concept Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is considerable interest in developing complementary and integrative approaches for ameliorating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compassion meditation (CM) and loving-kindness meditation appear to offer benefits to individuals with PTSD, including symptom reduction. The present study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of CM for PTSD in veterans. The CM condition, an adaptation of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT (R)), consists of exercises to stabilize attention, develop present-moment awareness, and foster compassion. We compared CM to Veteran.calm (VC), which consists of psychoeducation about PTSD, rationale for relaxation, relaxation training, and sleep hygiene. Both conditions consist of 10 weekly 90-min group sessions with between-session practice assignments. A total of 28 veterans attended at least one session of the group intervention and completed pre- and posttreatment measures of PTSD severity and secondary outcomes as well as weekly measures of PTSD, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative emotions. Measures of treatment credibility, attendance, practice compliance, and satisfaction were administered to assess feasibility. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a more substantive reduction in PTSD symptoms in the CM condition than in the VC condition, between-group d = -0.85. Credibility, attendance, and satisfaction were similar across CM and VC conditions thus demonstrating the feasibility of CM and the appropriateness of VC as a comparison condition. The findings of this initial randomized pilot study provide rationale for future studies examining the efficacy and effectiveness of CM for veterans with PTSD.

TI  - Focused attention, open monitoring and loving kindness meditation: effects on attention, conflict monitoring, and creativity - A review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Meditation is becoming increasingly popular as a topic for scientific research and theories on meditation are becoming ever more specific. We distinguish between what is called focused Attention meditation, open Monitoring meditation, and loving kindness (or compassion) meditation. Research suggests that these meditations have differential, dissociable effects on a wide range of cognitive (control) processes, such as attentional selection, conflict monitoring, divergent, and convergent thinking. Although research on exactly how the various meditations operate on these processes is still missing, different kinds of meditations are associated with different neural structures and different patterns of electroencephalographic activity. In this review we discuss recent findings on meditation and suggest how the different meditations may affect cognitive processes, and we give suggestions for directions of future research.

TI  - Meditation Quality Matters: Effects of Loving-Kindness and Compassion Meditations on Subjective Well-being are Associated with Meditation Quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LKCM) are considered a promising practice for increasing long-term well-being. While previous studies have mainly focused on meditation practice quantity, the current study provides an initial exploration of the quality of meditation during multiweek LKCM training. Data were collected through offline (Study 1; N = 41) and online (Study 2; N = 243) LKCM interventions. Quality of meditation was measured using two kinds of difficulties experienced during LKCM each week/unit (i.e., difficulty in concentration and difficulty in generating prosocial attitudes). Subjective well-being (SWB) was assessed by life satisfaction before and after training as well as positive and negative emotions each week/unit. Two studies consistently suggested that meditation quality was significantly associated with changes in SWB. Study 1 even showed that quality had a stronger association with SWB than did meditation quantity. Moreover, both short-term (measured each week/unit) and long-term (measured across the entire training period) associations between the quality of meditation and SWB were significant. Focusing on meditation quality, our findings provide theoretical and methodological pathways for understanding the contribution of meditation practice to LKCM training, which is helpful for guiding future research and best practices.

TI  - Peer navigation-delivered loving kindness meditation: A pilot project
T2  - COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peer navigators (PNs), including trained cancer survivor volunteers, can be an important resource to the cancer care team in reducing barriers to screening, treatment, and psychosocial care among underserved communities through their roles in outreach, education, advocacy, and peer support. As cancer centers face growing patient demand and evidence for integrating complementary therapies into conventional care, opportunities to envision new roles for PN arise. Based on psychosocial assessments conducted at an academic cancer center serving the low-income population of Bronx, NY, we found strong interest in both providing (44 %) and receiving (76 %) peer support, as well as in (76 %) mind-body practices (e.g., meditation). In research, these mind-body modalities and peer support have both been found to improve many aspects of physical and emotional outcomes in cancer patients, but none has looked at PNs as a potential resource for delivering such mind-body interventions. Towards this end, we conducted two pilot studies to train PN from an onsite peer navigation program called the BOLD Buddy Program, to deliver a well-defined, easy to learn, and culturally-aligned mind-body practice, i.e., Loving Kindness (LK) Meditation, to each other and to patients. Incorporating comparison to professional meditation instructors, our pilot work demonstrated that peer-lead LKM was associated with benefits to emotional well-being, relaxation, satisfaction, and perceived usability and that PNs were equally well-received in delivering LK as their professional counterparts. Evaluating 8 domains of feasibility using standardized measures, we were able to demonstrate that peer-lead LK was: in demand, acceptable, implementable, practical, adaptable, adoptable, expandable, and promising in efficacy.

TI  - Rationale and design of a multisite randomized clinical trial examining an integrated behavioral treatment for veterans with co-occurring chronic pain and opioid use disorder: The pain and opioids integrated treatment in veterans (POSITIVE) trial
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) individually represent a risk to health and well-being. Concerningly, there is evidence that they are frequently co-morbid. While few treatments exist that simultaneously target both conditions, preliminary work has supported the feasibility of an integrated behavioral treatment targeting pain interference and opioid misuse. This treatment combined Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (ACT+MBRP). This paper describes the protocol for the adequately powered efficacy study of this integrated treatment. Methods: A multisite randomized controlled trial will examine the efficacy of ACT+MBRP in comparison to a parallel education control condition, focusing on opioid safety and pain education. Participants include veterans (n = 160; 21-75 years old) recruited from three Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare Systems with chronic pain who are on a stable dose of buprenorphine. Both conditions include twelve weekly 90 min group sessions delivered via telehealth. Primary outcomes include pain interference (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System - Pain Interference) and hazardous opioid use (Current Opioid Misuse Measure), which will be examined at the end of the active treatment phase and through 12 months post-intervention. Secondary analyses will evaluate outcomes including pain intensity, depression, pain-related fear, and substance use, as well as treatment mechanisms. Conclusion: This study will determine the efficacy of an integrated behavioral treatment program for pain interference and hazardous opioid use among veterans with chronic pain and OUD who are prescribed buprenorphine, addressing a critical need for more integrated treatments for chronic pain and OUD.

TI  - Positive psychology interventions in breast cancer. A systematic review
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectivePositive psychology is an emerging area of empirical study, not only in clinical, but also in health psychology. The present systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence about the positive psychology interventions utilized in breast cancer.MethodsRelevant studies were identified via Pubmed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL, Wiley Online Library, TDX, and DIALNET databases (up to April 2013). Only those papers focused on interventions related to positive psychology and carried out on breast cancer patients were included.ResultsOf the 7266 articles found through databases, 16 studies were finally included in this review. Five groups of therapies were found: mindfulness-based approaches, expression of positive emotions, spiritual interventions, hope therapy, and meaning-making interventions. These specific interventions promoted positive changes in breast cancer participants, such as enhanced quality of life, well-being, hope, benefit finding, or optimism. However, the disparity of the interventions and some methodological issues limit the outcomes.ConclusionsSome studies provided relevant evidence about the clear development of positive aspects from the breast cancer experience. Positive interventions applied to patients and survivors of breast cancer were found to be able to promote positive aspects. A global consensus of a positive therapies classification is needed to take one more step in structuring positive psychology. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Dissociating meditation proficiency and experience dependent EEG changes during traditional Vipassana meditation practice
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation, as taught by most schools of practice, consists of a set of heterogeneous techniques. We wanted to assess if EEG profiles varied across different meditation techniques, proficiency levels and experience of the practitioners. We examined EEG dynamics in Vipassana meditators (Novice, Senior meditators and Teachers) while they engaged in their traditional meditation practice (concentration, mindfulness and loving kindness in a structured manner) as taught by S.N. Goenka.Seniors and Teachers (vs Novices) showed trait increases in delta (1-4 Hz), theta-alpha (6-10 Hz) and low-gamma power (30-40 Hz) at baseline rest; state-trait increases in low-alpha (8-10 Hz) and low-gamma power during concentrative and mindfulness meditation; and theta-alpha and low-gamma power during loving-kindness meditation. Permutation entropy and Higuchi fractal dimension measures further dissociated high proficiency from duration of experience as only Teachers showed consistent increase in network complexity from baseline rest and state transitions between the different meditation states.

TI  - Boosting prosocial career aspirations: Loving-kindness meditation relates to higher communal career goals in youth
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wanting to help others and benefit society in one's future career are examples of communal career goals. Raising these goals in youth should increase interest in HEED-occupations (Healthcare, Early Education, Domestic, and the Domestic fields) which are strongly gender-skewed and face labor shortage. Research has yet to find ways to increase communal career goals. In this study, we test the novel hypothesis that after listening to a brief loving-kindness meditation, participants will rate stronger communal career goals, as compared to controls. In three experimental studies, volunteering high-school students (Study 1 and 3) and university students (Study 2) listened to a 12-min recording of the meditation with the explicit purpose of investigating its effect on stress. They thereafter filled out an apparently unrelated career goal survey. We compared the results with a control group that just rated the career goals (Studies 1-3) and a control group that listened to calm music before filling out the survey (Study 2 and 3). The results showed that the high-school students rated higher communal career goals after listening to the meditation, as compared to controls. We did not replicate the result in the sample of university students, which could relate to adults having less flexible career goals than youth, or to a ceiling effect in communal goals. This is the first study that has demonstrated a method with the potential of increasing communal career goals in youth. In addition to increasing interest in HEED, raising communal goals could benefit society, since they are intrinsically prosocial.

AB  - This narrative case study is an exploration of Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), an emerging mindfulness-based approach, and its impact on university students' professional identities. MBB was used as content and an intervention tool in a psychology course. The study provides an in-depth analysis of two students' narratives to illustrate and discuss the usefulness of MBB in the university setting. The findings demonstrate that MBB helped students develop their professional identity with regard to self-confidence, self-awareness, social relationships, and professional future. Moreover, the link between the development of students' professional identities and their abilities to cope with work-related stress is found.

TI  - Changes in Mindfulness and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Veterans Enrolled in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The current study assessed associations between changes in 5 facets of mindfulness (Acting With Awareness, Observing, Describing, Non-Reactivity, and Nonjudgment) and changes in 4 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters (Re-Experiencing, Avoidance, Emotional Numbing, and Hyperarousal symptoms) among veterans participating in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Method: Secondary analyses were performed with a combined data set consisting of 2 published and 2 unpublished trials of MBSR conducted at a large Veterans Affairs hospital. The combined sample included 113 veterans enrolled in MBSR who screened positive for PTSD and completed measures of mindfulness and PTSD symptoms before and after the 8-week intervention. Results: Increases in mindfulness were significantly associated with reduced PTSD symptoms. Increases in Acting With Awareness and Non-Reactivity were the facets of mindfulness most strongly and consistently associated with reduced PTSD symptoms. Increases in mindfulness were most strongly related to decreases in Hyperarousal and Emotional Numbing. Conclusions: These results extend previous research, provide preliminary support for changes in mindfulness as a viable mechanism of treatment, and have a number of potential practical and theoretical implications.

TI  - Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma: In-Person and Online Delivery of an Intervention to Promote Mental Health Among Latina Immigrant Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A few mindfulness-based interventions have been developed for Latina immigrant populations. We describe the feasibility and acceptability of Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA), a culturally grounded intervention developed to prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Latina immigrants. We also compare participation in the intervention in-person with an online adaptation developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: ALMA was developed through several years of formative research in collaboration with community organizations serving Latino immigrants. The curriculum integrates mindfulness-based approaches with Latino cultural strengths to reduce stress, enhance coping strategies, and increase social support. Latina immigrant women who spoke Spanish were recruited from Latino serving organizations to participate in an intervention trial. The program consisted of eight sessions offered weekly in person to groups of similar to 20 Latina immigrants. After the onset of the pandemic, the program was adapted to be delivered online via zoom. Attendance and fidelity were monitored by intervention staff, and a satisfaction survey was given to participants post-intervention.Results: We enrolled 226 Latina immigrant women with an average age of 40 years and an average of 15.0 years living in the United States. The majority of participants were monolingual Spanish speakers (59%) with a high school degree (66%), although almost half were living on less than $2,200 per month (48%). One hundred and seven (47%) attended the program in-person, and 119 (53%) participated online. Program attendance was similar across modalities, with an average of 58% sessions completed among in-person and 60% among online participants. Participant satisfaction and perceived efficacy of the intervention were high in both in-person and online groups.Discussion: Our findings indicate that the ALMA intervention is acceptable and feasible in this population. Future research should assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in Latina immigrant populations, including both in-person and online modalities.CTR# NCT03749278.

TI  - Effects of a 12-Week Mindfulness, Compassion, and Loving Kindness Program on Chronic Depression: A Pilot Within-Subjects Wait-List Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this pilot study, N = 11 patients suffering from chronic depression were treated in a 12-week group program consisting of basic mindfulness exercises from Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and compassion exercises from Compassion Focused Therapy and Loving Kindness Meditation. In a 3-month waiting period prior to treatment, depression symptoms both in self-report and clinician rating did not change significantly. After treatment, depression severity was significantly reduced. After a 3-month follow-up, the symptoms further improved, with almost large effect sizes being observed in primary outcome measures.Changes in emotion regulation styles reflected by a significant increase in acceptance and significant decrease in suppression of emotions were observed at follow-up. Rumination about oneself was also significantly reduced at follow-up. Compassionate love and mindfulness were increased at follow-up, no effects were found on the Self-Compassion Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Given further confirming studies for this approach, it might improve treatment options for patients suffering from chronic depression.

TI  - Differential effects of mindful breathing and loving kindness meditations: a component analysis study
T2  - ADVANCES IN MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveMindful breathing meditation (MBM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) are common components of effective mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). This study examined the differential effects of MBM and LKM on purported therapeutic process variables and mental health outcomes via component analysis.MethodThe research design was a randomized controlled trial with four conditions: MBM, LKM, combined (MBM + LKM), and a relaxation control. All conditions consisted of 10-min. audio-recorded guided meditations that were self-implemented over the course of two weeks. Participants were college undergraduates (N = 52).ResultsFindings indicated statistically significant and very large main effects of time, regardless of condition. Statistically significant time by condition interactions were only observed for one process variable (i.e., defusion) and one mental health outcome (i.e., depression). Follow-up descriptive evaluation of between-group effect sizes indicated patterns of favorable effects for MBM and LKM over the combined and relaxation control conditions. Treatment integrity and treatment acceptability data indicated very favorable social validity across conditions.DiscussionWe conclude that our findings make a modest yet value-added contribution to the MBI component analysis literature, suggesting differentiated performance among isolated MBM and LKM exercises compared to combined and control conditions. Yet further research is warranted to improve upon the limitations of this study.

TI  - A Randomized Micro-Trial of a Loving-Kindness Meditation for Young Adults Living at Home with their Parents
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing number of young adults living at home with their parents, and this can lead to tension and conflict in the family home. One way to help increase the pro-social interactions and connectedness between young adults and their parents is with using Loving-Kindness Meditations (LKM). There is considerable evidence suggesting that LKM, which is a cultivation of good-will for self and others, can have many direct benefits on psychological distress and interpersonal interactions, and can indirectly increase self-compassion. This study examined the effects of using a 15-min Loving-Kindness Meditation for young adults living. A total of 97 participants (79 female, mean age = 18.64 years), were randomly allocated to LKM or a Focused Imagery control. Participants completed measures examining self-compassion, compassion motivation, and emotional, cognitive and interpersonal responses to vignettes describing conflict between young adults and their parents. As predicted, compared to controls, young adults who received LKM were higher in motivation to be self-compassionate, however, there was no difference in levels of self-compassion. Initial fear of self-compassion influenced emotional responses on the vignettes. The findings suggest that self-compassion could assist young adults in managing their own internal distress when interacting with their parents.

TI  - Feasibility of a Telephone-Delivered Group Meditation Intervention for Chronically Ill Socially Isolated Older Adults
T2  - CLINICAL GERONTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectivesThis pilot study assessed the feasibility of a group-based telephone-delivered meditation intervention to reduce social isolation in older adults. It included weekly training sessions and daily practices of loving-kindness meditation in small groups via telephone conferences for six weeks and an extended group meditation practice for another six weeks.MethodsCommunity-living older adults (age 60+) with multiple chronic conditions and experiencing social isolation were recruited. Each participant was assessed at the pretest, posttest, and follow-up (6 and 12 weeks after pretest). Outcome measures included social interaction, loneliness, and depressive symptoms. Open-ended questions were asked in the posttest and follow-up.ResultsSixteen individuals enrolled, and fourteen completed the program (87.5% retention). Completers showed high levels of adherence (95% attendance to training) and acceptability and a statistically significant increase in social interaction at follow-up. Qualitative data suggest that participants experienced changes in emotion regulation, motivation and confidence, and sense of belonging.ConclusionsA group-based telephone-delivered meditation intervention targeting chronically ill older adults who experience social isolation is technically feasible, very acceptable, and potentially beneficial to them.Clinical ImplicationsOlder adults enjoy learning meditation. Telephone conferencing is a low-cost tool for engaging socially isolated older adults in social interactions and group meditation.

TI  - Powered by compassion: The effect of loving-kindness meditation on entrepreneurs' sustainable decision -making
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - As environmental degradation and climate change continue to threaten our livelihood, entrepreneurs have a crucial role to play in promoting environmental regeneration and infusing their ventures with sustainable decision-making. Building on advances in research on social and sustainable entrepreneurship, we propose that compassion is an important predictor of entrepreneurial decisions involving an ethical balancing act between concerns for environmental and economic sustainability. We further draw on emerging evidence in psychology, pointing to meditative practice as a powerful and accessible source of compassion. In two experimental studies, we test and find support for a mediation model predicting that, compared to an active control group, entrepreneurs engaging in a brief Loving-Kindness Meditation report an increase in compassion and, in turn, higher sustainable decision-making. On the basis of these findings, we offer contributions to research on the psychological drivers of sustainable entrepreneurship and to the literature about meditation and compassion in entrepreneurship.

TI  - Experiences of Postpartum Women after Mindfulness Childbirth Classes: A Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe postpartum period can be a challenging experience for many women as they adjust to the physical and social changes after childbirth. Mindfulness-based interventions have been developed for stress reduction in a variety of health contexts, including pregnancy. These interventions provide strategies that may help new mothers handle the physical, emotional, and relationship challenges of the postpartum period and increase acceptance of postpartum physical changes and body image. Limited research has explored whether women use skills learned in prenatal mindfulness classes for the postpartum experience and parenting. The purpose of this study was to explore women's experience with mindfulness in the year after childbirth.MethodsTwelve women who participated in a Mindfulness for Childbirth and Parenting course during pregnancy were interviewed between 2 and 16 months postpartum. The semistructured interview guide included questions on how participants may have used mindfulness to approach a variety of positive and negative postpartum experiences. Qualitative description methodology guided the research team to code the transcripts independently. The team met to review and achieve consensus in the development of codes, categories, and themes from the data.ResultsFour themes were identified in women's postpartum experiences: 1) developing a new relationship with postpartum challenges, 2) formal practices of mindfulness to address postpartum challenges, 3) informal practices to address postpartum challenges, and 4) life-changing and transformative experiences. These themes showed a pathway by which participants used mindfulness skills to address postpartum challenges and to transform these challenges with a positive perspective.DiscussionMindfulness skills helped class participants cope with physical and emotional challenges postpartum and fostered positive meaningful relationships with partners and newborns. Findings have implications for future research on mindfulness-based interventions and the postpartum experience.

TI  - Mindfulness Predicts Lower Affective Volatility Among African Americans During Smoking Cessation
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research suggests that mindfulness benefits emotion regulation and smoking cessation. However, the mechanisms by which mindfulness affects emotional and behavioral functioning are unclear. One potential mechanism, lower affective volatility, has not been empirically tested during smoking cessation. This study examined longitudinal associations among mindfulness and emotional responding over the course of smoking cessation treatment among predominantly low-socioeconomic status (SES) African American smokers, who are at high risk for relapse to smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Participants (N = 399, 51% female, mean age = 42, 48% with annual income <$ 10,000) completed a baseline measure of trait mindfulness. Negative affect, positive affect, and depressive symptoms were assessed at five time points during smoking cessation treatment (up to 31 days postquit). Volatility indices were calculated to quantify within-person instability of emotional symptoms over time. Over and above demographic characteristics, nicotine dependence, and abstinence status, greater baseline trait mindfulness predicted lower volatility of negative affect and depressive symptoms surrounding the quit attempt and up to 1 month postquit, ps < 0.05. Although volatility did not mediate the association between greater mindfulness and smoking cessation, these results are the first to show that mindfulness is linked to lower affective volatility (or greater stability) of negative emotions during the course of smoking cessation. The present study suggests that mindfulness is linked to greater emotional stability and augments the study of mindfulness in diverse populations. Future studies should examine the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on volatility and whether lower volatility explains effects of mindfulness-based treatments on smoking cessation.

TI  - A pilot study of mindfulness-based stress reduction for hot flashes
T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A variety of results from both population and laboratory studies suggest that stress and hot flashes (HFs) are correlated and that HFs are more severe in women with lower coping abilities. The objective of this pilot study was to obtain information on the feasibility and effect of participation in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on HF severity and menopause-related quality of life.Design: Fifteen women volunteers reporting a minimum of seven moderate to severe HFs per day at study intake attended the eight weekly MBSR classes at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Participants were assessed for menopause-related quality of life before beginning and at the conclusion of the MBSR program. Women also kept a daily log of their HFs through the course of the 7 weeks of the MBSR program and for 4 weeks after it.Results: Women's scores on quality-of-life measures increased significantly, and the median reported HF severity, calculated as the weekly average of a daily HF severity score, decreased 40% over the course of the 11 weeks of the assessment period. The women were individually interviewed at the completion of their participation, and the results of the interviews were consistent with the results from daily diaries.Conclusions: These results provide preliminary positive evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of MBSR in supporting women who are experiencing severe HFs, and it warrants further investigation.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Mindfulness Education Program in Primary Health Care Professionals: A Pragmatic Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionBurnout is a very prevalent type of stress among health professionals. It affects their well-being, performance, and attitude toward patients. This study assessed the effectiveness of a training program for primary health care professionals designed to reduce burnout and mood disturbance, increase empathy, and develop mindfulness.MethodsPragmatic randomized controlled trial with pre- and postintervention measurements of 68 primary health care professionals (43 in the intervention and 25 in the control group) in Spain. The intervention consisted of presentations of clinically relevant topics, mindfulness-based coping strategies, mindfulness practice, yoga, and group discussions (8 sessions of 2.5hours per week plus a 1-day session of 8hours). Outcome measures included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Profile of Mood States, Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Baer's Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on changes in personal habits and mindfulness practice. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks.ResultsThe intervention group improved in the 4 scales measured. The magnitude of the change was large in total mood disturbance (difference between groups -7.1; standardized effect-size [SES] 1.15) and mindfulness (difference between groups 11; SES 0.9) and moderate in the burnout (difference between groups -7; SES 0.74) and empathy scales (difference between groups 5.2; SES 0.71). No significant differences were found in the control group.DiscussionOur study supports the use of mindfulness-based programs as part of continuing professional education to reduce and prevent burnout, promote positive attitudes among health professionals, strengthen patient-provider relationships, and enhance well-being.

TI  - Immediate impact of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) among women with breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundMindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may have positive physiological and psychological benefits for breast cancer survivors. However, few studies involved a combination of the relevant literatures to confirm the effects.MethodsOur study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing interventions of MBCT and control protocols for alleviation of symptoms among breast cancer survivors. We calculated pooled mean differences (MDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using random effects models to estimate summary effect sizes.ResultsThirteen trials with 20-245 participants were considered in our studies; for the meta-analysis, 11 of these studies were eligible for assessment. The pooled meta-analysis results revealed that at the end of the MBCT intervention, participants' anxiety (SMD, - 0.70; 95% CI, - 1.26 to - 0.13; I-2 = 69%), pain (SMD, - 0.64; 95% CI, - 0.92 to - 0.37; I-2 = 0%), and depression (SMD, - 0.65; 95% CI, - 1.14 to - 0.17; I-2 = 75%) levels significantly decreased, and their mindfulness (MD, 8.83; 95% CI, 3.88 to 13.78; I-2 = 68%) levels significantly increased.ConclusionThe MBCT may be associated with improved pain, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. However, the quantitative analysis pointed to an inconclusive result due to moderate to high levels of heterogeneity among indicator of anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. Future work requires more studies to better elucidate the clinical significance of this possible association. The results suggest that MBCT is highly beneficial as an intervention for patients who have received treatment for breast cancer.

TI  - Qigong intervention for breast cancer survivors with complaints of decreased cognitive function
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week Qigong intervention to improve objectively and subjectively assessed cognitive function in breast cancer survivors who were 2months to 8years post completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.MethodsA randomized, single-blind, three-arm intervention pilot was conducted to compare Qigong to gentle exercise and survivorship support. Feasibility was measured by recruitment, group session attendance, and adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups. Changes in self-report and objectively measured cognitive function were compared between the three groups from baseline (T1) to completion of the intervention (T2) and 4weeks post intervention (T3).ResultsFifty participants consented (83% of desired sample) with an overall attrition rate of 28%. Attrition was highest for the gentle exercise group (50%). Group attendance adherence ranged from 44 to 67%. The a priori established rate of 75% weekly attendance was not achieved, nor was the goal of 75% adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups (7 to 41%). Self-report of cognitive function improved most for the Qigong group (p=.01). Improvement was demonstrated for the Trail Making A (gentle exercise, p=.007) and F-A-S verbal fluency (support group, p=.02) tests. Qigong participants reported the most reduction of distress (p=.02).ConclusionsThe study results suggest that mindfulness-based exercise may be superior to gentle exercise alone or survivorship support for improving self-report of cognitive function and distress after treatment for breast cancer. The mindfulness component may enhance the positive impact of exercise on cognitive function.

TI  - A non-randomized comparison of mindfulness-based stress reduction and healing arts programs for facilitating post-traumatic growth and spirituality in cancer outpatients
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Goals of work The aim of this study was to compare a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program and a healing through the creative arts (HA) program on measures of post-traumatic growth (PTGI-R), spirituality (FACIT-Sp), stress (SOSI), and mood disturbance (POMS) in cancer patients.Materials and methods A sample of cancer outpatients (MBSR, n=60; HA, n=44) with a variety of diagnoses chose to attend either an 8-week MBSR program or a 6-week HA program and were assessed pre- and post-intervention. The majority of participants were female, married, and had breast cancer.Main results Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that participants in both groups improved significantly over time on overall post-traumatic growth (p=0.015). Participants in the MBSR group improved on measures of spirituality more than those in the HA group (p=0.029). Participants in the MBSR group also showed more improvement than those in HA on measures of anxiety (POMS, p=0.038), anger (POMS, p=0.004), overall stress symptoms (SOSI, p=0.041), and mood disturbance (POMS, p=0.023). Several main effects of time were also observed in both groups. These results were found despite attrition in both groups.Conclusions Both programs may improve facilitation of positive growth after traumatic life experiences for those who choose to participate. MBSR may be more helpful than HA in enhancing spirituality and reducing stress, depression, and anger.

TI  - Mindfulness-based interventions for non-affective psychosis: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are routinely used in clinical practice, a comprehensive synthesis of the effectiveness of MBIs for non-affective psychosis has yet to be conducted. The aim of the present review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of MBIs including those with mindfulness as an active treatment component for alleviating symptoms of psychosis to inform future clinical practice. Methods A systematic review of studies published in journals or in dissertations in CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, ISRCTN, or CNKI from January 1990 until December 2020. A total of 31 eligible studies (n = 2146) were included. Results Effect-size estimates suggested that 22 independent samples (n = 1632) produced a statistically significant small effect for psychotic symptoms (g = -0.48), and with a clinically significant reduction of 50% from baseline (pooled OR: 1.84). Separate meta-analyses demonstrated small effects for affective symptoms (g = -0.44) and small-to-large positive effects for quality of life (g = 0.38), mindfulness skills (g = 0.45), and insight into illness/treatment (g = 1.35). The heterogeneity was high across the studies. Conclusion Results suggest that short-term MBIs can be beneficial for non-affective psychosis. Future research is needed to test the efficacy and safety of dedicated MBIs for this population group over a longer term. KEY MESSAGES Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, also known as non-affective psychosis, is the most chronic and debilitating type of psychosis, seriously affecting every aspect of a person's life, including social, occupational, or general functioning. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate formerly unexamined questions regarding the clinical significance of MBIs including yoga as an increasingly utilized, conceptualized psychological intervention on overall psychotic symptoms for people with non-affective psychosis. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies, suggesting that MBIs may be safe interventions, while there is robust evidence to support the view that MBIs are beneficial to young people in particular.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS): Results from a randomized controlled trial with 1 year follow-up
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a medically unexplained condition characterized by symptoms from multiple organ systems following the perception of common odorants. The condition can cause severe functional impairment for afflicted individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for individuals with MCS.Methods: The intention-to-treat sample (ITT) included 69 individuals who had been randomized to either MBCT or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome measure was the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI), which measures the following aspects of MCS: impact of MCS on daily life, symptoms, and reactions following chemical exposures. Secondary outcome measures included the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) and the anxiety and depression subscales of the symptom checklist 92 (SCL-92). Participants were assessed at baseline and post treatment and at follow-up periods of 6- and 12-months.Results: We found no effect of MBCT on the primary outcome, nor did we find an effect on levels of depression or anxiety. We did, however, find positive changes in illness perceptions, which were sustained at 12-month follow-up. Dropout rates were low, suggesting MBCT was well received and regarded as an acceptable intervention by individuals with MCS.Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that MBCT does not change overall illness status in individuals with MCS, but that MBCT positively changes emotional and cognitive representations. Possible explanations for these results are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Promoting a Healthy Lifestyle through Mindfulness in University Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study explored the effects of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention known asflow meditation(Meditacion-Fluir) in the improvement of healthy life behaviors. A sample of university students (n= 51) in Spain were randomly assigned to a seven-week mindfulness treatment or a waiting list control group. Results showed that compared to the control group, individuals in the mindfulness group demonstrated significant improvements across all outcome measures including healthy eating habits (balanced diet, intake rate, snacking between meals, decrease in consumption by negative emotional states, increased consumption by negative emotional states, amount of consumption, meal times, consumption of low-fat products), tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption, and resting habits. There were differences between males and females in some of these variables and a better effect of the treatment was evident in the females of the experimental group when compared to the males. Theflow meditationprogram shows promise for fostering a healthy lifestyle, thus decreasing behaviors related to maladaptive eating, tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption as well as negative rest habits in university students. This mindfulness program could significantly contribute to the treatment of eating disorders and addictions, wherein negative emotional states and impulsivity are central features of the condition.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction and an organizational health intervention on Dutch teachers' mental health
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) combined with an organizational health intervention. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in five Dutch secondary vocational schools. Teachers were assigned to Intervention Group 1 (IG1; MBSR) or 2 (IG2; MBSR and an organizational health intervention), or to the Waiting List Group. The primary outcome variable was mindfulness. Secondary outcomes included other mental health outcomes, work performance, personal competencies, and work-related perceptions. Data was collected before (T-0), immediately after (T-1), and three (T-2 ) and nine months (T-3) after the MBSR training and analyzed applying repeated measures between-subjects designs. As the additional intervention showed no effects, IG1 and 1G2 were merged (IG). MBSR had positive short-term effects on the total mindfulness score, its dimensions 'observing' and 'non-reactivity', and the work engagement dimension 'dedication'. Long-term effects were found for the total mindfulness score, its dimensions 'observing', 'nonreactivity', and 'non-judging', sleep quality complaints, negative emotions, and negative work-home interaction. IG displayed a larger short- and long-term decrease in organizational commitment. No significant differences were found for work performance, personal competencies, and work-related perceptions. Although teachers did not perceive a decrease in job demands after the training, they felt more mindful and lowered their organizational commitment. Their mental health improved and their dedication during work increased. These findings may suggest that enhanced mindfulness enabled them to mentally disengage from work during their leisure time, which allowed them to experience fewer symptoms of psychological strain.

TI  - A pragmatic preference trial of therapeutic yoga as an adjunct to group cognitive behaviour therapy versus group CBT alone for depression and anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Yoga has several mechanisms that make it a promising treatment for depression and anxiety, including physical activity, behavioural activation, and mindfulness. Following positive outcomes from adapted CBT interventions incorporating mindfulness-based practices, this study explored the effects of a therapeutic yoga program as an adjunct to group-based CBT for depression or anxiety. Methods: This was a pragmatic preference trial involving adults diagnosed with depression or anxiety in a regional primary mental healthcare service (n = 59), comparing transdiagnostic group CBT (n = 27) with transdiagnostic group CBT combined with an adjunct therapeutic yoga program (n = 32). A preference recruitment design allowed eligible participants (n = 35) to self-select into the adjunct program. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS) was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months follow up. Results: CBT + Yoga was an acceptable alternative to CBT alone. Significant reductions were observed in total DASS scores and the 3 subscales of the DASS for both groups, however CBT + Yoga showed significantly lower depressive and anxiety symptoms post-intervention, compared to CBT alone. CBT + Yoga also showed sustained reductions in depressive symptoms over three-months, and more rapid reductions in depressive symptoms, compared to CBT alone. Limitations: These findings should be considered preliminary due to the moderate sample size, with a rigorous randomised control trial necessary to definitively support the integration of yoga within mental health care to augment the benefits and uptake of transdiagnostic CBT for depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Complementing other mindfulness-based practices, therapeutic yoga shows promise as an adjunct to transdiagnostic CBT.

TI  - Technostressors - a boon or bane? Toward an integrative conceptual model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to highlight the positive and negative effects of technostressors on employee attitudes using psychological need satisfaction as an explanatory mechanism and mindfulness as an individual resource, thereby developing an integrative conceptual model. Design/methodology/approach A narrative literature review was performed in the technostress, job demands-resources and mindfulness literature to develop the propositions of the integrative conceptual model. Findings This paper posits psychological need satisfaction as a mediator in the process by which technostressors impact important employee outcomes. It also proposes mindfulness as a personal resource that helps alleviate technostressor induced burnout and foster work engagement. Research limitations/implications The proposed integrative conceptual framework provides some useful directions for future empirical research on this topic of growing importance. Practical implications Based on the findings of this paper, managers can devise and implement a technostressor-specific mitigation strategy to cope with information and communication technology-induced work demands. They can also introduce mindfulness-based programs to support positive outcomes when technostressors are present. Originality/value This paper is the first to theoretically delineate specific characteristics of technostressors as challenge and hindrance demands and makes interdisciplinary contributions by extending the role of psychological mechanisms such as psychological need satisfaction and personal resources such as mindfulness in work-related technology use research.

TI  - Self-Reported Long-Term Benefits of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Patients with Bipolar Disorder
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study focused on patients with bipolar disorder (BD), several years after their participation in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). It aimed at documenting sustained mindfulness practice, perceived long-term benefit from the program, and changes regarded as direct consequences of the intervention.Design: This cross-sectional survey took place at least 2 years after MBCT for 70.4% of participants.Location: It was conducted in two specialized outpatient units for BDs that are part of the Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland) and the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris (France).Subjects: Eligibility criteria were a diagnosis of BD according to DSM-IV and participation in at least four MBCT sessions. Response rate was 66.4%. The final sample included 71 outpatients (71.8% bipolar I, 28.2% bipolar II).Outcome measures: A questionnaire retrospectively assessed patient-perceived change, benefit from MBCT, and current mindfulness practice.Results: Proportions of respondents who practiced mindfulness at least once a week were 54.9% for formal practice (body scan, sitting meditation, mindful walking, or movements) and 57.7% for informal practice (mindful daily activities). Perceived benefit for the prevention of relapse was moderate, but patients acknowledged long-lasting effects and persistent changes in their way of life. Formal mindfulness practice at least once a week tended to be associated with increased long-lasting effects (p=0.052), whereas regular informal practice and mindful breathing were significantly associated with persistent changes in daily life (p=0.038) and better prevention of depressive relapse (p=0.035), respectively. The most frequently reported positive change was increased awareness of being able to improve one's health.Conclusions: Despite methodological limitations, this survey allowed documenting mindfulness practice and perceived sustained benefit from MBCT in patients with BD. Participants particularly valued increased awareness that they can influence their own health. Both informal and formal practices, when sustained in the long term, might promote long-lasting changes.

TI  - A RCT of psychotherapy in women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does adding psychological intervention to medical therapy improve nausea/vomiting, psychological symptoms, and pregnancy distress in women with moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)?SUMMARY ANSWER: Three weeks of medical therapy plus psychotherapy yielded statistically and clinically significant improvements in NVP-specific symptoms, anxiety/depression symptoms, and pregnancy distress, compared with medical therapy alone. what is known already: Pregnancy with nausea/vomiting is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Evidence supports the exploration of psychosocial reactions in addition to biochemical markers related to NVP.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study was performed at two obstetrics clinics in Iran. A total of 86 women, aged 18-40 years, between 6 and 12 weeks pregnant with moderate NVP, more than 5 years of education, and not currently practicing any relaxation techniques or undergoing any psychotherapy, were enrolled from June 2013 to November 2014.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 86 moderate NVP women were randomly allocated to either a control (medical therapy alone) or experimental (medical therapy plus psychotherapy) group. Block randomization was achieved using a paper list prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. The experimental group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily) for 3 weeks, and also received intensive mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in eight individual sessions (50 min each) over 3 weeks. The control group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily tablet) for 3 weeks alone. All participants completed the Rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and retching (RINVR), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the prenatal distress questionnaire (PDQ) at baseline, 3 weeks after baseline at the end of the study, and at a 1 month post-treatment follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were used, in an intention-to-treat analysis.MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: In the psychotherapy plus medical therapy group, the mean relative difference between baseline and post-treatment decreased for RINVR; nausea 8.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1, 10.2), vomiting 3.5 (95% CI 1.5, 5.8), and total RINVR 11.7 (95% CI 6.5, 16.5), for HADS; anxiety 5.1 (95% CI 3.2, 9.2), depression 3.5 (95% CI 2.4, 7.3), total HADS 7.2 (95% CI 4.4, 12.1), for PDQ; birth concerns 3.3 (95% CI 1.3, 9.1), body concerns 1.5 (95% CI 0.9, 5.1), relationship concerns 2.1 (95% CI 1.2, 5.9), and total PDQ 5.9 (95% CI 3.5, 10.6). At 1 month after treatment, the statistically significant improvement in RINVR, HADS and PDQ, as well as clinical improvement in severity of symptoms, persisted. Medical therapy plus psychotherapy also improved nausea/vomiting symptoms, psychological symptoms, and reduced pregnancy distress more than medical therapy alone, with an effect size of 0.42-0.72 over the trial period.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The conclusions were limited to a small number of women with moderate NVP. It is unclear whether the difference between the outcomes in the different groups was related to MBCT alone, or to the extra time and attention paid to patients in the medical therapy plus psychotherapy. The participants in the study did not remain blind to the treatment and the outcome may only be representative of women with moderate NVP who have been referred to obstetrics clinics.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings show that adding 3 weeks of psychological intervention to medical therapy may appear to produce positive therapeutic outcomes upon conclusion of treatment, and 1 month after treatment. This suggests that psychotherapy should be considered as an adjunctive treatment option for women with moderate NVP. In future studies, however, a group of patients who are receiving placebo psychotherapy along with medical treatment should be included. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of the addition of psychological intervention to standard medical therapy would be useful.

TI  - Brief loving-kindness meditation reduces racial bias, mediated by positive other-regarding emotions
T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between positive emotions and implicit racial prejudice is unclear. Interventions using positive emotions to reduce racial bias have been found wanting, while other research shows that positive affect can sometimes exacerbate implicit prejudice. Nevertheless, loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has shown some promise as a method of reducing bias despite increasing a broad range of positive emotions. A randomised control trial (n = 69) showed that a short-term induction of LKM decreased automatic processing, increased controlled processing, and was sufficient to reduce implicit prejudice towards the target's racial group but not towards a group untargeted by the meditation. Furthermore, the reduction in bias was shown to be mediated by other-regarding positive emotions alongside increased control and decreased automaticity on the IAT. Non-other-regarding positive emotions conversely showed no correlation with bias. The study is the first to show that a short-term positive emotional induction can reduce racial prejudice, and aids the understanding of how positive emotions functionally differentiate in affecting bias.

TI  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of mindfulness-based triarchic body-pathway relaxation technique: A pilot study
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The "Triarchic body-pathway relaxation technique" (TBRT) is a form of ancient Chinese mindfulness-based meditation professed to give rise to positive emotions and a specific state of consciousness in which deep relaxation and internalized attention coexist. The purpose of this study was to examine the EEG pattern generated during the practice of this mindfulness exercise, and compare it to music listening which has been shown to induce positive emotions.Methods Nineteen college students (aged 19-22 years) participated in the study. Each participant listened to both the TBRT and music audiotapes while EEG was recorded. The order of presentation was counterbalanced to avoid order effect. Two EEG indicators were used: (1) alpha asymmetry index, an indicator for left-sided anterior activation, as measure of positive emotions, and (2) frontal midline theta activity, as a measure for internalized attention.Results Increased left-sided activation, a pattern associated with positive emotions, was found during both TBRT exercise and music conditions. However, only TBRT exercise was shown to exhibit greater frontal midline theta power, a pattern associated with internalized attention.Conclusions These results provided evidence to support that the TBRT gives rise to positive emotional experience, accompanied by focused internalized attention.

TI  - Therapygenetics in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: do genes have an impact on therapy-induced change in real-life positive affective experiences?
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Positive affect (PA) has an important role in resilience against depression and has been shown to increase with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of change in PA as well as develop insights that may benefit personalized medicine, the current study examined the contribution of genetic variation to individual differences in change in PA in response to MBCT. Individuals (n = 126) with residual depressive symptoms were randomized to either an MBCT group or treatment as usual. PA was assessed using experience sampling methodology (ESM). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes known to be involved in reward functioning were selected. SNPs in the genes for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (CHRM2), the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and the mu 1 opioid receptor (OPRM1) significantly moderated the impact of treatment condition over time on PA. Genetic variation in the genes for CHRM2 and OPRM1 specifically had an impact on the level of PA following MBCT. The current study shows that variation in response to MBCT may be contingent on genetic factors associated with the regulation of PA. These findings contribute to our understanding of the processes moderating response to treatment and prediction of treatment outcome.

TI  - Effect of blended and unguided online delivery of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus care as usual on distress among cancer patients and survivors: protocol for the three-arm parallel randomized controlled buddy trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background One third of cancer patients and survivors experience psychological distress. Previous studies have shown that online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) supports cancer patients and survivors in managing distress. Lack of peer support and asynchronicity during online interventions have been reported as barriers for treatment adherence and can result in higher drop-out rates. Considering this, two new formats of eMBCT were created. The primary objective of the Buddy trial is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of blended and unguided eMBCT versus care as usual (CAU) on psychological distress among cancer patients and survivors. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on other psychological outcomes and investigating working mechanisms and treatment effect moderators.Methods The Buddy trial is a parallel three-armed randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to blended therapist-assisted eMBCT, unguided individual eMBCT or CAU. Eligible participants will be Dutch-speaking adult cancer patients or survivors with access to internet. The primary outcome will be psychological distress scores as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale immediately post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures include fear of cancer recurrence (FCRI), fatigue (CIS-F), rumination (RRQ), mindfulness skills (FFMQ), decentering (EQ), self-compassion (SCS-SF), positive mental health (MHCSF), health related quality of life (EQ-5D), and costs associated with psychiatric illness (TiC-P). Outcome measures will be evaluated at baseline, mid-treatment, immediately posttreatment, and three-, six-, and nine-months follow-up. Possible mediators, such as engagement with interventions (TWEETS), and moderators will be also analyzed.Discussion There is room to improve eMBCT for cancer patients prior to implementation to ensure adherence and scalability. Blended and unguided eMBCT may reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life and be easily accessible to cancer patients and survivors.

TI  - Mindfulness-based retreat for mothers of paediatric heart transplant recipients: protocol for a pilot intervention study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Mothers are often the primary caregivers for children requiring heart transplantation. Given that a mother's ability to successfully cope with the demands of her caregiving role may be predictive of positive familial psychosocial outcomes, it is critical that maternal coping is assessed and supported in paediatric healthcare. Mindfulness-based programmes are proposed as one intervention that may enhance quality of life, improve distress tolerance and coping and reduce social isolation in caregiving populations. This pilot study aims to investigate: (1) the implementation success of a mindfulness-based retreat (MBR), and (2) the effectiveness of a MBR at improving quality of life, distress tolerance, coping and perceived social support for mothers of paediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods and analysis A convergent parallel, mixed-method design is proposed for this pilot, exploratory study. Twenty mothers will participate in this pilot MBR held at a resort in Ontario, Canada. Quantitative data will be obtained using five standardised instruments completed at three time points: (T1) 24-hours prior to the intervention, (T2) immediately on completion of the intervention, and (T3) three months post-intervention. Qualitative data will be collected from all participants both through semi-structured focus groups at T2 and individual telephone interviews at T3. Focus groups and individual interviews will be transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data will be merged and compared during interpretation to ensure that the intervention implementation and effectiveness of the MBR retreat are described with comprehensive accuracy. The primary outcomes will be feasibility in relation to implementation effectiveness and participants' perception of social support for efficacy of the MBR intervention. Ethics and dissemination This study received Institutional Research Ethics Board approval from The Hospital for Sick Children (Number: 1000064719). Informed consent will be obtained prior to participant enrolment. Findings will be disseminated via conference presentations and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Dispositional Mindfulness, Meditation, and Conditional Goal Setting.
T2  - Mindfulness
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Conditional goal setting (CGS, the tendency to regard high order goals such as happiness, as conditional upon the achievement of lower order goals) is observed in individuals with depression and recent research has suggested a link between levels of dispositional mindfulness and conditional goal setting in depressed patients. Since interventions which aim to increase mindfulness through training in meditation are used with patients suffering from depression it is of interest to examine whether such interventions might alter CGS. Study 1 examined the correlation between changes in dispositional mindfulness and changes in CGS over a 3-4 month period in patients participating in a pilot randomised controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Results indicated that increases in dispositional mindfulness were significantly associated with decreases in CGS, although this effect could not be attributed specifically to the group who had received training in meditation. Study 2 explored the impact of brief periods of either breathing or loving kindness meditation on CGS in 55 healthy participants. Contrary to expectation, a brief period of meditation increased CGS. Further analyses indicated that this effect was restricted to participants low in goal re-engagement ability who were allocated to loving kindness meditation. Longer term changes in dispositional mindfulness are associated with reductions in CGS in patients with depressed mood. However initial reactions to meditation, and in particular loving kindness meditation, may be counterintuitive and further research is required in order to determine the relationship between initial reactions and longer-term benefits of meditation practice.

TI  - A Wait-List Randomized Controlled Trial of Loving-Kindness Meditation Programme for Self-Criticism
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-criticism is a vulnerability risk factor for a number of psychological disorders, and it predicts poor response to psychological and pharmacological treatments. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) programme designed to increase self-compassion in a sample of self-critical individuals. Thirty-eight individuals with high scores on the self-critical perfectionism subscale of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale were randomized to an LKM condition (n=19) or a wait-list (WL) condition (n=19). Measures of self-criticism, self-compassion and psychological distress were administered before and immediately following the intervention (LKM or WL). WL participants received the intervention immediately after the waiting period. Both groups were assessed 3months post-intervention. Intent-to-treat (n=38) and per-protocol analyses (n=32) showed significant reductions in self-criticism and depressive symptoms as well as significant increases in self-compassion and positive emotions in the LKM condition compared with the WL condition. A follow-up per-protocol analysis in both groups together (n=20) showed that these gains were maintained 3months after the intervention. These preliminary results suggest that LKM may be efficacious in alleviating self-criticism, increasing self-compassion and improving depressive symptoms among self-critical individuals. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Key Practitioner Message: Self-criticism plays a major role in many psychological disorders and predicts poor response to brief psychological and pharmacological treatments for depression. The current study shows that loving-kindness meditation, designed to foster self-compassion, is efficacious in helping self-critical individuals become less self-critical and more self-compassionate. The study also suggests that practising loving-kindness may reduce depressive symptoms and increase positive emotions.

TI  - The Effect of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Flight Attendants' Spirituality, Mindfulness and Subjective Well-Being
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study investigated: (1) the effects of the loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on mindfulness, subjective well-being (SWB), and spirituality and (2) the relationships between mindfulness, spirituality, and SWB.Methods: 98 flight attendants from Xiamen Airlines in China were recruited and randomly assigned to the LKM training group (n= 49) or the waiting control group (n= 49). The LKM training group underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention, and the control group did not undergo intervention. The three main variables (SWB, mindfulness, and spirituality) were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention.Results: In the experimental group, SWB and spirituality increased significantly. In the control group, no significant differences were observed for the three variables between the pre-test and post-test.Conclusions: Our results indicated that LKM may help to improve SWB and spirituality. However, the mechanisms which underlie the effects of the LKM on mindfulness, spirituality, SWB, and other psychological constructs require further elucidation.

TI  - Examining the acceptability and feasibility of the Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme in adults living with chronic kidney disease: the COSMIC study findings
T2  - BMC NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Individuals with chronic kidney disease experience difficult physical and psychological symptoms, that impact quality of life, and are at increased risk of anxiety and depression. Access to specialist psychological support is limited. This study aimed to support a new service development project, in collaboration with Kidney Care UK, to implement the Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme, developed by MindfulnessUK, which provides accessible mindfulness techniques and practices to enhance compassion and resilience, and explore its feasibility for people living with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease and transplant. Methods A multi-method feasibility design was utilised. Participants over 18 years, from the UK, with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease or post-transplant, and who were not currently undergoing psychotherapy, were recruited to the four-week CMR programme. Data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and three-months post to measure anxiety, depression, self-compassion, mental wellbeing, resilience, and mindfulness. The acceptability of the intervention for a kidney disease population was explored through qualitative interviews with participants, and the Mindfulness Teacher. Results In total, 75 participants were recruited to the study, with 65 completing the CMR programme. The majority were female (66.2%) and post-transplant (63.1%). Analysis of completed outcome measures at baseline and post-intervention timepoints (n = 61), and three-months post intervention (n = 45) revealed significant improvements in participant's levels of anxiety (p < .001) and depression (p < .001), self-compassion (p = .005), mental wellbeing (p < .001), resilience (p.001), and mindfulness (p < .001).Thematic analysis of interviews with participants (n = 19) and Mindfulness Teacher (n = 1) generated three themes (and nine-subthemes); experiences of the CMR programme that facilitated subjective benefit, participants lived and shared experiences, and practicalities of programme participation. All participants interviewed reported that they found programme participation to be beneficial. Results In total, 75 participants were recruited to the study, with 65 completing the CMR programme. The majority were female (66.2%) and post-transplant (63.1%). Analysis of completed outcome measures at baseline and post-intervention timepoints (n = 61), and three-months post intervention (n = 45) revealed significant improvements in participant's levels of anxiety (p < .001) and depression (p < .001), self-compassion (p = .005), mental wellbeing (p < .001), resilience (p.001), and mindfulness (p < .001).

All participants interviewed reported that they found programme participation to be beneficial. Conclusion The findings suggest that the CMR programme has the potential to improve psychological outcomes among people with chronic kidney disease. Future randomized controlled trials are required to further test its effectiveness.

AB  - Mindfulness-informed interventions (MIIs) are increasingly common but have not been extensively studied among families with elevated levels of risk (e.g., those involved in child protective services and/or receiving financial assistance). These families often experience high rates of stressors that can impact coping strategies, interpersonal dynamics, and relationships. Given that mindfulness has been shown to promote health and wellbeing, this study used a sample from two pilot randomized controlled trials to test the extent to which a mindfulness-informed intervention improved coping strategies and perceptions of children's behavior among 53 families with elevated risk. A principal components analysis with a direct oblimin rotation revealed that cognitive-emotion coping strategies could be characterized by three factors: positive adaptation, negative adaptation, and positive refocusing. Intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant group by time differences, with intervention participants demonstrating improvements in positive refocusing coping, positive adaptation coping, and perceptions of children's behavior problems compared to participants in the waitlist control group. No significant differences were found for negative adaptation coping strategies. Findings provide preliminary support for the benefits of mindfulness training in a sample generally underrepresented in the mindfulness intervention literature.

TI  - Do mindfulness-based programmes improve the cognitive skills, behaviour and mental health of children and adolescents? An updated meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Question Mindfulness-based programmes (MBPs) are an increasingly popular approach to improving mental health in young people. Our previous meta-analysis suggested that MBPs show promising effectiveness, but highlighted a lack of high-quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This updated meta-analysis assesses the-state-of the-art of MBPs for young people in light of new studies. It explores MBP's effectiveness in active vs passive controls; selective versus universal interventions; and studies that included follow-up. Study selection and analysis We searched for published and unpublished RCTs of MBPs with young people (<19 years) in PubMed Central, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, EThOS, EBSCO and Google Scholar. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, and standardised mean differences (Cohen's d) were calculated. Findings Sixty-six RCTs, involving 20 138 participants (9552 receiving an MBP and 10 586 controls), were identified. Compared with passive controls, MBPs were effective in improving anxiety/stress, attention, executive functioning, and negative and social behaviour (d from 0.12 to 0.35). Compared against active controls, MBPs were more effective in reducing anxiety/stress and improving mindfulness (d=0.11 and 0.24, respectively). In studies with a follow-up, there were no significant positive effects of MBPs. No consistent pattern favoured MBPs as a universal versus selective intervention. Conclusions The enthusiasm for MBPs in youth has arguably run ahead of the evidence. While MBPs show promising results for some outcomes, in general, the evidence is of low quality and inconclusive. We discuss a conceptual model and the theory-driven innovation required to realise the potential of MBPs in supporting youth mental health.

TI  - Effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on cancer-related cognitive impairment: Results of a randomized controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging pilot study
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many breast cancer survivors suffer from cognitive complaints after cancer treatment, affecting their quality of life. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of a blended-care mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and functional brain changes. Furthermore, correlations between changes in cognitive functioning and self-reported behavioral factors were investigated. Methods Breast cancer survivors (n = 33) who reported cognitive impairment were randomly allocated to a mindfulness condition (n = 18) or a waitlist control condition (n = 15). Patients completed questionnaires on cognitive impairment, emotional distress, and fatigue; neuropsychological tests; and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before the start of MBI (time 1 [T1]), immediately after the completion of an 8-week MBI program (T2), and 3 months postintervention (T3). Resting-state functional connectivity was estimated in the default mode network, the dorsal and salience attention networks, and the frontoparietal network. Mixed model repeated-measures analysis was performed to test the intervention effect. Results Patients in the mindfulness condition exhibited significantly higher connectivity between the dorsal and salience attention networks after the mindfulness intervention compared with those in the control condition. MBI participants also had reduced subjective cognitive impairment, emotional distress, and fatigue. No intervention effect was observed on neurocognitive tests. Conclusions MBI may induce functional brain changes in networks related to attention and may have a positive effect on subjective measures of cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, MBI could be a suitable intervention to improve quality of life in this population and deserves further study in this context.

TI  - Virtual reality-based analgesia: towards a novel framework for the biopsychosocial management of chronic pain.
T2  - British journal of anaesthesia

M3  - Review
M3  - Editorial
AB  - Virtual reality (VR) holds unmeasured potential as a multicomponent tool for managing chronic pain by adapting conventional in-person biopsychosocial pain management strategies into one virtual space. We review recent evidence showcasing the successful integration of cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, embodiment techniques, and physical therapy into VR environments, demonstrating positive outcomes in patients with chronic pain. We propose that future clinical and basic research build on this by integrating pain neuroscience techniques to help better understand pathophysiological pain mechanisms and treatment response. This could help facilitate early assessment and personalised treatment of chronic pain using a VR-based biopsychosocial approach.

TI  - Improving the Wellbeing of Female Prisoners via Psychological Skills Training: A Feasibility Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prisoners display significantly higher rates of mental disorders and lower mental wellbeing than the general population. The integration of positive psychological interventions in offender supervision has received recent advocacy. The aim of the current pre-post pilot study was to determine the short-term effects of group-based resilience training on mental health outcomes for female offenders and explore intervention acceptability. Offenders (n = 24) self-selected to partake in a multi-component psychological skill program based on positive psychology, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and mindfulness-based activities. The training was taught in nine sessions of 1.5 hr each. Baseline and follow-up measurements of mental wellbeing and psychological distress were collected and focus groups conducted to investigate participants' experiences, acceptability, and appropriateness of the training. Moderate to large effect sizes indicating significant improvements were observed for wellbeing,g = 0.75 and distress,g = 0.56. Training was well received by participants and staff and was delivered feasibly within the prison context. The results are encouraging, and a future well-powered study using a rigorous controlled design is warranted.

TI  - The effect of loving-kindness meditation on positive emotions: a meta-analytic review.
T2  - Frontiers in psychology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - While it has been suggested that loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is an effective practice for promoting positive emotions, the empirical evidence in the literature remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic review of 24 empirical studies (N = 1759) on LKM with self-reported positive emotions. The effect of LKM on positive emotions was estimated with meta-analysis, and the influence of variations across LKM interventions was further explored with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed that (1) medium effect sizes for LKM interventions on daily positive emotions in both wait-list controlled RCTs and non-RCT studies; and (2) small to large effect sizes for the on-going practice of LKM on immediate positive emotions across different comparisons. Further analysis showed that (1) interventions focused on loving-kindness had medium effect size, but interventions focused on compassion showed small effect sizes; (2) the length of interventions and the time spent on meditation did not influence the effect sizes, but the studies without didactic components in interventions had small effect sizes. A few individual studies reported that the nature of positive emotions and individual differences also influenced the results. In sum, LKM practice and interventions are effective in enhancing positive emotions, but more studies are needed to identify the active components of the interventions, to compare different psychological operations, and to explore the applicability in clinical populations.

TI  - Evidence That a Brief Meditation Exercise Can Reduce Prejudice Toward Homeless People
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has shown that integrating social and clinical psychological perspectives can be effective when designing prejudice-interventions, with psychotherapeutic techniques successful at tackling anxiety in intergroup contexts. This research tests whether a single, brief loving-kindness meditation intervention, without containing any reference to the intergroup context, could reduce prejudice. This exercise was selected for its proven positive effects on mental and physical health. We observed that participants who took part in two variations of this meditation exercise (one involving a stranger, the other a homeless person) reported reduced intergroup anxiety, as well as more positive explicit attitudes, and enhanced future contact intentions. We conclude that combining approaches in intergroup relations and psychotherapy could be beneficial to design new interventions to combat prejudice and discrimination.

TI  - Effect of an Intensive Mindful Practice Workshop on Patient-Centered Compassionate Care, Clinician Well-Being, Work Engagement, and Teamwork
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Mindfulness-based interventions for health professionals have been linked to improvements in burnout, well-being, empathy, communication, patient-centered care, and patient safety, but the optimal formats and intensity of training have been difficult to determine because of the paucity of studies and the heterogeneity of programs. A 4-days residential "Mindful Practice" workshop for physicians and medical educators featuring contemplative practices, personal narratives, and appreciative dialogs about challenging experiences may hold promise in improving participants' well-being while also improving compassionate care, job satisfaction, work engagement, and teamwork. Methods: We collected baseline and 2-month follow-up data during four workshops conducted in 2018 to 2019 at conference centers in the United States and Europe. Primary outcomes were burnout, work-related distress, job satisfaction, work engagement, patient-centered compassionate care, and teamwork. Results: Eighty-five of 120 participants (71%) completed both surveys (mean age was 49.3 and 68.2% female). There were improvements (P < .01) in two of three burnout components (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization), work-related distress, job satisfaction, patient-centered compassionate care, work engagement and meaning, teamwork, well-being, positive emotion, mindfulness, somatic symptoms, and spirituality. Effect sizes (standardized mean difference of change) ranged from 0.25 to 0.61. With Bonferroni adjustments (P < .0031), teamwork, general well-being, and mindfulness became nonsignificant. Discussion: An intensive, multiday, mindfulness-based workshop for physicians had clinically significant positive effects on clinician well-being, quality of interpersonal care and work satisfaction, and meaning and engagement, all important indicators of improved health and sustainability of the health care workforce. Future iterations of the program should increase the focus on teamwork.

TI  - The impact of mindfulness-based interventions on the experiences of cancer patients: A qualitative meta-synthesis
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study analyzed qualitative research to explore cancer patients' perspectives on MBIs, including benefits, challenges, and recommendations. Methods: This systematic review focused on synthesizing qualitative data and was registered with PROSPERO under the protocol registration number xxx. Searched 7 databases for qualitative studies on MBIs & cancer patients (17 studies, 365 patients). Analyzed data using themes & assessed confidence in findings. Results: Thematic analysis using NVivo software revealed four significant themes: (1) benefits and positive outcomes (e.g., symptom improvement, team support, positive experiences), (2) challenges and difficulties (e.g., practice challenges, negative experiences), (3) the journey of change and acceptance (e.g., shifts in perception, personal growth, and acceptance), and (4) adaptations and recommendations (e.g., program modification and flexibility). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to offer cancer patients positive emotional experiences, increased team support, and opportunities for personal growth, self-discovery, and acceptance. This, in turn, can help them manage the psychological distress associated with cancer. Customizing programs to align with individual patients' needs and preferences can enhance engagement and effectiveness. Practice implications: Integrating MBIs into Patient Education and Counseling, tailored to individual needs and with ongoing support, can enhance cancer care. Group interventions foster peer support and effectiveness. Training providers and ensuring accessibility are crucial. Research and customization to patients' journeys optimize outcomes and satisfaction. A patient-centered approach is essential for positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes.

TI  - Effects of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Doctors' Mindfulness, Empathy, and Communication Skills
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the context of increasing doctor-patient tensions in China, the objective of this study was to explore and examine the effects of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on doctors' mindfulness, empathy, and communication skills. Methods: A total of 106 doctors were recruited from a hospital in China, and randomly divided into an LKM training group (n = 53) and waiting control group (n = 53). The LKM training group received 8 weeks of LKM training intervention, whereas the control group received no intervention. Three major variables (mindfulness, empathy, and communication skills) were measured before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. Results: The empathy and communication skills of the LKM group were significantly improved compared with those of the control group, but the level of mindfulness did not significantly change. Conclusions: The results suggested that LKM may contribute to improving physicians' empathy and communication skills. However, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of the LKM on mindfulness, empathy, and communication skills and other psychological constructs needs further elucidation.

T2  - MIDWIFERY
M3  - Article
AB  - An evaluation of mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting courses for pregnant women and prospective fathers/partners within the UK NHS (MBCP-4-NHS).Objective: To explore the usefulness within the National Health Service (NHS) of a brief (four week, ten hour) course based upon the Mindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) programme (Duncan and Bardacke, 2010) described here as MBCP-4-NHS.Background: The National Maternity Review (2016) and report of The Independent Mental Health Taskforce to the NHS (2016a, 2016b) in England highlight the need for significant investment into perinatal mental health services, with the Government pledging funding to improve such services through a range of measures. Whilst the field of mindfulness during the perinatal period is in need of well controlled trials and studies exploring the mechanisms of action (Hall et al., 2016) the limited research to date supports the potential for mindfulness based interventions in pregnancy and the need for further scientific study in this area (Dhillon et al., 2017; Shi and Macbeth, 2017). Particularly because it may broaden women's repertoire of coping strategies with the potential to improve the developmental trajectory of both parents and infants (Dunn et al., 2012; Duncan and Bardacke, 2010; Vieten and Astin, 2008). However, most of the studies to date have involved lengthy courses of around 8-9 weeks (24 h) duration, which may not be feasible or economical within a UK NHS setting and therefore, would be unlikely to be adopted as routine practice.Design: An initial pilot study to discover if MBCP-4-NHS is acceptable and feasible within NHS maternity services, comparing maternal and paternal pre and post intervention self-report measures of mental health to begin to explore the effectiveness of this intervention.Setting: NHS antenatal education classes held in children's centres for expectant parents across Oxfordshire.Participants: All expectant parents receiving Oxfordshire maternity services between October 2014 and January 2015 were invited to self-refer into the intervention, of which 155 individuals (86 women and 69 men) took part.Intervention: 'MBCP-4-NHS' - A brief (four week, ten hour) course developed from the nine week Mindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) intervention.Measures: Self-report measures of mental health including low mood/depression, mindfulness, stress, anxiety, pregnancy related distress and experiences.Findings: The results showed a significant increase in both maternal and paternal mental health with women demonstrating a significant improvement in symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, pregnancy-related distress, labour worry and positive and negative pregnancy experiences; and men improving significantly in symptoms of anxiety, depression and showing a trend for improvement in self-reported symptoms of perceived stress.Conclusions: This is a promising antenatal intervention that can be feasibly implemented within NHS which might have the potential to impact upon parental mental health and, therefore, possibly also the health of next generation. However, caution is needed interpreting these findings given that this study did not include an active control group.

TI  - Comparing state anxiety and mindfulness between mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation whilst controlling for the effect of altruism and boredom
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDAlthough it has been determined that mindfulness meditations are positively related to personality constructs such as conscientiousness, there is no clear evidence of whether personality can influence the effectiveness of mindfulness intervention. The aim of the current research was to investigate the immediate effects of single sessions of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on state anxiety and state mindfulness and establish whether there is a difference between the outcomes of the two practices. Altruism and boredom were used as covariates to observe whether they have a significant impact on the final results.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDUREUniversity students (N = 80) were randomly allocated to either the MM or LKM condition and were asked to complete the scales before and after they listened to audio guided meditation instructions. Prior to the meditation participants completed state mindfulness and state anxiety scales. Post-meditation participants again filled in state mindfulness and state anxiety scales, and trait scales on altruism and boredom.RESULTSThe results indicated that both types of mindfulness-based practices successfully decreased the initial levels of anxiety and elevated state mindfulness. Non-significant differences between the outcomes of the meditative practices were observed when controlling for altruism and boredom.CONCLUSIONSAlternative practices appeal more to some participants than to others. Clinical implications are discussed with a focus on the beneficial effects of both MM and LKM.

TI  - Positive psychological interventions for neurological disorders: A systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Psychological well-being in people with neurological diseases can be compromised due to brain damage or psychological reactions towards chronic disabilities. This systematic review evaluated the efficacy of positive psychological intervention (PPI) in neurological populations. Methods: Previous studies relevant to this topic were identified by searches in PUBMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PSYCINFO databases from Jan 1980 to August 2017. Results: Of 1361 articles identified, 31 studies were included. Nineteen studies were randomized controlled trials. Sixteen studies had sample sizes of less than 30. Twelve studies were rated as high quality using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) quality assessment tools. Six therapies were found: mindfulness-based approaches, positive savoring, life summary, expressive-based, hope-based interventions, and character strengths. These interventions were shown to improve quality of life, reduce symptomatic distress, and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: PPIs promote well-being among patients with neurological deficits. For PPIs to be considered as an evidence-based practice, more trials with adequate statistical power are required.

TI  - Mindfulness Training Increases Momentary Positive Emotions and Reward Experience in Adults Vulnerable to Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) increases momentary positive emotions and the ability to make use of natural rewards in daily life. Method: Adults with a life-time history of depression and current residual depressive symptoms (mean age = 43.9 years, SD = 9.6; 75% female; all Caucasian) were randomized to MBCT (n = 64) or waitlist control (CONTROL; n = 66) in a parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The Experience Sampling Method was used to measure momentary positive emotions as well as appraisal of pleasant activities in daily life during 6 days before and after the intervention. Residual depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960). Results: MBCT compared to CONTROL was associated with significant increases in appraisals of positive emotion (b* = .39) and activity pleasantness (b* = .22) as well as enhanced ability to boost momentary positive emotions by engaging in pleasant activities (b* = .08; all ps < .005). Associations remained significant when corrected for reductions in depressive symptoms or for reductions in negative emotion, rumination, and worry. In the MBCT condition, increases in positive emotion variables were associated with reduction of residual depressive symptoms (all ps < .05). Conclusions: MBCT is associated with increased experience of momentary positive emotions as well as greater appreciation of, and enhanced responsiveness to, pleasant daily-life activities. These changes were unlikely to be pure epiphenomena of decreased depression and, given the role of positive emotions in resilience against depression, may contribute to the protective effects of MBCT against depressive relapse.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation to Enhance Recovery From Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we describe the clinical applicability of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) to individuals suffering from schizophrenia-spectrum disorders with persistent negative symptoms. LKM may have potential for reducing negative symptoms such as anhedonia, avolition, and asociality while enhancing factors consistent with psychological recovery such as hope and purpose in life. Case studies will illustrate how to conduct this group treatment with clients with negative symptoms, the potential benefits to the client, and difficulties that may arise. Although LKM requires further empirical support, it promises to be an important intervention since there are few treatments for clients afflicted with negative symptoms.

TI  - A brief induction of loving kindness meditation to reduce anti-fat bias
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Weight stigma is highly prevalent. However, existing weight stigma interventions are only modestly effective at reducing anti-fat attitudes. The current research proposes a novel approach using a loving kindness meditation (LKM). Experiment 1 tests whether random assignment to the LKM intervention reduces explicit and implicit anti-fat bias and increases empathy based on the LKM recipient with higher weight (close other vs. stranger). Experiment 2 tests whether LKM outperforms an empathy intervention or control to increase empathy or reduce stigmatizing behavior. Results revealed that the LKM increased empathic care but did not reduce anti-fat bias compared to control; the LKM intervention, but not the empathy intervention, reported greater empathy compared to control in unadjusted analyses; and participants in the LKM and empathy interventions (vs. control) were more likely to engage in stigmatizing behavior. These findings suggest that the LKM may not be effective at reducing weight stigma despite increasing empathy.

TI  - Is informal practice associated with outcomes in loving-kindness and compassion training? Evidence from pre-post and daily diary assessments
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated whether informal meditation practice (i.e., self -reported application of meditative techniques outside a period of formal meditation) was associated with outcomes in smartphone-based loving -kindness and compassion training. Meditation -na & iuml;ve participants ( n = 351) with clinically elevated symptoms completed measures of psychological distress, loneliness, empathy, and prosociality at baseline and following a two-week intervention. Informal practice, psychological distress, and loneliness were also assessed daily. Steeper increases in informal practice had small associations with pre -post improvements in distress ( r = -.18, p = .008) and loneliness ( r = -.19, p = .009) but not empathy or prosociality. Using a currently recommended approach for establishing cross -lagged effects in longitudinal data (latent curve model with structured residuals), higher current -day informal practice was associated with decreased next -day distress with a very small effect size ( beta s = -.06 to -.04, p = .018) but not decreased next -day loneliness. No cross -lagged associations emerged from distress or loneliness to informal practice. Findings suggest that further investigation into a potential causal role of informal practice is warranted. Future studies experimentally manipulating informal practice are needed.

TI  - Is It the Symptom or the Relation to It? Investigating Potential Mediators of Change in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Psychosis
T2  - BEHAVIOR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive and behavioral interventions have been shown to be efficacious when used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for psychotic disorders. However, little previous research has investigated potential mediators of change in psychological treatments for psychosis. Acceptance and mindfulness-based therapies do not focus on directly reducing the psychotic symptoms themselves, but instead attempt to alter the patient's relationship to symptoms to decrease their negative impact. The current study examined this issue with data from a previously published randomized trial comparing brief treatment with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) versus treatment as usual for hospitalized patients with psychotic symptoms (Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006a). Results showed that the believability of hallucinations at posttreatment statistically mediated the effect of treatment condition on hallucination-related distress. Hallucination frequency did not mediate outcome. The current study is a first step toward understanding the potential mechanisms of action in psychological treatments for psychosis.

TI  - A Qualitative Study of a Compassion, Presence, and Resilience Training for Oncology Interprofessional Teams
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOLISTIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The well-being of health care providers may be challenged by their work, with evidence that oncology health care providers are a high-risk group for burnout. The present qualitative pilot study evaluated a mindfulness-based group intervention, referred to as Compassion, Presence, and Resilience Training (CPR-T), for oncology interprofessional teams. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the subjective experience of oncology health care providers receiving CPR-T and their perceptions of its benefits, risks, or challenges. The CPR-T was delivered to providers from two oncology teams in a large cancer center in Canada. Ten of these providers participated in semistructured interviews 1 to 5 months after completing the CPR-T. The interview transcripts were coded using a thematic analysis strategy. Five benefits of the CPR-T were identified: learning to pause, acquiring a working definition of stress and self-care, becoming fully present, building self-compassion, and receiving organizational acknowledgment and recognition of stress. In addition, two participant-identified challenges were recognized: sharing vulnerability within interprofessional teams and committing to a sitting meditation practice. These findings demonstrate positive transformations as a result of the CPR-T, as well as important challenges, and have important implications for holistic health care practice in oncology. Further research is necessary to validate the findings of this explorative study.

TI  - A systematic review of mechanisms of change in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The investigation of treatment mechanisms in randomized controlled trials has considerable clinical and theoretical relevance. Despite the empirical support for the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), the specific mechanisms by which MBCT leads to therapeutic change remain unclear.Objective: By means of a systematic review we evaluate how the field is progressing in its empirical investigation of mechanisms of change in MBCT for recurrent MDD.Method: To identify relevant studies, a systematic search was conducted. Studies were coded and ranked for quality.Results: The search produced 476 articles, of which 23 were included. In line with the theoretical premise, 12 studies found that alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness were associated with, predicted or mediated MBCT's effect on treatment outcome. In addition, preliminary studies indicated that alterations in attention, memory specificity, self-discrepancy, emotional reactivity and momentary positive and negative affect might play a role in how MBCT exerts its clinical effects.Conclusion: The results suggest that MBCT could work through some of the MBCT model's theoretically predicted mechanisms. However, there is a need for more rigorous designs that can assess greater levels of causal specificity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for people with chronic diseases
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that uses mindfulness meditation to improve well-being and alleviate suffering. This article reviews the impact of MBSR for people with chronic diseases. The review includes original research that was published in English and peer-reviewed and reported outcomes for adults with chronic diseases who had participated in an MBSR program. Fifteen studies were identified. Outcomes related to mental and physical health, well-being, and quality of life The studies included different research designs, and used self-report and physiological outcome measures Participants' clinical diagnoses included fibromyalgia, chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, and cardiovascular diagnoses. All 15 studies found that participation in an MBSR program resulted in improvements. No negative change was reported between baseline and follow up Outcomes in regard to specific variables were difficult to compare and equivocal Overall, positive change predominated. Chronic diseases are associated with a range of unwelcome psychological and physical consequences. Participation in an MBSR program is likely to result in coping better with symptoms, improved overall well-being and quality of life, and enhanced health outcomes. As an adjunct to standard care, M BSI has potential for much wider application in Australian primary care settings.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of Mindkeys Training, a mindfulness-based educational intervention, on attention, self-control, and aggressiveness in third-year primary school pupils. In order to achieve this aim, a switching replications design was used. Two groups of third year primary students (n(GE1) = 40; n(GE2) = 33), aged between 7 and 10 years old (M = 8.08; DT = 0.49), had the intervention at different time points, such that while one served as the experimental group, the other served as the control group. Longitudinal differences were examined in both groups, and cross-sectional differences were examined between the two groups at three time points; at the start of the study, and following the intervention with each group. To that end, measurements of problems of attention, deficits of self-control, and aggressiveness for students were obtained via a teacher rating scale. The intervention program demonstrated a positive effect on the reduction of pupils' attention problems, deficits of self-control, and aggressiveness. The effects were greater on the cognitive variables that the intervention worked on directly (attention and self-control). Attention was the variable on which the intervention exhibited the longest term effects.

TI  - Mindfulness-Informed Guided Imagery to Target Physical Activity: A Mixed Method Feasibility and Acceptability Pilot Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Physical activity offers substantial mind-body health benefits and reduced mortality, yet many individuals are chronically underactive. Physical activity interventions may benefit from integrative approaches that join components of mindfulness and neurobiological models of behavior. Mindfulness increases one's awareness of cognitions and physical sensations to potentially facilitate self-regulation, while neurobiological models such as the dual system model of health behavior offer guidance on improving physical activity intervention targets. This 2-phase study includes an initial development process to create brief (similar to 4 min) mindfulness informed guided imagery audio files that target distinct cognitive and affective processes to promote physical activity. In the second phase, participants completed a 2-week pilot intervention study to gather qualitative and quantitative data on intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants endorsed the mindfulness informed guided imagery as easy to use, enjoyable and helpful. Over a 2-week intervention period participants reported positive shifts in behavior change, physical activity enjoyment, increased mindfulness during physical activity, and increased physical exercise self-efficacy and satisfaction. Interview data revealed that participants increased their frequency of physical activity and tended to experience positive affect during physical activity, engaged in future oriented thinking and were able to view physical activity in a more positive light. Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of an integrative online mindfulness informed guided imagery intervention to promote physical activity enjoyment and engagement. This study extends health behavior change intervention research and provides supporting evidence for a flexible and tailorable online mindfulness-based intervention.

TI  - Pilot randomised controlled trial of a brief mindfulness-based intervention for those with persistent pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A pilot-randomised controlled trial (RCT) examined the effects of a brief mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on persistent pain patients and assessed the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT. A brief (15 min) mindfulness body-scan audio was compared with an active control administered in a clinic and then used independently over 1 month. Immediate effects of the intervention were assessed with brief measures of pain severity, distraction and distress. Assessments at baseline, 1 week and 1 month included pain severity and interference, mood, pain-catastrophizing, mindfulness, self-efficacy, quality of life and intervention acceptability. Of 220 referred patients, 147 were randomised and 71 completed all assessments. There were no significant immediate intervention effects. There were significant positive effects for ratings of intervention 'usefulness' at 1 week (p = 0.044), and pain self-efficacy at 1 month (p = 0.039) for the MBI group compared with control. Evidently, it is feasible to recruit persistent pain patients to a brief MBI study. Strategies are needed to maximise retention of participants.

TI  - Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) reduces depression-related self-referential processing in patients with bipolar disorder: an exploratory task-based study
T2  - COGNITION & EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative self-referential processing has fruitfully been studied in unipolar depressed patients, but remarkably less in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). This exploratory study examines the relation between task-based self-referential processing and depressive symptoms in BD and their possible importance to the working mechanism of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for BD. The study population consisted of a subsample of patients with BD (n = 49) participating in an RCT of MBCT for BD, who were assigned to MBCT + TAU (n = 23) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 26). Patients performed the self-referential encoding task (SRET), which measures (1) positive and (2) negative attributions to oneself as well as (3) negative self-referential memory bias, before and after MBCT + TAU or TAU. At baseline, all three SRET measures were significantly related to depressive symptoms in patients with BD. Moreover, repeated measures analyses of variance revealed that negative self-referential memory bias diminished over time in the MBCT + TAU group, compared with the TAU group. Given the preliminary nature of our findings, future research should explore the possibly mediating role of reducing negative self-referential memory bias in preventing and treating depressive symptoms in BD through MBCT.

TI  - The Impact of Delivering Mindfulness-Based Programmes in Schools: A Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been an increased interest in the delivery of Mindfulness-Based Programmes (MBPs) in schools yet little is known about how people who deliver MBPs in schools carry out and experience implementation. In this qualitative study, we aimed to examine the experiences of school staff who have a personal mindfulness practice, and who also deliver MBPs to their students. We recruited eight school staff (age range 34-64) who taught students mindfulness, and carried out semi-structured interviews focusing on investigating their positive and negative experiences of delivering mindfulness in schools, how practicing and delivering mindfulness affected their work-life, and their experiences of implementing school-based MBPs. School staff reported that delivering MBPs deepened their own mindfulness practice. The practice enabled them to feel better attuned to others, increased compassion for both themselves and students, helped their emotional regulation, and enhanced resilience to stress. Unexpectedly, half of the participants reported making changes to their work roles and several explicitly linked these changes to the increased self-compassion developed through mindfulness practice. They reported enjoying teaching school students MBPs (and noted that some students embraced mindfulness, and some were reluctant to engage) and sometimes found driving the implementation of MBPs in their school challenging. There appear to be numerous benefits of a personal mindfulness practice for school staff and delivering school-based MBPs can increase feelings of personal accomplishment. Future research is needed into whether MBPs can improve student-teacher relationships, and how some schools have successfully implemented MBPs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proven to be detrimental to the psychological well-being of healthcare providers (HCP). This study was a psychological intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic to check extent to which brief mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) affect psychological well-being, resilience, and anxiety of HCPs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized trial study conducted from July to August 2020. One hundred and forty-seven COVID-19 frontline HCPs were randomized to a 2-week virtual intervention with a brief MBI or a PMR. Pre- and postintervention assessments were done using the State-Trait Anxiety-20-Item Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, and WHO-5 Well-Being Index.RESULTS: The final sample included 125 HCPs (64 in BMI group and 61 in PMR group) who completed pre- and post-intervention assessment. The results showed a significant improvement in the psychological well-being and reduction of the state anxiety of the two groups, but not in the trait anxiety or resiliency. Improvement was more in the group's brief MBI (81.3%) than in the group's PMR (51.8%) (P = 0.0001), concerning psychological well-being.CONCLUSION: Both the brief MBI and PMR improved the psychological well-being and reduced the anxiety of frontline healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic with a slightly better improvement in the brief MBI.

TI  - Buddhist-Derived Loving-Kindness and Compassion Meditation for the Treatment of Psychopathology: a Systematic Review
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although clinical interest has predominantly focused on mindfulness meditation, interest into the clinical utility of Buddhist-derived loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion meditation (CM) is also growing. This paper follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and provides an evaluative systematic review of LKM and CM intervention studies. Five electronic academic databases were systematically searched to identify all intervention studies assessing changes in the symptom severity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (text revision fourth edition) Axis I disorders in clinical samples and/or known concomitants thereof in subclinical/healthy samples. The comprehensive database search yielded 342 papers and 20 studies (comprising a total of 1,312 participants) were eligible for inclusion. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was then used to assess study quality. Participants demonstrated significant improvements across five psychopathology-relevant outcome domains: (i) positive and negative affect, (ii) psychological distress, (iii) positive thinking, (iv) interpersonal relations, and (v) empathic accuracy. It is concluded that LKM and CM interventions may have utility for treating a variety of psychopathologies. However, to overcome obstacles to clinical integration, a lessons-learned approach is recommended whereby issues encountered during the (ongoing) operationalization of mindfulness interventions are duly considered. In particular, there is a need to establish accurate working definitions for LKM and CM.

TI  - Prospective examination of the therapeutic role of psychological flexibility and cognitive reappraisal in the ceremonial use of ayahuasca
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence suggests that psychedelic-assisted therapy carries transdiagnostic efficacy in the treatment of mental health conditions characterized by low mood and the use of avoidance coping strategies. Aims: While preliminary evidence suggests that psychological flexibility and emotion regulation processes play an important role within psychedelic therapy, this prospective study addressed methodological gaps in the literature and examined the ability of ayahuasca to stimulate acute states of cognitive reappraisal and long-term changes in psychological flexibility and mood. The study also explored whether moderating factors predisposed participants to experience therapeutic changes. Methods: Participants (N = 261) were recruited from three Shipibo ayahuasca retreat centers in Central and South America and completed assessments on mood, psychological flexibility, and acute ceremonial factors. Expectancy, demand characteristics, and invalid responding were controlled for with several validity scales. Results/Outcomes: Participants reported significant reductions in negative mood after three months, as well as increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Acute experiences of reappraisal during the ayahuasca ceremony exerted the strongest moderating effects on increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Increases in psychological flexibility statistically mediated the effects of acute psychological factors, including reappraisal, on changes in positive mood. Conclusions/Interpretation: These results highlight the role of acute psychological processes, such as reappraisal, and post-acute increases in psychological flexibility as putative mechanisms underlying positive outcomes associated with psychedelics. These results also provide support for the integration of third-wave and mindfulness-based therapy approaches with psychedelic-assisted interventions.

TI  - A novel mindful-compassion art therapy (MCAT) for reducing burnout and promoting resilience for end-of-life care professionals: a waitlist RCT protocol
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionEnd-of-life (EoL) care professionals are prone to burnout given the intense emotional nature of their work. Previous research supports the efficacy of art therapy in reducing work-related stress and enhancing emotional health among professional EoL caregivers. Integrating mindfulness meditation with art therapy and reflective awareness complementing emotional expression has immense potential for self-care and collegial support. Mindful-compassion art therapy (MCAT) is a novel, empirically informed, and highly structured intervention that aims to reduce work-related stress, cultivate resilience, and promote wellness. This study aims to assess the potential effectiveness of MCAT for supporting EoL care professionals in Singapore.MethodsThis is an open-label waitlist randomized controlled trial. Sixty EoL care professionals, including doctors, nurses, social workers, and personal care workers, are randomly allocated to one of two groups: (i) an intervention group that receives MCAT immediately and (ii) a waitlist-control group that receives MCAT after the intervention group completes treatment. Face-to-face self-administered outcome assessments are collected at three different time points-baseline (T1) for both groups, post-intervention (T2), and 6-week follow-up (T3) for intervention group-as well as pre-intervention (T2) and post-intervention (T3) for the waitlist-control group. The primary outcome measure is burnout, and secondary measures include emotional regulation, resilience, compassion, quality of life, and death attitudes. Between- and within-participant comparisons of outcomes are conducted, and the appropriate effect size estimates are reported. An acceptability and feasibility study is to be conducted by using a triangulation of qualitative data with framework analysis.DiscussionThe outcomes of this study will contribute to advancements in both theories and practices for supporting professional EoL caregivers around the world. It will also inform policy makers about the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of delivering a multimodal psycho-socio-spiritual intervention within a community institutional setting. The study has received ethical approval from the institutional review board of Nanyang Technological University.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03440606.

TI  - Mindfulness Meditation Reduces Guilt and Prosocial Reparation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research investigates whether and how mindfulness meditation influences the guilt-driven tendency to repair harm caused to others. Through a series of eight experiments (N > 1,400), we demonstrate that state mindfulness cultivated via focused-breathing meditation can dampen the relationship between transgressions and the desire to engage in reparative prosocial behaviors. Experiment 1 showed that induced state mindfulness reduced state guilt. Experiments 2a-2c found that induced state mindfulness reduced the willingness to engage in reparative behaviors in normally guilt-inducing situations. Experiments 3a and 3b found that guilt mediated the negative effect of mindfulness meditation on prosocial reparation. Experiment 4 demonstrated that induced state mindfulness weakened the link between a transgression and reparative behavior, as well as documented the mediating role of guilt over and above other emotions. Finally, in Experiment 5, we found that loving kindness meditation led to significantly more prosocial reparation than focused-breathing meditation, mediated by increased other-focus and feelings of love. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.

TI  - Attachment Insecurity Moderates Emotion Responses to Mindfulness and Loving-Kindness Meditation in Adults Raised in Low Socioeconomic Status Households
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on attachment theory holds that insecure attachment influences people's daily social and emotional experiences. Mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation have been associated with improvements in physical and mental well-being often through their influence on emotion experience and regulation. Yet, little research has examined how emotional well-being may be improved in insecurely attached individuals through meditation practice. We suspected that the emotion profiles of anxious and avoidant attachment may shift with meditation training, both across time and on a particular day. Improving emotional well-being may be especially consequential for those most at risk for negative health outcomes in late life. A diverse community sample of midlife adults raised in low-SES homes (N = 113; 55% white, 87.5% female) completed daily emotion reports for 10 weeks, during which they received 6 weeks of meditation training, randomized to either loving-kindness or mindfulness meditation practice. Results from growth curve analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety and randomized to mindfulness meditation reported significant increases over time in positive emotions alongside decreases in negative emotions. Those high in attachment avoidance reported significant decreases in negative emotions in both meditation groups. On the daily level, within-person dose-response analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety showed the most consistent dose-response relations between the duration of either meditation practice and same-day increases in positive emotions and decreases in negative emotions. These findings highlight how meditation interventions can shift emotion profiles of insecurely attached midlife adults who are at heightened risk for late life chronic illnesses.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness Training on Sleep Problems in Patients With Fibromyalgia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex psychosomatic pain condition. In addition to generalized pain and various cognitive difficulties, new FMS diagnostic criteria acknowledge fatigue and sleep problems as core aspects of this condition. Indeed, poor sleep quality has been found to be a significant predictor of pain, fatigue, and maladaptive social functioning in this patient group. While there is promising evidence supporting the role of mindfulness as a treatment for FMS, to date, mindfulness intervention studies have principally focused on dimensions of pain as the primary outcome with sleep problems either not being assessed or included as a secondary consideration. Given the role of sleep problems in the pathogenesis of FMS, and given that mindfulness has been shown to improve sleep problems in other clinical conditions, the present study explored the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention known as Flow Meditation (Meditacion-Fluir) on a range of sleep-related outcomes (subjective insomnia, sleep quality, sleepiness, and sleep impairment) in individuals with FMS. Adult women with FMS (n = 39) were randomly assigned to the 7 weeks mindfulness treatment or a waiting list control group. Results showed that compared to the control group, individuals in the mindfulness group demonstrated significant improvements across all outcome measures and that the intervention effects were maintained at a 3 month follow-up assessment. The Meditacion-Fluir program shows promise for alleviating sleep problems relating to FMS and may thus have a role in the treatment of FMS as well as other pain disorders in which sleep impairment is a central feature of the condition.

TI  - Effects of loving-kindness meditation on prosocial behavior: empirical and meta-analytic evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeBrief loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is introduced here as a valid social marketing intervention. LKM positively influences prosocial cognitions and affects. However, it remains unclear whether brief meditation interventions can influence prosocial behavior. This study aims to provide evidence of the effects of short LKM on prosocial behavior.Design/methodology/approachThis study reports the results of three experiments examining the effects of brief LKM on donations to unknown others. The results are then integrated with the results of seven other studies testing the effects of brief LKM on prosocial behavior using a meta-analysis (n = 683).FindingsLKM increased love more than the control group (focused breathing) in the three experiments; however, its effects on donations were mixed. The meta-analysis shows that LKM has a small-to-medium significant effect compared to active control groups (d = 0.303); moreover, age and type of prosocial measure used moderate the effects.Originality/valueResults suggest that LKM can nurture prosocial emotions such as love and lead young individuals to donate. However, these emotions may not be sufficient to lead adult meditators to share their resources with unknown others. This study presents the first meta-analysis of brief LKM and provides insights into the use of meditation in social marketing programs.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction Program in Improving Mental Well-being of Patients with COVID-19: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Mental well-being is one of the most important aspects of health. Life-threatening situations such as diseases affect mental wellbeing. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program is an effective program for improving well-being. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MBSR programs on the mental well-being of patients with COVID-19.Methods: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted in 2021. We used simple random sampling for recruiting 60 patients with COVID-19 and assigned them to the intervention and control groups. The intervention comprised eight sessions of the MBSR and was performed for the experimental group. The control group received routine post-discharge care. We used a self-report demographic and Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale to collect data. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics including Covariance, MANCOVA, and effect coefficient were used. The Significance level was considered lower than 0. 05. We used SPSS version 21 for data management.Results: The mean score of mental well-being in the intervention group was 56.76 +/- 6.88 in the pretest stage and 80.76 +/- 7.53 in the post-test stage, and that in the control group was 54.40 +/- 10.31 in the pretest stage and 51.23 +/- 10.08 in the post-test stage. There was no significant difference between the two groups before the intervention (p > 0.05) but there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) after the intervention. There was also a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the dimensions of mental well-being before and after the intervention.Conclusion: According to our findings, it is recommend to use MBSR program in line with physical treatment for patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Physical Activity and Psychological Resilience in Older Adults: A Systematic Review of the Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Older adults face numerous unfavorable functional changes caused by aging, but many exhibit resilience, which helps them cope with challenges. Physical activity is positively associated with resilience. Therefore, this systematic literature review aimed to uncover the relationships between physical activity and resilience in older adults. We have analyzed three freely and openly available databases: (a) PubMed/Medline, (b) ScienceDirect, and (c) Google Scholar, which yielded 20 eligible articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies (14) were cross-sectional, three were longitudinal, and three others used mindfulness-based or endurance-enhancing physical activity interventions. Their results revealed increased resilience even after short-duration and low-frequency interventions. Cross-sectional research results also support the positive relationship between physical activity and resilience in older adults, suggesting that the relationship might depend on exercise volume. Still, further research is needed to design interventions, understand the mechanism(s) involved in altering resilience, and maximize physical activity's benefits in aging people.

TI  - Mindfulness and loving-kindness
T2  - CONTEMPORARY BUDDHISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness, as the word is commonly used in contemporary meditation teaching, refers to both being aware of our present moment's experience, and relating to that experience without grasping, aversion or delusion. All three habitual tendencies distort our perception of what is happening, and lead us to futile and misguided efforts to deny or control our experience. Loving-kindness is a quality of the heart that recognizes how connected we all are. Loving-kindness is essentially a form of inclusiveness of caring, rather than categorizing others in terms of those whom we care for and those who can be easily excluded, ignored or disdained. Any reduction in our tendency to fall into attachment, aversion or delusion helps refine and expand the force of loving-kindness. A deepening of insight will inevitably include seeing how all of our lives are inextricably interconnected. The diminishing of grasping, aversion and delusion and the increase in insight are both reasons mindfulness naturally leads us to greater loving-kindness.

TI  - Asian Women's Action for Resilience and Empowerment Intervention: Stage I Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the development and pilot test of Asian Women's Action for Resilience and Empowerment (AWARE), a culturally informed group psychotherapy intervention designed to reduce depressive symptoms, suicidality, substance use, and HIV and sexual risk behaviors among 1.5 and second generation Asian American (AA) women. To participate, AA women had to meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or have a history of exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV) as determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ). This article also presents the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of AWARE from its Stage I pilot study of nine Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese American women. To foster holistic treatment, AWARE was developed based on original research findings from Stage 0 and integrated theoretical models including fractured identity theory, empowerment theory, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based techniques, and the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM). The development of AWARE was an iterative process informed by participant feedback, which led to frequent intervention modifications for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Stage II. A qualitative analysis of participant feedback informed the following modifications: further exploration of feelings, improvements in technology delivery, learning and practicing coping skills, more specific cultural tailoring related to sexual health, decreased number of sessions and increased time per session. Findings provide support for the acceptability and feasibility of AWARE as culturally informed for AA young women with IPV histories, high-risk behaviors, and mental health issues.

TI  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) modulates brain-heart connection: An EEG case study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) is an efficient mental practice with a long history that has recently attracted interest in the fields of neuroscience, medicine and education. However, the neural characters and underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully illustrated, which has hindered its practical usefulness. This study aimed to investigate LKM from varied aspects and interactions between the brain, the heart, and psychological measurements. A Buddhist monk practitioner was recruited to complete one 10-min LKM practice, in between two 10-min resting tasks (pre- and post-resting) per experimental run. Two sets of single-channel wearable EEG devices were used to collect EEG data (placed at Fz and Pz) and heart rate simultaneously. A self-report evaluation was conducted to repeatedly record the comprehensive performance of mind and body in each session. EEG data were preprossessed and analyzed by EEGlab. Further statistics were made by SPSS. Spectrum analysis showed a significant increase of theta power (Fz: t = -3.356; p = 0.002; Pz: t = -5.199; p < 0.001) and decrease of heart rate between pre- and post-resting tasks (t = 4.092, p < 0.001). The analysis showed a negative correlation between theta power and heart rate (Fz: r = -0.681, p < 0.001; Pz: r = -0.384, p = 0.008), and a positive correlation between theta power and the self-designed report score (Fz: r = 0.601, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that LKM is accompanied by significant neurophysiological changes, mainly an increase in slower frequencies, such as theta, and a decrease in heart rate. More importantly, subjective psychological assessments were also correlated with objective neurophysiological measurements in a long-term meditator participant. During LKM meditation, this connection was stronger. The results of this case report have promising implications for LKM practice in daily life.

TI  - Metta-Based Therapy for Chronic Depression: a Wait List Control Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Current treatments for chronic depression have focused on reducing interpersonal problems and negative affect, but paid little attention to promoting prosocial motivation and positive affect. Following this treatment focus, the objective of the present study was to examine whether the combination of metta (Loving Kindness) group meditation and subsequent tailored individual therapy focusing on kindness towards oneself and others (metta-based therapy, MBT) shows greater improvements in depressive symptoms than a wait list control group in patients with chronic depression. Methods Forty-eight patients with DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder were randomly assigned to MBT or a wait list control condition. Outcome was assessed after group meditation, after subsequent individual therapy, and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was an independent blind rating of depressive symptoms at post-test. Secondary outcome included changes in self-reported depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, compassion, and clinician-rated emotion regulation. Results Mixed-design analyses showed significant differences between MBT and WLC in changes from pre- to post-test in clinician-rated and self-rated depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, and emotion regulation. Most of the changes occurred during group meditation and were associated with large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions The results provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of MBT in treating chronic depression.

TI  - State Effects of Two Forms of Meditation on Prefrontal EEG Asymmetry in Previously Depressed Individuals.
T2  - Mindfulness
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We investigated state effects of two forms of meditation on electroencephalography prefrontal alpha-asymmetry, a global indicator of approach versus withdrawal motivation and related affective state. A clinical series of previously depressed individuals were guided to practice either mindfulness breathing meditation (N=8) or a form of meditation directly aimed at cultivating positive affect, loving kindness or metta meditation (N=7). Prefrontal asymmetry was assessed directly before and after the 15-min meditation period. Results showed changes in asymmetry towards stronger relative left prefrontal activation, i.e., stronger approach tendencies, regardless of condition. Further explorations of these findings suggested that responses were moderated by participants' tendencies to engage in ruminative brooding. Individuals high in brooding tended to respond to breathing meditation but not loving kindness meditation, while those low in brooding showed the opposite pattern. Comparisons with an additionally recruited "rest" group provided evidence suggesting that changes seen were not simply attributable to habituation. The results indicate that both forms of meditation practice can have beneficial state effects on prefrontal alpha-asymmetry and point towards differential indications for offering them in the treatment of previously depressed patients.

TI  - Sustainable Compassion Training: Integrating Meditation Theory With Psychological Science
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation programs continue to proliferate in the modern world, with increasing participation from scientists and many others who seek to improve physical, mental, relational, and social flourishing. In developing such programs, the meditation practices have been adapted to meet the needs of modern cultures. However, through that adaptation, important contextual factors of traditional contemplative cultures are often dropped or forgotten. This article presents a system of compassion and mindfulness training, Sustainable Compassion Training (SCT), which is designed to help people cultivate increasingly unconditional, inclusive, and sustainable care for self and others. SCT aims to recover important contextual factors of meditation that flexibly meet the diverse needs of modern secular and religious participants. SCT draws on Tibetan Buddhism in dialogue with caregivers, other contemplative traditions and relevant scientific theories to inform meditative transformation for secular contexts. We provide an overview of SCT meditations that includes both contemplative and scientific theories that draw out important features of them. Each meditation includes novel hypotheses that are generated from this dialogical process. We also provide links to audio-guided meditations.

TI  - A meta-analysis and systematic review of the effect of loving-kindness and compassion meditations on negative interpersonal attitudes
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Negative interpersonal attitudes can affect people's well-being, interpersonal relationships, and cooperation. Overcoming negative interpersonal attitudes is a key subject in loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LCMs). However, the results and study design of previous research on negative interpersonal attitudes have been inconsistent. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the effects of LCMs and explore moderators through meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Core Collection, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and PsycINFO databases up to April 2, 2021. Of the 281 identified empirical studies on LCMs, 25 measured negative interpersonal attitudes, and 21 were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the effects of LCMs on negative interpersonal attitudes in daily life were significant both for randomized controlled trials (g = -.203) and uncontrolled trials (g = -.539). The instant effects after meditation were also significant in randomized controlled experiments (g = - .187). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and nonsignificant subgroup analysis showed that the results were robust except for randomized controlled experiments. Although no significant moderators were identified, moderator analysis suggested that reducing bias and sending wishes to difficult targets were especially effective, and LCM subtypes might impact the results. Individual studies found that the contribution of meditation practice during interventions was weak. In sum, LCMs have the potential to reduce negative interpersonal attitudes, especially in multiweek interventions. Future studies should further explore the underlying mechanisms and consider the implications of study design features, such as the induction of negative interpersonal attitudes and the targets of LCMs.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for HIV Treatment Side Effects: A Randomized, Wait-List Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV offer life-extending benefit; however, the side effects associated with ART use negatively impact quality of life and medication adherence among people living with HIV.Objectives. This study tested the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for reducing ART symptoms and bother/distress related to ART side effects. Secondary aims were to test the impact of MBSR on medication adherence and psychological functioning.Methods. Seventy-six people living with HIV who were actively taking ART and reported distress from ART-related side effects were randomly assigned to an MBSR program or a wait-list control (WLC) standard care condition. We measured side effects, ART adherence, perceived stress, depression, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness at three time points: baseline, three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up. Side effects and related distress were assessed separately from other symptoms.Results. Compared with a WLC, participants in the MBSR condition experienced a reduction in the frequency of symptoms attributable to ARTs at three months post-intervention (mean difference = 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.01, 0.66; t(132) - 2.04, P - 0.044) and six months post-intervention (mean difference = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.71; t(132) = 2.27, P = 0.025). MBSR participants also experienced a reduction in distress associated with those symptoms at three months post-intervention (mean difference = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.003, 0.94; t(132) = 1.99, P = 0.048) compared with the WLC condition.Conclusion. MBSR is a promising approach for reducing HIV treatment-related side effects. J Pain Symptom Manage 2012; 43: 161-171. (C) 2012 U. S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Phenomenological Qualitative Exploration of Mind-Body Therapy Use and Effectiveness Among Young, Middle, and Older Adult Cancer Survivors
T2  - INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Having been diagnosed with and treated for cancer can have negative psychosocial repercussions that may differ across the lifespan. Mind-body therapies (MBTs), such as tai-chi/qigong (TCQ) or mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), have shown promise in decreasing negative psychosocial outcomes in cancer survivors, but few studies have explored potential differences in MBT use and effectiveness across age groups.Methods: A descriptive phenomenological qualitative design was used. Participants included young (18-39), middle (40-64), and older (65+) adult cancer survivors who were diagnosed with any type of cancer and had participated in Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) or Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ) MBTs. Semi-structured qualitative interviews explored participants' experiences in MBTs and these were analyzed using descriptive phenomenological analysis.Results: Among the interviews (n = 18), young (n = 6), middle-aged (n = 8), and older (n = 4) adults participated. 5 themes emerged: influences in joining the program, unique lifestyles, positive class experiences, use of media, and program impacts. Though all age groups benefitted from MBT participation, variations between age groups with respect to the benefits received and motivations for joining the program were observed.Discussion: MBTs had beneficial physical and mental health effects on survivors of all age groups. These benefits were particularly connected to the ongoing life stresses common to each age cohort, such as relief from work and family roles for young adults or support during retirement transition for older adults. Hence, access to MBT programs may be beneficial as part of the survivorship plan for patients and the recruitment strategies or content can be adapted by MBT providers to better target and support age-specific groups. More research is required with a larger sample.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Training for Women Veterans With Chronic Pain: A Retrospective Study
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of women veterans experience chronic pain and many have comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To enhance resilience in these veterans in terms of both physical functioning and psychosocial well-being, a mindfulness-based, trauma-informed, eight-session group pilot program was designed to target emotion regulation and social belonging. Women who engaged in treatment were asked to complete questionnaires assessing pain, functioning, and affective and social well-being before and after the program. The present retrospective research study evaluated (a) whether women who engaged in treatment showed pre-to-post treatment improvement in psychosocial and physical functioning and (b) whether women referred to the program who engaged versus did not engage in treatment differed in demographic and clinical data (i.e., pain diagnoses, mental health diagnoses, documented trauma history) obtained from medical record review. The sample consisted of 36 women who began the program and filled out a pregroup questionnaire (intent-to-treat sample; ITT) and 105 women who were referred but did not engage in treatment. The majority had a documented history of trauma, a mood disorder, and a PTSD diagnosis. ITT analyses indicated that veterans showed moderate-to-large pre-post improvements in pain severity, pain catastrophizing, physical functioning, depression, self-compassion, and positive affect. Veterans who engaged in treatment were similar to those who did not in demographics, number of pain diagnoses, and mental health diagnoses, but were more likely to have a documented history of trauma. Despite the limitations of this study, the findings are encouraging and point to the value of a future randomized controlled trial.Impact StatementWomen veterans with chronic pain who participated in a trauma-informed, mindfulness-based training tailored to address their prevalent comorbid trauma, mood disturbance, and social isolation showed substantial improvements in physical and emotional health and credited the program with increasing their pain management options. Tailoring treatment to target the unique challenges faced by women veterans with chronic pain may hold promise for enhancing their resilience and quality of life.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on quality of life in nursing home residents:: A feasibility study
T2  - FORSCHENDE KOMPLEMENTARMEDIZIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With demographic change, the number of elderly people is increasing. The aging process and associated stress diminishes their quality of life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been claimed to reduce stress and alleviate suffering. It might be a useful approach to improve the condition in the elderly. Patients and Methods: To examine feasibility and potential effects of MBSR on nursing home residents in Germany, a non-randomized feasibility study was conducted including 22 participants; 15 of them participated in an 8-week MBSR course, 7 served as untreated comparison group. Health-related quality of life (SF-12), depressive symptoms (GDS-12R), cognitive impairment (MMST), activities of daily living (Barthel Index), satisfaction with life, physical pain and major complaints were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: 9 out of 15 course participants completed the course (60%). They showed a significant increase in the SF-12 physical health score (p = 0.017). Depressive symptoms (GDS-12R) significantly declined within the meditation group (p = 0.04) and as compared to the untreated group (p = 0.011). In the comparison group, a significant decrease in major complaints (p = 0.011) and an increase in the SF-12 mental health score were found. The meditation group yielded positive changes in the SF-12 mental health score, in satisfaction with life and in pain intensity. Conclusions: In view of the setting, the completion rate of 60% appears to be acceptable. Significant results suggest that MBSR may help improve health-related quality of life and reduce symptoms of depression. Yet, as participants did not meet the requirement to practice independently, feasibility of conducting MBSR with elderly who live in a nursing home has to be questioned.

TI  - An Empirical Examination of the Role of Common Factors of Therapy During a Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy Intervention for Headache Pain
T2  - CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:It is often assumed that psychosocial pain treatments work because of specific active components of the intervention. The degree to which common factors may contribute to improved pain outcomes is not well researched. The purpose of this study was to examine patient-related and therapist-related common factors during a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for headache pain trial.Materials and Methods:This study was a secondary analysis of a parallel group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial in which MBCT was compared with a control. A series of linear regression models and 1 bootstrap mediation model were conducted with the sample of participants that completed MBCT (N=21).Results:In-session participant engagement was positively associated with treatment dose indicators of session attendance (P=0.038) and at-home meditation practice (P=0.027). Therapist adherence and quality were both significant predictors of posttreatment client satisfaction (P=0.038 and 0.034, respectively). Therapist appropriateness was not significantly associated with any of the variables of interest (P>0.05). Baseline pain intensity was positively associated with pretreatment expectations and motivations (P=0.049) and working alliance (P=0.048), and working alliance significantly predicted posttreatment patient satisfaction (P<0.001). Higher pretreatment expectations and motivation significantly predicted greater improvement in pretreatment to posttreatment change in pain interference (P=0.016); however, this relation was fully mediated by baseline pain intensity (P<0.05).Discussion:Common factors play an important role in improving pain outcomes and patient satisfaction during a MBCT for headache pain intervention. Stimulating positive pretreatment expectations and patient motivation, as well as building strong rapport is an important component of treatment success.

TI  - Psychotherapy Training Experiences among Four Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Residency Training Centers in Thailand
T2  - Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the differences between psychotherapy training experience, current psychotherapy practice, and confidence in performing various types of psychotherapy among the child and adolescent psychiatrists who graduated from four training centers in Thailand.Materials and Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional descriptive study. A self-reported questionnaire was developed by the authors and sent via mail to all child and adolescent psychiatrists in Thailand. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used for categorical data and continuous data, respectively, to compare the variables between graduates from four training centers. Only data from respondents who graduated within the past 10 years were analyzed.Results: Of 95 respondents (54.0% response rate), 60 respondents finished child and adolescent psychiatry training within the past 10 years. Their average age was 33.6 +/- 3.6 years. Forty-nine (81.7%) of the respondents were female. Duration of child and adolescent psychiatry practice was 3.6 +/- 2.4 years. Twenty-one (35.0%), 19 (31.7%), 18 (30.0%), and two (3.3%) respondents graduated from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, and Yuwaprasart Waithayopathum Hospital, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the frequency of performing Satir Transformational Systemic Therapy [STST) and positive psychology by respondents who graduated from different training centers (p<0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Additionally, there were statistically significant differences in the levels of confidence in performing CBT, STST, Buddhist psychology, Mindfulness -based psychotherapy, and family therapy. Most respondents perceived that psychotherapy training received during residency was inadequate (86.7%), primarily due to inadequate training continuity (70.7%) and inconsistent supervision (65.5%).Conclusion: Psychotherapy training during residency had an important role in influencing the types of psychotherapy practiced post-graduation. The training experiences also had a significant bearing on future confidence in performing psychotherapy.

TI  - Understanding the relationships between teacher mindfulness, work engagement, and classroom emotions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This cross-sectional study investigated the relationships between teacher mindfulness, work engagement, and classroom emotions composed of positive and negative emotions. A sample of 498 Chinese primary, secondary, and high school teachers completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation, and a series of regression equations were conducted to analyze the data. The results indicate that teacher mindfulness, work engagement, and classroom emotions are all at the intermediate level, and significantly correlated. The effect of teacher mindfulness on classroom emotions is partially mediated by work engagement. In addition, negative emotions partially mediate the effect of teacher mindfulness on work engagement, while positive emotions fully mediate it. These results highlight the importance of fostering teacher mindfulness through mindfulness-based intervention, developing teacher emotion regulation competence in teacher education, and cultivating supportive classroom and school culture for teachers to experience more positive emotions from students and administrators.

TI  - Randomized-controlled trial of mindfulness-based cancer recovery versus supportive expressive group therapy among distressed breast cancer survivors (MINDSET): long-term follow-up results
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) and supportive expressive group therapy (SET) are two well-validated psychosocial interventions, but they have not been directly compared, and little is known about long-term outcomes. This comparative effectiveness study measured the effects of these two interventions immediately following the groups and for 1year thereafter in distressed breast cancer survivors.MethodsTwo hundred fifty-two distressed Stage I-III breast cancer survivors were randomized into either MBCR or SET. Women completed questionnaires addressing mood, stress symptoms, quality of life, social support, spirituality and post-traumatic growth before and after the interventions, and 6 and 12months later.ResultsImmediately following the intervention, women in MBCR reported greater reduction in mood disturbance (primarily fatigue, anxiety and confusion) and stress symptoms including tension, sympathetic arousal and cognitive symptoms than those in SET. They also reported increased emotional and functional quality of life, emotional, affective and positive social support, spirituality (feelings of peace and meaning in life) and post-traumatic growth (appreciation for life and ability to see new possibilities) relative to those in SET, who also improved to a lesser degree on many outcomes. Effect sizes of the timexgroup interactions were small to medium, and most benefits were maintained over 12months of follow-up.ConclusionsThis study is the first and largest to demonstrate sustained benefits of MBCR in distressed breast cancer survivors relative to an active control. MBCR was superior to SET for improving psychological well-being with lasting benefits over 1year, suggesting these women gained long-lasting and efficacious tools to cope with cancer.Trial RegistrationRegistered on clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00390169, October 2006.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Age-Well observational, cross-sectional study investigates the affective and cognitive mechanisms of meditation expertise with behavioral, neuroimaging, sleep, and biological measures sensitive to aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).METHODS: Thirty cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 65years or older with at least 10,000hours of practice in mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) are selected. The outcomes are the neuroimaging brain correlates of MM and LKCM and the assessments of long-term meditation practices on behavioral, neural, and biological measures as compared to nonmeditator older controls from the Age-Well randomized controlled trial.RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection began in late 2016 and will be completed by late2019.DISCUSSION: Results are expected to foster the understanding of the effects of meditation expertise on aging and of the mechanisms of action underlying the meditation intervention in the Age-Well randomized controlled trial. These finding will contribute to the design of meditation-based prevention randomized controlled trials for the aged population and to the exploration of the possible long-time developmental trajectory of meditation training.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation and Compassion Meditation: Do They Affect Emotions in a Different Way?
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Despite being often overlapped and used interchangeably in academic literature, loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion meditation (CM) are also seen to have their distinct features. As a differential approach towards LKM and CM can promote a more accurate integration of these practices into the clinical field, it is worth studying their differential effects. The present preregistered study, thus, aimed to experimentally compare effects of single-session LKM and CM on first-time practitioners' emotions. Methods Two hundred and one university students were randomly allocated to three (LKM, CM, and control) groups. The self-reported emotions were measured twice, before and after completing an assigned task. Results Both LKM and CM significantly increased other-focused positive emotions, compared with the control condition. Both LKM and CM increased happiness and overall positive emotions and decreased sadness; however, the effect sizes of LKM were consistently larger compared to those of CM. Both LKM and CM significantly increased low arousal positive emotions, compared with the control condition. Conclusions LKM and CM represent two theoretically different practices. However, as they belong to the same tradition of meditation, they are similar in their intention of forming positive wishes towards self and others, and this appeared to have a positive effect on practitioners' emotional experience. At the same time, LKM was found to be more effective in evoking positive emotions in first-time practitioners, compared with CM.

TI  - The effects of loving-kindness and compassion meditation on life satisfaction: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING
M3  - Review
AB  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) was a promising intervention for improving life satisfaction, but previous findings have been inconsistent. The current study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 23 empirical studies on LKCM with life satisfaction as an outcome variable. The primary meta-analysis indicated that LKCM significantly enhanced life satisfaction in pre-post design (g = 0.312, k = 15, n = 451), but the significance disappeared in the additional meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (g = 0.106, k = 6, n = 404). Moderator analyses found significant effects for type of control (i.e., the effects of LKCM were inferior to active control group, but superior to waitlist condition), but not for other moderators (i.e., participant type, previous meditation experience, specific protocol, components of LKCM, combination with mindfulness mediation, and intervention length). Narrative review identified self-compassion and positive emotions as important mediators. The practice time of LKCM had indirect but not direct association with life satisfaction. The findings supported that LKCM is promising in increasing life satisfaction, but more studies are needed to investigate the effects with more rigorous designs. Future studies should investigate other potential mechanisms and clarify whether LKCM change the reality or the perception of life.

TI  - Methods and Strategies for Reducing Seclusion and Restraint in Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Care
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY
M3  - Review
AB  - Restraints and seclusions are restrictive interventions used in psychiatric inpatient units when there is an imminent risk of harm to the patient or others. Coercive measures are controversial and can lead to negative consequences, including negative emotions, retraumatization, injuries, or death. The article summarizes the last 10 years of literature regarding methods and strategies used for reducing seclusions and restraints in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units, and reports on their outcomes. The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed and PsycInfo for English-language articles published between May 2010 and May 2020. Eighteen articles were found that described methods or strategies aimed at reducing restraint or seclusion utilization in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units. The following interventions were evaluated: Trauma-Informed Care (TIC), Six Core Strategies, Child and Family Centered Care (CFCC), Collaborative & Proactive Solutions (CPS), Strength-Based Care, Modified Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (M-PBIS), Behavioral Modification Program (BMP), Autism Spectrum Disorder Care Pathway (ASD-CP), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), sensory rooms, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training (MBSR) of staff, and Milieu Nurse-Client Shift Assignments. Most of the interventions reduced the use of seclusions and/or restraints. Two child-centered and trauma-informed initiatives eliminated the use of mechanical restraints. This review shows that the use of coercive measures can be reduced and should be prioritized. Successful implementation requires ongoing commitment on all levels of an organization and a willingness to learn. To facilitate comparisons, future models should evaluate different standardized parameters.

TI  - Mystical Love: The Universal Solvent
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors, both anthropologists who study alternative states of consciousness (ASC), explore the psychodynamics of mystical experience (ME). An affect that is a key factor for and integral to the phenomenology of ME is what they term "mystical love." In many respects, ME refers to ASC that is diametrically opposite to everyday ego-centered, materialist consciousness. In this article we examine several questions, including: (1) Why do humans experience ME, (2) why does there seems to be a need to alter consciousness away from ordinary waking states, (3) what is the relationship between mystical love and other affective states such as anger, greed, and anxiety, and (3) what are the necessary conditions for ME-type, transpersonal experiences? We demonstrate that ritual practices are recurrently used across cultures to incubate and evoke intense feelings of non-romantic love, empathy, and compassion. Some of these practices include ritual drivers such as ingesting psychotropic substances (entheogens and empathogens), daily activities that devalue ego centeredness and promote love, empathy and selfless service, meditation upon loving kindness, and compassion. All of these practices are preparations for entering ME, the results of which are interpreted within people's cycle of meaning.

TI  - Caring for Others Cares for the Self: An Experimental Test of Brief Downward Social Comparison, Loving-Kindness, and Interconnectedness Contemplations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several strategies for decreasing anxiety and increasing subjective well-being have been tested and found to be useful, such as downward social comparison, loving-kindness contemplations, and interconnectedness contemplations. These, however, have not often been directly compared. Emerging adults contemplated one technique for 12 min while walking around a building. Those who wished others well (loving-kindness) had lower anxiety, greater happiness, greater empathy, and higher feelings of caring and connectedness than those in a control condition. The Interconnectedness condition resulted only in beneficial effects on social connection. Although social comparison theory suggests that downward social comparison should improve mood, this study found that it had no beneficial effects relative to the control condition and was significantly worse than the loving-kindness condition. This brief loving-kindness contemplation worked equally well across several measured individual differences, and is a simple intervention that can be used to reduce anxiety, increase happiness, empathy, and feelings of social connection.

TI  - Predicting Individual Preferences in Mindfulness Techniques Using Personality Traits
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing popularity of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) has prompted exciting scientific research investigating their beneficial effects on well-being and health. Most mindfulness programs are provided as multi-faceted packages encompassing a set of different mindfulness techniques, each with distinct focus and mechanisms. However, this approach overlooks potential individual differences, which may arise in response to practicing various mindfulness techniques. The present study investigated preferences for four prototypical mindfulness techniques [focused attention (FA), open monitoring (OM), loving-kindness (LK), and body scan (BS)] and identified factors that may contribute to individual differences in these preferences. Participants without prior mindfulness experiences were exposed to each technique through audio-guided instructions and were asked to rank their preferences at the end of all practices. Results indicated that preferences for loving-kindness were predicted by empathy, and that females tended to prefer loving-kindness more than males. Conversely, preferences for open monitoring were predicted by nonreactivity and nonjudgment of present moment experiences. Additionally, higher state mindfulness was detected for individuals' preferred technique relative to other alternatives. These findings suggest that individuals tend to prefer techniques compatible with their personalities, as the predictor variables encompass trait capacities specifically relevant to practicing these techniques. Together, our results suggest the possibility that assessing individual difference and then tailoring MBIs to individual needs could be a useful way to improve intervention effectiveness and subsequent outcomes.

TI  - Feasibility of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program for early-stage breast cancer survivors.
T2  - Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of whether mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has a positive effect on breast cancer survivors' psychological status, psychosocial characteristics, symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) during the critical transition period from end of treatment to resumption of daily activities.DESIGN: Single-group, quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design.METHOD: A sample of 19 women who completed breast cancer treatment with lumpectomy, radiation, and/or chemotherapy was recruited from the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, a National Cancer Institute- designated cancer center, and the University of South Florida. The authors assessed the feasibility, compliance, and whether an 8-week MBSR program positively influenced changes in psychological status (fear of recurrence, perceived stress, anxiety, depression), psychosocial characteristics (optimism, social support, spirituality), physical symptoms, and QOL.FINDINGS: Seventeen women (89.5%) completed the study. The mean age was 57 years; the majority of participants (94%) were White. The estimated compliance rate for the program was 67%. Paired t tests indicated significant improvements fear of recurrence, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and QOL through MBSR participation.CONCLUSIONS: Participants enrolled in the MBSR classes generally were compliant. Significant improvement in psychological status, symptoms, and QOL can be achieved with MBSR use in this population.

TI  - An Initial Examination of State and Longitudinal Effects of Loving-Kindness Practice on Affective and Motivational States at Work
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Drawing on practices and concepts from Buddhist ethics, we developed a loving-kindness training. We investigated the state and longitudinal effects of this training on employees' affective and motivational states at work in two studies. Methods Study 1 tested this training program in a randomized controlled trial, comparing the effects of loving-kindness practice on employee affect and motivation with an active (mindfulness) and a passive (waitlist) control condition. Analyses focused on both longitudinal effects (increases in affect and motivation over the training period) and state effects (effects of practice on daily affect and motivation). Study 2 conducted a 1-week study to further probe the state effects of loving-kindness and the effectiveness of formal vs. informal practice. Results Results indicated mixed support for longitudinal effects, with individuals in the loving-kindness condition showing increases in work motivation, affective valence, and activation over time but the majority of these increases not being statistically different from trends in the two control conditions. Analysis of state (day-level) effects found consistent support for a beneficial effect of loving-kindness practice on daily affective valence and motivation. Analyses from study 2 replicated these day-level effects and provided evidence for the efficacy of both formal and informal practice-based training programs. Conclusions This research provides initial support for the potential benefits of loving-kindness practice in a workplace context. We discuss theoretical and practical implications including the future of loving-kindness practice as a workplace training intervention.

TI  - Mindfulness based stress reduction for medical students: optimising student satisfaction and engagement
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Medical practitioners and students are at increased risk of a number of personal and psychological problems. Stress and anxiety due to work-load and study requirements are common and self-care methods are important in maintaining well-being. The current study examines perceptions of and satisfaction ratings with a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) programme for 1st year (compulsory) and 2nd year (optional) Graduate Entry Medical School students.Methods: A mixed method pre and post study of Year 1 (n = 140) and Year 2 (n = 88) medical students completing a 7 week MBSR course compared student satisfaction ratings. Thematic analysis of feedback from the students on their perception of the course was also carried out.Results: Year 1 students (compulsory course) were less satisfied with content and learning outcomes than Year 2 students (optional course) (p < .0005). Thematic analysis of year 1 student feedback identified themes including great concept, poorly executed; and less discussion, more practice. Year 2 themes included session environment and satisfaction with tutors.Conclusions: The MBSR course was associated with high levels of satisfaction and positive feedback when delivered on an optional basis. Catering for the individual needs of the participant and promoting a safe environment are core elements of a successful self-care programme.

TI  - The effect of mindfulness-based interventions on biomarkers in cancer patients and survivors: A systematic review
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Various reviews and meta-analyses have shown the positive effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on the mental health of cancer patients and survivors. Some studies have also investigated the impact of MBIs on physiological markers of health in oncology, but a systematic review has not been conducted in this field. The current paper aims to fill this gap in the literature. Following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses 2020 guidelines, data were obtained from the databases of Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science in May 2022. Twenty-five studies were included. Globally, 35 biomarkers were employed in these studies and were categorized 8 groups (cortisol; blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and respiratory rate; C-reactive protein; telomere length and telomerase activity (TA); genetic signature; cytokines and hormones; leucocyte activation; leucocyte count and cell subpopulation analysis). In seven of these categories of biomarkers, positive effects of MBIs were observed. The most promising results were obtained for cortisol, BP, TA and pro-inflammatory gene expression. However, the generally low number of studies per single biomarker limits the possibility to draw reliable conclusions. The present review presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art for MBIs in oncology on biomarkers, confirming MBIs' potential for improving physiological health in cancer patients and survivors besides those already shown in literature on psychological well-being.

TI  - Systematic Review for the Medical Applications of Meditation in Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Meditation has been increasingly adapted for healthy populations and participants with diseases. Its beneficial effects are still challenging to determine due to the heterogeneity and methodological obstacles regarding medical applications. This study aimed to integrate the features of therapeutic meditation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs with meditation for populations with diseases using the PubMed database through June 2021. We analyzed the characteristics of the diseases/disorders, participants, measurements, and their overall benefits. Results: Among a total of 4855 references, 104 RCTs were determined and mainly applied mindfulness-based (51 RCTs), yoga-based (32 RCTs), and transcendental meditation (14 RCTs) to 10,139 patient-participants. These RCTs were conducted for participants with a total of 45 kinds of disorders; the most frequent being cancer, followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases and affective mood disorder. Seven symptoms or signs were frequently assessed: depressive mood, feeling anxious, quality of life, stress, sleep, pain, and fatigue. The RCTs showed a higher ratio of positive outcomes for sleep (73.9%) and fatigue (68.4%). Conclusions: This systematic review produced the comprehensive features of RCTs for therapeutic meditation. These results will help physicians and researchers further study clinical adaptations in the future as reference data.

TI  - A Trauma-Adapted Mindfulness and Loving-Kindness Intervention for Patients with PTSD After Interpersonal Violence: a Multiple-Baseline Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate a trauma-adapted intervention for survivors of interpersonal violence that combines psychoeducation and specific mindfulness-based exercises developed for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with formal practices from mindfulness-based stress reduction and loving-kindness meditation. Fourteen patients with PTSD after interpersonal violence participated in eight treatment sessions. The intervention was evaluated in a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline across-individuals design. From baseline (2, 3, and 4weeks, randomly assigned) until 8weeks after the intervention, self-reported PTSD symptoms and well-being were measured on a weekly basis. The intervention was further assessed through self-ratings and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) administered prior to treatment, immediately after treatment and at a 6-week follow-up. Tau-U analyses showed for the majority of the 12 completers a significant reduction of PTSD symptoms and a significant increase in well-being. Furthermore, we found large effects on PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 (Hedges' g=1.66), as well as on depression (Hedges' g=1.08) and psychological distress (Hedges' g=0.85), complemented by relevant increases in mindfulness skills and self-compassion. This study contributes evidence that mindfulness and loving-kindness are useful for reducing PTSD in victims of interpersonal violence, especially when the intervention is tailored to the specific needs of these patients.

TI  - Flow Meditation Improves Emotion Regulation and Pain Management in Female Fibromyalgia Patients
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a multifaceted psychosomatic pain condition associated with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression, anxiety, emotional stress, and coping problems. Negative cognitions and difficulties in emotional regulation can increase and amplify pain. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention known as Flow Meditation (Meditacion-Fluir) on different variables (i.e., catastrophizing, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence) related to emotion regulation and pain management in individuals with FMS.Methods: Forty-four women diagnosed with fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to a 7-week Flow Meditation group intervention (intervention group; n = 22) or waiting-list control group (n = 22). Measures were taken at three different times: pretest, post-test, and 3-month follow-up.Results: Findings revealed significant improvements in pain catastrophizing (rumination, magnification, and helplessness), adaptive coping strategies (active versus passive), and emotional intelligence, which were maintained until the 3-month follow-up assessment. Effect sizes range from moderate to high, most notably for the Rumination and Despair components of pain catastrophizing, and for emotional intelligence.Conclusions: Flow Meditation shows promise for alleviating negative distorted thinking and improving adaptive coping as part of pain management in female fibromyalgia patients.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study investigated the effects of a short video-app-guided loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on affect, oneness belief, and proenvironmenal behavior. Methods: We recruited 93 college students from a university in China and randomized them to an LKM group (n = 47) and a wait-list control group (n = 46). The app-group engaged in an 8-week LKM intervention, while the wait-list control group underwent no intervention. We measured five major variable factors (positive affect, negative affect, oneness belief, and proenvironmenal behavior) before and after the LKM intervention. Results: In the app-group, oneness belief, positive affect, and proenvironmenal behavior were significantly higher and negative affect was significantly lower than in the wait-list control group. The wait-list control group displayed no noticeable differences in any of the four variants[variables??] between the pretest and posttest. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the short video-app-guided LKM may help to improve oneness belief, positive affect, proenvironmenal behavior and reduce negative affect. The finding of the short video-app-guided LKM's effect extends our understanding of the integrative effects of positive psychology and digital media on proenvironmenal behavior.

TI  - Psychological interventions for people with Parkinson's disease in the early 2020s: Where do we stand?
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To explore the heterogeneity of the literature on psychological interventions for psychological difficulties in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).Methods A scoping review was performed across five major databases (MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Academic Search Ultimate, and Cochrane Library) up to June 2020.Results From an initial return of 4911 citations, 56 studies were included, of which 21 were RCTs. A relatively wide range of therapeutic models have been adopted with people with PD, from common therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, to less frequent approaches, for example, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and psychodrama. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed, and suggestions are provided for future research on intervention studies and key psychological outcomes.Conclusions CBT appears to be effective in treating depression and sleep disorders in people with PD, while psychoeducation programmes alone should be avoided. The use of CBT to improve anxiety, quality of life, and impulse control, as well mindfulness-based interventions, should be undertaken with some caution because of insufficient research and inconsistent results. As we enter the new decade, more high-quality evidence is required for psychological interventions in people with PD in general and to corroborate preliminary positive findings on the adoption of less frequent approaches such as ACT.Practitioner pointsParkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with several psychological difficulties which be targeted by psychological interventions.Currently, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be recommended to treat depression and sleep disorders in people with Parkinson's, while psychoeducation alone should be avoided.Caution is advised regarding the use of CBT and mindfulness-based interventions to improve anxiety, quality of life, and impulse control.Further evidence is required for less common approaches, such as acceptance and commitment therapy, psychodrama, and EMDR.

TI  - Measuring the Immeasurables: Development and Initial Validation of the Self-Other Four Immeasurables (SOFI) Scale Based on Buddhist Teachings on Loving Kindness, Compassion, Joy, and Equanimity
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple measures exist that examine the attentional aspects of meditation practice, but measurement of the compassion component is relatively understudied. This paper describes the development and initial validation of a scale designed to measure application of the four immeasurable qualities at the heart of Buddhist teachings: loving kindness, compassion, joy and acceptance toward both self and others. Our analyses suggest four distinct subscales: positive qualities toward self, positive qualities toward others, negative qualities toward self and negative qualities toward others. Initial examination of reliability and validity showed high internal consistency for the subscales as well as strong concurrent, discriminant, and construct validity. We believe the Self-Other Four Immeasurables (SOFI) scale has broad utility for research on mindfulness, positive psychology, and social psychology.

TI  - Implications for a mindfulness-enhanced positive affect induction: A brief commentary toward acute pain management
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Over the past decade research has increased on dynamics between mindfulness, positive affect, and pain. While there have been studies examining the direct use of positive psychology for pain management, few have examined the use of a specific mindfulness-enhanced positive affect induction (i.e. a singular brief technique engendering mindfulness and strong positive affect) toward acute pain and pain flare management. This topical commentary discusses the need for such a technique toward bolstered gold-standard interventions, related studies, and possible future directions for acute and post-surgical pain management. Future research is encouraged to build from prior research on loving-kindness meditation and examine novel, brief mindfulness-enhanced positive affect inductions for acute pain management.

TI  - Resilience after adversity: an umbrella review of adversity protective factors and resilience-promoting interventions.
T2  - Frontiers in psychiatry
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - Introduction: Resilience is the dynamic adaptive process of maintaining or recovering mental health from stressors, such as trauma, challenging life circumstances, critical transitions, or physical illnesses. Resilience after adversity can be fostered through protective factors and the implementation of interventions that promote resilience. Hence, it is essential to investigate both protective and vulnerable factors to reduce the negative effects of unfavorable life events and increase resilience through positive risk-response interventions.Objective: To assess the effect of previous adversity, protecting factors, and resilience-promoting interventions to possess resilience after adversity in a global context.Methods: The study included English language articles sourced from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sciences, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Google Scholar published before 15 April 2024. These articles reported the effect of adversity, protecting factors, and/or resilience-promoting interventions to possess resilience after adversity in a global context without a population age limitation. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews. A weighted inverse-variance random-effects model was applied to find the pooled estimates. The subgroup analysis, heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis were also assessed.Results: A total of 44 articles (n = 556,920 participants) were included in this umbrella review. From the random-effects model analysis, the pooled effect of adversity on the development of resilience was 0.25 (p < 0.001). The pooled effects of adversity-protective factors and resilience-promoting interventions after adversity were 0.31 (p < 0.001) and 0.42 (p < 0.001), respectively. The pooled effects of specific adversity protective factors were 0.26, 0.09, 0.05, 0.34, 0.23, and 0.43 for the availability of support, cognitive ability, community cohesion, positive self-perception, religious involvement, and self-regulation, respectively. The pooled effects of specific resilience-promoting interventions were 0.30, 0.21, 0.51, and 0.52 for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, mixed interventions, and resilience-promoting interventions, respectively.Conclusion: The findings of this umbrella review revealed that people who experienced early adversity can develop resilience later in life. The study highlights the need to consider adversity protective factors, such as availability of support (family, friends, and school), cognitive ability, community cohesion, positive self-perception, religious involvement, and self-regulation, and resilience-promoting interventions, including CBT interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, and mixed interventions, to enhance resilience promotion programs.

TI  - Needs and Preferences for Remote-Delivered Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Patients After Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Qualitative Study
T2  - GLOBAL ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFollowing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), up to 40% of patients report elevated depressive symptoms which is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality risk due to behavioral and biological mechanisms. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) delivered via synchronous group videoconferencing could help reduce depressive symptoms.ObjectiveTo guide MBCT adaptation for ACS patients for a future clinical trial, this qualitative study aimed to explore ACS patients' (1) symptoms after ACS, (2) needs for behavioral health treatment, (3) perspectives on mindfulness intervention and group videoconference delivery, and (4) willingness to self-collect dried blood spots in a research study.MethodsWe compared ACS patients with and without depressive symptoms to highlight particularly relevant treatment topics for patients developing depression following ACS experience. From 2/2019-11/2019, we conducted semi-structured individual telephone interviews with N = 23 patients after ACS (N = 13 with and N = 10 without elevated depressive symptoms; 63.4 (SD = 8.5) years, 87% male, 96% non-Hispanic white, 7.1 (SD = 7.5) years since ACS). In qualitative content analyses, four independent coders coded each interview.ResultsParticipants with depressive symptoms experienced emotional, physical, social, and health behavior problems, while those without depressive symptoms made positive health behavior changes and struggled with anxiety symptoms. Both groups were interested in a behavioral health treatment for emotional and social support. Most were willing to participate in a mindfulness group via videoconferencing; some preferred in-person, but accessibility and convenience outweighed these cons. Almost all were willing to self-collect dried blood spots and some were already familiar with this technique.ConclusionACS patients, especially those with depressive symptoms, need help managing a multitude of quality of life concerns that can be targeted with an adapted MBCT approach. A videoconference-delivered MBCT approach is of interest. Suggestions for adapting MBCT to target the needs of ACS patients are discussed.

AB  - Background: The psychological health of a pregnant woman and a healthy fetal relationship are important for perinatal adaptation. This study aimed to develop loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM), which are known to be effective for improving interpersonal relationships and to verify its effectiveness in order to promote maternal-fetal attachment (MFA).Methods: We developed an LKCM curriculum and training program for pregnant women and assessed its efficacy for improving MFA, positive emotion, mindfulness, and positive fetal movement experience (PFME) through a pre-intervention, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up comparison with a yoga comparison group and an untreated control group.Results: The LKCM experimental group showed significantly improved MFA, positive emotion, mindfulness, and PFME than did the other groups at post-intervention and follow-up.Conclusions: Overall, this study confirmed that LKCM interventions can promote MFA, positive emotions, mindfulness, and PFME. Thus, it is meaningful that this study served to foster beneficial psychological resources compared to numerous studies aiming to improve deficits experienced by pregnant women.Additionally, this is the first full-scale study to develop a program based on specialized LKCM to enhance MFA during pregnancy and verify its efficacy.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation Promotes Mental Health in University Students
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has been shown to improve wellbeing and positive emotions in clinical and non-clinical populations. The main goal of the present study was to examine whether LKM might be an effective intervention to promote positive mental health using the Positive Mental Health Scale (PMH) and to decrease depression, anxiety, and stress in university students. Methods The sample (n = 110) consisted of university students in Germany. One half of them (n = 55) underwent LKM intervention. They were compared with a matched control group (n = 55) which did not receive treatment. All participants completed positive and negative mental health measures at baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments. LKM participants additionally completed the same measures before and after treatment. Multiple analyses of variance were conducted to test for short- and long-term effects of LKM on positive and negative mental health measures. Results A significant short-term effect of LKM on anxiety and PMH was found. Long-term analyses revealed a significant decrease of depression, anxiety, and stress for LKM completers, and a significant increase of depression, anxiety, and stress for the control group. Conclusions The results suggest that LKM enhances mental health in university students.

T2  - Designing Loving-Kindness Meditation in Virtual Reality for Long-Distance Romantic Relationships [arXiv]
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is used in clinical psychology for couples' relationship therapy, but physical isolation can make the relationship more strained and inaccessible to LKM. Virtual reality (VR) can provide immersive LKM activities for long-distance couples. However, no suitable commercial VR applications for couples exist to engage in LKM activities of long-distance. This paper organized a series of workshops with couples to build a prototype of a couple-preferred LKM app. Through analysis of participants' design works and semi-structured interviews, we derived design considerations for such VR apps and created a prototype for couples to experience. We conducted a study with couples to understand their experiences of performing LKM using the VR prototype and a traditional video conferencing tool. Results show that LKM session utilizing both tools has a positive effect on the intimate relationship and the VR prototype is a more preferable tool for long-term use. We believe our experience can inform future researchers.

TI  - Burnout among physicians.
T2  - The Libyan journal of medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Burnout is a common syndrome seen in healthcare workers, particularly physicians who are exposed to a high level of stress at work; it includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Burnout among physicians has garnered significant attention because of the negative impact it renders on patient care and medical personnel. Physicians who had high burnout levels reportedly committed more medical errors. Stress management programs that range from relaxation to cognitive-behavioral and patient-centered therapy have been found to be of utmost significance when it comes to preventing and treating burnout. However, evidence is insufficient to support that stress management programs can help reducing job-related stress beyond the intervention period, and similarly mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions efficiently reduce psychological distress and negative vibes, and encourage empathy while significantly enhancing physicians' quality of life. On the other hand, a few small studies have suggested that Balint sessions can have a promising positive effect in preventing burnout; moreover exercises can reduce anxiety levels and exhaustion symptoms while improving the mental and physical well-being of healthcare workers. Occupational interventions in the work settings can also improve the emotional and work-induced exhaustion. Combining both individual and organizational interventions can have a good impact in reducing burnout scores among physicians; therefore, multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the work environmental factors along with stress management programs that teach people how to cope better with stressful events showed promising solutions to manage burnout. However, until now there have been no rigorous studies to prove this. More interventional research targeting medical students, residents, and practicing physicians are needed in order to improve psychological well-being, professional careers, as well as the quality of care provided to patients.

AB  - In two studies using samples representative of the US adult population with regard to age, sex and ethnicity, we investigated relationships between loving-kindness and compassion-based practices with speciesism, animal solidarity and desire to help animals. In a cross-sectional study (Study 1, N = 2,822), results showed that past 30 days practice and estimated lifetime number of hours of lovingkindness or compassion meditation were associated with more animal solidarity and greater desire to help animals. Past 30 days practice was also associated with less speciesism, but only when adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. In an experimental study (Study 2, N = 1,102), results showed that participants randomized to a befriending meditation (a practice similar to loving-kindness and compassion meditation) condition scored higher on animal solidarity and desire to help animals than participants randomized to a control condition. No significant difference was observed on speciesism, but mediation analyses suggested that effects on all three outcomes were mediated through perceived commonality with animals.

T2  - SPECIAL ISSUE: ADVANCES IN MEDITATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The brain is the central organ for adaptation to experiences, including stressors, which are capable of changing brain architecture as well as altering systemic function through neuroendocrine, autonomic, immune, and metabolic systems. Because the brain is the master regulator of these systems, as well as of behavior, alterations in brain function by chronic stress can have direct and indirect effects on cumulative allostatic overload, which refers to the cost of adaptation. There is much new knowledge on the neural control of systemic physiology and the feedback actions of physiologic mediators on brain regions regulating higher cognitive function, emotional regulation, and self-regulation. The healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience, based upon its ability to respond to interventions designed to open "windows of plasticity" and redirect its function toward better health. As a result, plasticity-facilitating treatments should be given within the framework of a positive behavioral intervention; negative experiences during this window may even make matters worse. Indeed, there are no magic bullets and drugs cannot substitute for targeted interventions that help an individual become resilient, of which mindfulness-based stress reduction and meditation are emerging as useful tools.

TI  - Modulating affective experience and emotional intelligence with loving kindness meditation and transcranial direct current stimulation: A pilot study
T2  - SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Positive emotional perceptions and healthy emotional intelligence (EI) are important for social functioning. In this study, we investigated whether loving kindness meditation (LKM) combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would facilitate improvements in EI and changes in affective experience of visual stimuli. LKM has been shown to increase positive emotional experiences and we hypothesized that tDCS could enhance these effects. Eighty-seven undergraduates were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of LKM or a relaxation control recording with anodal tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left dlPFC) or right temporoparietal junction (right TPJ) at 0.1 or 2.0 milliamps. The primary outcomes were self-reported affect ratings of images from the International Affective Picture System and EI as measured by the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Results indicated no effects of training on EI, and no main effects of LKM, electrode placement, or tDCS current strength on affect ratings. There was a significant interaction of electrode placement by meditation condition (p = 0.001), such that those assigned to LKM and right TPJ tDCS, regardless of current strength, rated neutral and positive images more positively after training. Results suggest that LKM may enhance positive affective experience.

TI  - Distinct Neural Activity Associated with Focused-Attention Meditation and Loving-Kindness Meditation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the dissociable neural effects of anapanasati (focused-attention meditation, FAM) and metta (loving-kindness meditation, LKM) on BOLD signals during cognitive (continuous performance test, CPT) and affective (emotion-processing task, EPT, in which participants viewed affective pictures) processing. Twenty-two male Chinese expert meditators (11 FAM experts, 11 LKM experts) and 22 male Chinese novice meditators (11 FAM novices, 11 LKM novices) had their brain activity monitored by a 3T MRI scanner while performing the cognitive and affective tasks in both meditation and baseline states. We examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and expertise (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a conjunction approach to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert meditative state. Additionally, exclusive masking techniques revealed distinct interactions between state and group during LKM and FAM. Specifically, we demonstrated that the practice of FAM was associated with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural activation differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of state LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance. On the other hand, both FAM and LKM practice appeared to affect the neural responses to affective pictures. For viewing sad faces, the regions activated for FAM practitioners were consistent with attention-related processing; whereas responses of LKM experts to sad pictures were more in line with differentiating emotional contagion from compassion/emotional regulation processes. Our findings provide the first report of distinct neural activity associated with forms of meditation during sustained attention and emotion processing.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a Buddhist Generosity Scale to assess Buddhist generosity, acts of compassion to give something of value to humans and animals, among Thai Buddhists. Conceptually the Scale consists of two factors: scope giving to humans and animals, and criticality-the gifts' importance to the recipients. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the two-factor structure. Convergent validity tests showed its relationships with optimism, hope, and altruism but none with forgiveness; discriminant validity tests found positive relationship with psychological entitlement but none with trait anger and greed. Results of the predictive validity test showed that Buddhist generosity mediated the relationship between loving kindness and happiness. The scale is valid for use to assess Buddhist generosity in countries where Theravada Buddhism is practiced. The relationships between good thought (loving kindness) and good deed (Buddhist generosity) and good result (happiness) support the Buddhist law of human behaviors (kamma).

TI  - Findings From a Provider-Led, Mindfulness-Based, Internet-Streamed Yoga Video Addressing the Psychological Outcomes of Breast Cancer Survivors
T2  - HOLISTIC NURSING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the psychological outcomes of a mindfulness-based Internet-streamed yoga video in breast cancer survivors. A one-group, repeated-measures, purposive sample using a directed qualitative descriptive and convergent mixed-methods approach was used. Participants were recruited from breast oncology practices across 2 settings in the northeastern United States in April 2019. Education about the video was provided, and the link to the video was sent to participants. Demographic information, Knowing Participation in Change Short Form (KPCSF), Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), and the Generalized Anxiety Distress Scale (GAD-7) were obtained at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks. A semistructured interview was conducted at 4 weeks. Thirty-five women (mean age = 56 years) participated. A one-group, repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated statistically significant changes occurred in all measures between week 0 and week 4: decreased GAD (t = -2.97, P = .004), improved WEMWBS (t = 2.52, P = .008), and increased KPC (t = 2.99, P = .004). Qualitative findings suggest the overall experience of the video was positive and the women would recommend its use to others. Improvements in all psychological measures were achieved with video use. Findings indicate an improvement in psychological measures and support the theory of Knowing Participation in Change. This work further contributes to accessible, flexible interventions available through the Internet and/or mobile applications aimed at improving breast cancer survivorship.

TI  - Burnout among physicians.
T2  - The Libyan journal of medicine
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Burnout is a common syndrome seen in healthcare workers, particularly physicians who are exposed to a high level of stress at work; it includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Burnout among physicians has garnered significant attention because of the negative impact it renders on patient care and medical personnel. Physicians who had high burnout levels reportedly committed more medical errors. Stress management programs that range from relaxation to cognitive-behavioral and patient-centered therapy have been found to be of utmost significance when it comes to preventing and treating burnout. However, evidence is insufficient to support that stress management programs can help reducing job-related stress beyond the intervention period, and similarly mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions efficiently reduce psychological distress and negative vibes, and encourage empathy while significantly enhancing physicians' quality of life. On the other hand, a few small studies have suggested that Balint sessions can have a promising positive effect in preventing burnout; moreover exercises can reduce anxiety levels and exhaustion symptoms while improving the mental and physical well-being of healthcare workers. Occupational interventions in the work settings can also improve the emotional and work-induced exhaustion. Combining both individual and organizational interventions can have a good impact in reducing burnout scores among physicians; therefore, multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the work environmental factors along with stress management programs that teach people how to cope better with stressful events showed promising solutions to manage burnout. However, until now there have been no rigorous studies to prove this. More interventional research targeting medical students, residents, and practicing physicians are needed in order to improve psychological well-being, professional careers, as well as the quality of care provided to patients.

TI  - Psychological and Physiological Effects of Compassionate Mind Training: a Pilot Randomised Controlled Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of the compassionate self, associated with practices such as slow and deeper breathing, compassionate voice tones and facial expressions and compassionate focusing, is central to Compassion-Focused Therapy. This study explores the impact of a 2-week compassionate mind training (CMT) program on emotional, self-evaluative and psychopathology measures and on heart rate variability (HRV). Participants (general population and college students) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: CMT (n = 56) and wait-list control (n = 37). Participants in the CMT condition were instructed to practice CMT exercises during 2 weeks. Self-report measures of compassion, positive affect, fears of compassion, self-criticism, shame, depression, anxiety and stress and HRV were collected at pre- and post-interventions in both conditions. Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed significant increases in positive emotions, associated with feeling relaxed and also safe and content, but not activated, and in self-compassion, compassion for others and compassion from others. There were significant reductions in shame, self-criticism, fears of compassion and stress. Only the experimental group reported significant improvement in HRV. Developing awareness of the evolved nature and inherent difficulties of our minds allied with practicing CMT exercises has beneficial effects on participants' psychological and physiological well-being.

TI  - Upper secondary school students' compliance with two Internet-based self-help programmes: a randomised controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychiatric symptoms and stress are on the increase among Swedish adolescents. We aimed to study the potential effect and feasibility of two Internet-based self-help programmes, one mindfulness based (iMBI) and the other music based in a randomised controlled trial that targeted adolescents. A total of 283 upper secondary school students in two Swedish schools were randomised to either a waiting list or one of the two programmes, on their own incentive, on schooltime. General psychiatric health (Symptoms Checklist 90), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were assessed before and after the interventions. In total, 202 participants answered the questionnaires. Less than 20 logged into each intervention and only 1 performed a full intervention (iMBI). No significant differences in any of the scales were found between those who logged in and those who did not. The potential effect of Internet-based self-help programmes was not possible to examine due to low compliance rates. Adolescents seem to have a very low compliance with Internet-based self-help programmes if left to their own incentive. There were no associations between the psychiatric and stress-related symptoms at baseline and compliance in any of the intervention groups, and no evidence for differences in compliance in relation to the type of programme. Additional studies are needed to examine how compliance rates can be increased in Internet-based self-help mindfulness programmes in adolescents, as the potentially positive effects of mindfulness are partly related to compliance rates.

TI  - Outcome Expectancies, Effects, and Mechanisms of Brief Training in Mindfulness Meditation vs. Loving-Kindness Meditation vs a Control Condition for Pain Management: A Randomized Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN & PALLIATIVE CARE PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study investigated the analgesic effects of a single session of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) relative to a control. A total of 100 adults with chronic or current problematic pain completed a survey and were randomized to a 20-minute MM, LKM, or audiobook control. Co-primary outcomes of pain intensity and unpleasantness and mediators of mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed pre- and posttraining. Expectancies were assessed pretraining. Pain type (chronic vs current problematic) was a covariate. Relative to the control, higher expectancies were reported for MM and LKM (P < .001). MM (d = 0.41, P = .032) and LKM (d = 0.38, P = .027) had medium effects on pain intensity, with greater decreases than control (d = 0.05, P = .768). All conditions had small effects on unpleasantness. Mindful observing increased more within MM (d = 0.52, P = .022) and the control (d = 0.50, P = .011) than LKM (d = 0.12, P = .50); self-compassion increased more in LKM (d = 0.36, P = .042) than MM (d = 0.27, P = .201) and the control (d = 0.22, P = .249). The mediation models were nonsignificant. Pain type was a nonsignificant covariate. Overall, MM and LKM were associated with positive expectancies and small-medium pain intensity reductions, which did not differ by pain type. Although MM and LKM were associated with changes in theorized mediators, these changes did not underlie improvement.

TI  - Lectio Divina for Trauma Symptoms: A Two-Part Study
T2  - SPIRITUALITY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this two-part study, we attempted to accomplish two major tasks. In Study 1, with an online sample of Christian-identifying trauma survivors (N = 257), we aimed to empirically investigate our theoretical model, anchored to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. This theoretical model suggests that negative affect mediates the relationship between Christian contentment and Christian gratitude and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other posttrauma symptoms. Based on this theoretical model, in Study 2, with a separate online sample of Christian-identifying trauma survivors (N = 26), we tested an original, online, 2-week program. Specifically, we examined the potential impact that a Christian meditative intervention, lectio divina (Latin for "divine reading"), has on increasing Christian contentment and Christian gratitude and decreasing PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms. Study 1 results revealed that negative affect mediated the relationship between Christian contentment (but not Christian gratitude) and PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms. Study 2 results suggested that, pre- to postintervention, the lectio divina group (n = 13) reported a greater decrease in PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms than the loving-kindness meditation control group (n = 13). These results are discussed in the context of both the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions and a growing literature on Christian-sensitive meditative alternatives to Buddhist-influenced mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation for psychological symptoms. Directions for future research and study limitations are also discussed.

T2  - BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe study investigated the effects of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on doctors' communication anxiety, trust, calling, and defensive medicine practice.MethodsThis study recruited 94 doctors from a hospital in China, randomized them to an LKM group (n = 47), and waited for the control group (n = 47). The experimental group accepted an 8-week LKM interference while the waiting for the control group underwent no interference. Researchers measured four major variable factors (communication anxiety, trust, calling, and defensive medicine practice) before and after the LKM intervention.ResultsIn the experimental group, trust, and calling were significantly higher, and communication anxiety, and defensive medicine practice were significantly lower than in the control group. In the control group, there were no noticeable differences in any of the four variables between the pre-test and post-test.ConclusionsThe results of this study demonstrate that LKM may help to improve trust, and calling, and reduce communication anxiety and defensive medicine practice. The finding of LKM's effect extends the understanding of the integrative effects of positive psychology on the decrease of defensive medicine practice.Trial registrationChiCTR2300074568.

TI  - Effects of a mindfulness based childbirth and parenting program on pregnant women's perceived stress and risk of perinatal depression-Results from a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting Program (MBCP) in reducing pregnant women's perceived stress and preventing perinatal depression compared to an active control condition.Method: First time pregnant women (n = 197) at risk of perinatal depression were randomized to MBCP or an active control treatment, which consisted of a Lamaze childbirth class. At baseline and post-intervention, participants filled out questionnaires on perceived stress, depressive symptoms, positive states of mind, and five facets of mindfulness.Results: Compared to the active control treatment, MBCP significantly reduced perceived stress (p = 0.038, d = 0.30) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.004, d = 0.42), and increased positive states of mind (p = 0.005, d = 0.41) and self-reported mindfulness (p = 0.039, d = 0.30). Moreover, change in mindfulness possibly mediated the treatment effects of MBCP on stress, depression symptoms, and positive states of mind. The subscales "non-reactivity to inner experience" and "non-judging of experience" seemed to have the strongest mediating effects.Limitations: The outcomes were self-report questionnaires, the participants were not blinded to treatment condition and the condition was confounded by number of sessions.Conclusions: Our results suggest that MBCP is more effective in decreasing perceived stress and risk of perinatal depression compared to a Lamaze childbirth class. The results also contribute to our understanding of the underlying psychological mechanisms through which the reduction of stress and depression symptoms may operate. Thus, this study increases our knowledge about efficient intervention strategies to prevent perinatal depression and promote mental wellbeing among pregnant women.

TI  - Exploring Buddhism as a 'Tool' to Support Well-Being: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of Western Adopters' Experiences
T2  - PASTORAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Buddhism is an ancient religion and philosophy of living that is practised worldwide. More recent interest in mindfulness as a practice and intervention in the West has highlighted Buddhist-derived concepts as useful in supporting health and well-being. As a result, the desire to understand Buddhism in its more complete form has strengthened. Although research into mindfulness and compassion is growing, there is a new interest in second-generation mindfulness, i.e. interventions that draw upon a more holistic use of Buddhist practices. To date, little research has explored this in Western contexts. For the current study, Nichiren Buddhists from the United Kingdom who had been practising for at least three years were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore their experience of this practice and how it informed their approach to daily life and, in particular, their health and well-being. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was employed as a method to understand the participants' experiences. Three themes were generated using an inductive approach: (1) finding meaning-"All experiences have got so much value now"- which reflected the participants' determination to seek purpose and value in all aspects of their life; (2) Buddhism as a needed 'tool'-"I use it all the time"-which revealed their practice as an important method to help them manage their lives; and (3) agency-"I'm in control of my destiny"-which highlighted the participants' engagement (supported by their Buddhist practice) in taking responsibility for their actions and responses. Findings indicate the need for future studies to further explore Buddhism as a mechanism for enhancing and sustaining well-being.

TI  - Mindfulness and Behavior Change
T2  - HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Initiating and maintaining behavior change is key to the prevention and treatment of most preventable chronic medical and psychiatric illnesses. The cultivation of mindfulness, involving acceptance and nonjudgment of present-moment experience, often results in transformative health behavior change. Neural systems involved in motivation and learning have an important role to play. A theoretical model of mindfulness that integrates these mechanisms with the cognitive, emotional, and self-related processes commonly described, while applying an integrated model to health behavior change, is needed. This integrative review (1) defines mindfulness and describes the mindfulness-based intervention movement, (2) synthesizes the neuroscience of mindfulness and integrates motivation and learning mechanisms within a mindful self-regulation model for understanding the complex effects of mindfulness on behavior change, and (3) synthesizes current clinical research evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions targeting health behaviors relevant to psychiatric care. The review provides insight into the limitations of current research and proposes potential mechanisms to be tested in future research and targeted in clinical practice to enhance the impact of mindfulness on behavior change.

AB  - Objective: Kindness-based meditation (KBM) is a rubric covering meditation techniques developed to elicit kindness in a conscious way. Some techniques, for example, loving-kindness meditation and compassion meditation, have been included in programs aimed at improving health and well-being. Our aim was to systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of KBM on health and well-being against passive and active control groups in patients and the general population. Method: Searches were completed in March 2013. Two reviewers applied predetermined eligibility criteria (RCTs, peer-reviewed publications, theses or conference proceedings, adult participants, KBM interventions) and extracted the data. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Results: Twenty-two studies were included. KBM was moderately effective in decreasing self-reported depression (standard mean difference [Hedges's g] = -0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.08, -0.14]) and increasing mindfulness (Hedges's g = 0.63, 95% CI [0.22, 1.05]), compassion (Hedges's g = 0.61, 95% CI [0.24, 0.99]) and self-compassion (Hedges's g = 0.45, 95% CI [0.15, 0.75]) against passive controls. Positive emotions were increased (Hedges's g = 0.42, 95% CI [0.10, 0.75]) against progressive relaxation. Exposure to KBM may initially be challenging for some people. Results were inconclusive for some outcomes, in particular against active controls. The methodological quality of the reports was low to moderate. Results suffered from imprecision due to wide CIs deriving from small studies. Conclusions: KBM showed evidence of benefits for the health of individuals and communities through its effects on well-being and social interaction. Further research including well-conducted large RCTs is warranted.

TI  - The Self-Compassion Scale is Not Validated in a Buddhist Sample
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of self-compassion originated from Buddhism, but very little is known about the utility and functions of this concept among Buddhists. Four hundred and eleven individuals (179 Buddhists and 232 non-Buddhists) completed the survey packages using the self-compassion scale (SCS; Neff in Self Identity 2(3):223-250, 2003a. doi:10.1080/15298860309027). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the original six dimensions of the SCS were not replicated by both samples, and further analysis of the intra-correlations within dimensions of SCS and relationships between SCS and other variables showed unexpected results specific to Buddhists. Among Buddhists, the dimensions of self-kindness and common humanity neither showed negative correlations with their opposite dimensions nor were associated with better emotional outcomes. In addition, these two dimensions were not predicted by the regular practice of loving-kindness meditation. This study argued that the ideas of self-compassion reflected in the SCS are theoretically different from the ideas of Buddhism, and further implications for measuring and clinically applying self-compassion were discussed.

TI  - An Integrative Theory-Driven Positive Emotion Regulation Intervention
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past fifteen years, positive psychology research has validated a set of happiness enhancing techniques. These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program -PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls. Our results suggest that the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation can be an effective option to organize and deliver positive integrative interventions.

TI  - The Acceptability, Feasibility and Potential Outcomes of an Individual Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Hearing Voices
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A prominent area of advancement in the psychological treatment for people with persisting psychosis has been the application of mindfulness-based therapies. Recent literature has recommended the investigation of focused mindfulness interventions for voices (auditory hallucinations) as a specific experience. To date, only mindfulness programs in group format have been examined. Aims: This non-randomized pilot study aimed to assess the acceptability, feasibility and potential outcomes of an individual mindfulness program for persistent voices on the negative impact of voices on the subjective experience of mental health and wellbeing, depression and voice-related distress and disruption. Also, it aimed to identify potential psychological and neurocognitive mechanisms of change. Method: A new 4-week individual Mindfulness Program for Voices (iMPV) was developed, and piloted with a group of 14 participants with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and persisting voices. Participants completed clinical and neurocognitive measures pre- and post-intervention and at 2-month follow-up. Results: Results revealed low attrition rates, high formal practice engagement levels and positive participant feedback. Pre-post outcomes suggested small to moderate effects for a reduction in the negative impact of voices on experience, depression and disruption. Large effects for changes in mindful responding and attentional switching were also identified. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that this novel treatment protocol is appropriate, engaging and safe for persistent voice hearers. Findings for mindful responding and attentional switching suggest these to be potential mechanisms of change for further investigation. Further RCTs are warranted to ascertain the feasibility and efficacy for focused mindfulness interventions for voices of individual format.

TI  - Effect of Mindfulness Versus Loving-kindness Training on Leukocyte Gene Expression in Midlife Adults Raised in Low-Socioeconomic Status Households
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives People raised in low-socioeconomic status (SES) households are at an increased risk for physical illness in adulthood. A shift in gene expression profiles in the immune system is one biological mechanism thought to account for elevated disease susceptibility, with a frequently investigated profile being the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral and antibody-related genes. Methods The present study investigated, in a sample of at-risk midlife adults (N = 88), whether those randomized to learn loving-kindness meditation (LKM) in a 6-week workshop would show a reduction in CTRA gene expression, compared to those randomized to learn mindfulness meditation (MM). We assessed emotions daily and hypothesized positive emotions to account for the expected effect of LKM on gene expression. Results Results showed significant group differences from pre- to post-intervention, yet in the opposite direction as hypothesized: Participants randomized to the MM group showed significant declines in CTRA gene expression, whereas those in the LKM group showed significant increases in CTRA gene expression. Both groups showed increases over the 6 weeks in daily reports of positive emotions (b = .007, p < .001) alongside decreases in negative emotions (b = - .005, p < .001). Thus, positive emotions were not pursued as a candidate mediator of observed group effects. Conclusions This study is the first to examine whether the biological impact of childhood low SES can be reversed in midlife through meditation interventions. Results suggest mindfulness meditation may be a viable option for improving health outcomes in this at-risk population.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation to Target Affect in Mood Disorders: A Proof-of-Concept Study
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional treatments for mood disorders primarily focus on reducing negative affect, but little on enhancing positive affect. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a traditional meditation practice directly oriented toward enhancing unconditional and positive emotional states of kindness towards oneself and others. We report here two independent and uncontrolled studies carried out at different centers, one in Boston, USA (n = 10), and one in Frankfurt, Germany (n = 8), to examine the potential therapeutic utility of a brief LKM group intervention for symptoms of dysthymia and depression. Results at both centers suggest that LKM was associated with large-sized effects on self-reported symptoms of depression (d = 3.33 and 1.90), negative affect (d = 1.98 and 0.92), and positive affect (d = 1.63 and 0.94). Large effects were also found for clinician-reported changes in depression, rumination and specific positive emotions, and moderate effects for changes in adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The qualitative data analyses provide additional support for the potential clinical utility of the intervention. This proof-of-concept evaluation of LKM as a clinical strategy warrants further investigation.

TI  - Effects Of Modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) On The Psychological Health Of Adolescents With Subthreshold Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sub-threshold depression (SD) has been associated with impairments in adolescent health which increase the rate of major depression. Researchers have shown the effectiveness of mindfulness on mental health, however whether the traditional mindful skills were suitable for youngsters, it was not clear. This study investigated the effects of a tailed Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on their psychological state.Methods: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out. 56 participants who met the inclusion criteria agreed to be arranged randomly to either the MBSR group (n=28) or the control group (n=28). Participants in MBSR group received a tailored 8-week, one time per week, one hour each time group intervention. The effectiveness of intervention was measured using validated scales, which including BDI-II, MAAS, RRS at three times (T1-before intervention; T2-after intervention; T3-three months after intervention). A repeatedmeasures analysis of variance model was used to analyze the data.Results: The results showed significant improvements in MBSR group comparing with control group that depression level decreased after the 8-week intervention and the follow up (F =17.721, p < 0.00). At the same time, RRS score was significantly decreased at T2 and T3 (F= 28.277, p < 0.00). The results also showed that MBSR promoted the level of mindfulness and the effect persisted for three months after intervention (F=13.489, p < 0.00).Conclusion: A tailored MBSR intervention has positive effects on psychology health among SD youngsters, including decrease depression and rumination level, cultivate mindfulness.

TI  - THE ROLE OF MINDFULNESS IN POSITIVE REAPPRAISAL
T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness meditation is increasingly well known for therapeutic efficacy in a variety of illnesses and conditions, but its mechanism of action is still under debate in scientific circles. In this paper, we propose a hypothetical causal model that argues for the role of mindfulness in positive reappraisal coping. Positive reappraisal is a critical component of meaning-based coping that enables individuals to adapt successfully to stressful life events. Mindfulness, as a metacognitive form of awareness, involves the process of decentering, a shifting of cognitive sets that enables alternate appraisals of life events. We review the concept of positive reappraisal in transactional stress and coping theory, then describe research and traditional literature related to mindfulness and positive reappraisal, and detail the central role of mindfulness in the reappraisal process. With this understanding, we present a causal model explicating the proposed mechanism. The discussion has implications for clinical practice, suggesting how mindfulness-based integrative medicine interventions can be designed to support adaptive coping processes.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation practice associated with longer telomeres in women
T2  - BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively short telomere length may serve as a marker of accelerated aging, and shorter telomeres have been linked to chronic stress. Specific lifestyle behaviors that can mitigate the effects of stress might be associated with longer telomere lengths. Previous research suggests a link between behaviors that focus on the well-being of others, such as volunteering and caregiving, and overall health and longevity. We examined relative telomere length in a group of individuals experienced in Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM), a practice derived from the Buddhist tradition which utilizes a focus on unselfish kindness and warmth towards all people, and control participants who had done no meditation. Blood was collected by venipuncture, and Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Quantitative real time PCR was used to measure relative telomere length (RTL) (Cawthon, 2002) in fifteen LKM practitioners and 22 control participants. There were no significant differences in age, gender, race, education, or exposure to trauma, but the control group had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) and lower rates of past depression. The LKM practitioners had longer RTL than controls at the trend level (p = .083); among women, the LKM practitioners had significantly longer RTL than controls, (p = .007), which remained significant even after controlling for BMI and past depression. Although limited by small sample size, these results offer the intriguing possibility that LKM practice, especially in women, might alter RTL, a biomarker associated with longevity.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Mental Health of Clinical Clerkship Students: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo examine the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction training (MBSR) on the mental health of medical students during clinical clerkships.MethodBetween February 2011 and May 2014, the authors conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial of clerkships as usual (CAU) and clerkships with additional MBSR in medical students during their first year of clinical clerkships at a Dutch university medical center. MBSR consisted of eight weekly two-hour sessions, comprising didactic teaching, meditation exercises, and group dialogues. Students completed online assessments at baseline and after 3, 7, 12, 15, and 20 months. Outcome measures were psychological distress, positive mental health, life satisfaction, physician empathy, mindfulness skills, and dysfunctional cognitions as measured by validated tools.ResultsOf 232 eligible students, 167 students (72%) participated and were randomized by clerkship group into MBSR (n = 83) or CAU (n = 84). The MBSR group reported a small reduction of psychological distress (P =.03, Cohen's d = 0.20) and dysfunctional cognitions (P =.05, Cohen's d = 0.18) and a moderate increase of positive mental health (P =.002, Cohen's d = 0.44), life satisfaction (P =.01, Cohen's d = 0.51), and mindfulness skills (P =.05, Cohen's d = 0.35) compared with CAU during the 20-month follow-up. The authors detected no significant effect on physician empathy (P =.18, Cohen's d = 0.27).ConclusionsMBSR appeared feasible and acceptable to medical clerkship students and resulted in a small to moderate improvement of mental health compared with CAU over the 20-month follow-up.

TI  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditations in the workplace: A meta-analysis and future prospects
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) have been well applied among employees to improve their health and well-being. Existing studies on LKCM have also provided supportive evidence of its benefits and effectiveness under organizational contexts. The current meta-analytical study aimed to systematically summarise the effects of LKCM in the workplace and to outline directions for future research and practice. Among 327 empirical studies on LKCM published until March 2022, 21 trials focussed on employees and provided sufficient information, which were included in the following meta-analysis. The results showed that LKCM benefited eight categories of workplace outcomes. Specifically, LKCM effectively decreased employees' burnout (g = 0.395, k = 10) and stress (g = 0.544, k = 10) and facilitated their mindfulness (g = 0.558, k = 14), self-compassion (g = 0.646, k = 12), personal mental health (g = 0.308, k = 13), job attitudes (g = 0.283, k = 4), interpersonal relationships (g = 0.381, k = 12), and psychological resources (g = 0.406, k = 6). The results of moderation analyses further indicated that the participants' job type, gender, and the focus of LKCM might differentially fluctuate the magnitude of LKCM effects. To advance research and best practice, we finally pointed out several issues that deserve attention, such as long-term effects, underlying mechanisms, potential moderators, and outcomes or influential factors at the organizational level.

TI  - Meditation-based lifestyle modification in mild to moderate depression-A randomized controlled trial
T2  - DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Depression is a global key challenge in mental health care. The implementation of effective, low-risk and cost-effective interventions to reduce its disease burden is a necessity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the new Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program, a "second-generation" mindfulness-based intervention, in depressive outpatients. Methods Eighty-one patients with mild to moderate depression were randomized into three groups: intervention group (MBLM), control group (CONTROL), and treatment as usual group (TAU). The primary outcome was the change of depressive symptoms as administered by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) after 4 and 8 weeks. Secondary outcome variables included the Brief Symptom Checklist-18 and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. A 6-month follow-up was conducted. Results A greater reduction of depressive symptoms was found in MBLM participants compared to CONTROL (p < .001, eta(2)(p) = 0.11, d = 0.70) and TAU (p < . 001 , eta p 2 = 0 . 10 , d = 0 . 67 $p\lt .001,{\eta }_{{\rm{p}}}<^>{2}=0.10,d=0.67$) with a 13.15 points reduction of BDI-II score versus 1.71 points (CONTROL) and 3.34 points (TAU) after 8 weeks. Between-group post hoc tests for all secondary outcomes and at follow-up also yielded significant between-group differences with medium to large effect sizes in favor of MBLM. Conclusions Study results showed beneficial effects of MBLM in depressed outpatients. Further high-quality controlled clinical studies including qualitative research are needed to investigate the specific and unspecific effects of the MBLM program in depression and other medical conditions.

TI  - Effects of brief mindful breathing and loving-kindness meditation on shame and social problem solving abilities among individuals with high borderline personality traits
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental condition characterized by a range of cognitive and behavioral vulnerabilities, including chronic shame and deficits in social problem solving (SPS) abilities. Little research however, has examined strategies that may alleviate shame and SPS deficits among individuals with BPD traits. Using a laboratory experimental approach, the present study compared the effects of a brief mindfulness versus loving-kindness meditation (LKM) induction on shame and SPS abilities in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. Eighty-eight participants underwent a shame induction procedure involving recall of a negative autobiographical memory. They were then randomly assigned to 10 min of mindful breathing or LKM, or a no-instruction condition. Shame and SPS abilities were assessed via visual analogue scales and the Means-Ends Problem Solving task respectively. Results indicated that there were significant decreases in shame from pre-to post-regulation in the mindfulness group versus the LKM and no-instruction groups. Groups did not differ on changes in SPS abilities from pre-to post-regulation. Overall, the findings support the efficacy of mindfulness as a strategy to regulate shame among individuals with BPD traits, and raises questions with regard to the utility of LKM in modulating shame in the context of high emotional arousal.

TI  - Effects of a Mental Health Intervention in Athletes: Applying Self-Determination Theory.
T2  - Frontiers in psychology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Many sport associations have responded to mental health issues in sport through the inclusion of self-management programs, such as mindfulness training, which may improve well-being through increasing one's competence in self-regulating stressors. Yet, the mechanisms accounting such changes lack a theoretical basis, particularly in athletes. Aim: To determine the effect of a mental health intervention comprising a mindfulness program for promoting well-being, reducing stress, and increasing competence in mental health self-management. This is the first study among athletes to test the mechanisms of change in a mindfulness program using Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Methods: A 2 (groups) * 2 (time-point) non-randomized controlled trial was conducted, and between-groups baseline differences were firstly assessed. Two competing regression models assessing singular and serial indirect mediating mechanisms were conducted, in which mindfulness (Model 1) and competence satisfaction (Model 2) were both tested as primary and secondary mediators predicting change scores in stress and well-being. Demographic variables (i.e., gender, age) were controlled for in the analyses. Results: Two hundred and thirty-eight student athletes (mean age = 20.47 years, SD = 3.30, 57.6% = males) participated, with 108 in the intervention group who received an instructional workshop, and a home-directed mindfulness program comprising daily meditation sessions. No baseline differences were found between intervention and control groups. In Model 1, mindfulness was not directly enhanced by the intervention, subsequently resulting in no indirect effects on competence, stress and well-being. In Model 2, the intervention was directly related to positive changes in competence (beta = 0.39, p < 0.05), subsequently resulting in indirect effects on mindfulness awareness (beta = 0.07, p < 0.05), stress (beta = -0.06, p < 0.05), and well-being (beta = 0.05, p < 0.05). In addition, serial indirect effects for the intervention on stress were present through competence and mindfulness awareness in sequence (beta = -0.02, p < 0.05), and; on well-being through competence, mindfulness awareness, and stress in sequence (beta = 0.01, p < 0.05; R 2 = 0.54). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based mental health interventions may be effective at reducing stress and promoting well-being in athletes, with the caveat that attention is given to the inclusion of mental health competence promotion in program design. However, it remains unclear whether increasing mindfulness itself can exert additional salutary effects. Our findings have an important bearing on how mindfulness programs are developed within athlete mental health interventions.

T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current research points to occasional problems experienced by practitioners of the immeasurable or boundless states. From a historical perspective, the standard mode of teaching these by way of directing specific thoughts to a particular set of individuals is a later development in the Buddhist traditions, not attested in the early texts. Instead of being the sole way of teaching the cultivation of positive mental attitudes like metta and compassion, alternative approaches could be developed based on Buddhist canonical precedents that are less demanding in cognitive effort and closer in kind to the cultivation of mindfulness. In fact, mindfulness relates to metta and compassion in various ways, which reflects its multifunctionality in early Buddhist meditation theory.

TI  - Acceptance and commitment therapy versus mindfulness-based stress reduction for newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients: A randomized controlled trial assessing efficacy for positive psychology, depression, anxiety, and quality of life
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aimHead and neck cancer patients are vulnerable to various psychological complications due to the effects of both cancer itself and cancer treatment on patients' appearance and physical well-being. Nevertheless, few data have been obtained on effective psychosocial interventions that could protect this group of cancer patients' psychological well-being. Therefore, this three-armed, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) aims to evaluate and compare the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive psychology (such as posttraumatic growth [PTG], hope, and optimism), quality of life (QoL), and psychological complications (depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance) among newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients.Methods and analysisThis RCT will target newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been treated only with surgery or who have not yet received any treatment. In total, 120 patients who meet all of the study's inclusion criteria and none of its exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into three groups-an ACT group, an MBSR group, and a treatment-as-usual control group-at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in the two intervention groups (the ACT and MBSR groups) will undergo an eight-week group intervention program. During this program, each intervention will comprise eight modules based on ACT and MBSR, respectively. Outcome assessments will be performed across a three-point timeline, including before the intervention (t(0)), immediately after the psychosocial intervention at eight weeks (t(1)), and six months after the intervention (t(2)). The primary outcome that will be assessed during this RCT is PTG. Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes that will be evaluated in this study are such as QoL, hope, optimism, depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation Effects on Well-Being and Altruism: A Mixed-Methods Online RCT
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEvidence suggests that facilitating empathy could improve individuals' well-being. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) could be a facilitator, and online delivery a cost-effective format.MethodsWe conducted an internet-based randomised controlled trial recruiting 809 adults to test whether an LKM course improves well-being through evoking pleasant emotions, psychological resources, and altruism compared to a light physical exercise course (LE). Participants in both arms followed video-based instructions, completed post-intervention questionnaires, and used online diaries and forums. To measure altruism 10/$10 were offered to participants with a choice of donating all/half to charity. Thematic analysis was applied to diary/forum entries.ResultsBoth courses increased well-being without significant differences. LKM participants were less anxious than LE participants (ss = -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.43, -0.02], p = .03), and more likely to donate 5 pound/$5 (Relative Risk = 3.57, 95%CI [0.82, 15.50], p = .09). Attrition was high (82%). Participants engaged in diary/forum usage. LKM was an emotionally intense experience, generating deep reflections and increased connectedness but difficult for some to process. LE led to gentle increases in relaxation, generating a sense of achievement.ConclusionsFuture research needs to confirm findings and devise ways of delivering online LKM effectively to diverse populations.

TI  - Third-wave therapies and adults with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Third-wave therapies appear to produce positive outcomes for people without intellectual disabilities. This systematic review aimed to establish which third-wave therapies have been adapted for adults with intellectual disabilities and whether they produced positive outcomes. Method Four databases were searched systematically (PsycINFO, Web of Science, MEDLINE and PubMed), yielding 1,395 results. Twenty studies (N = 109) met the present review's inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results Included studies used mindfulness-based approaches, dialectical behaviour therapy, compassion focused therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. Due to considerable heterogeneity in the designs and outcome measures used, a meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions Evidence indicated that third-wave therapies improved mental health symptoms for some and improved challenging/offending behaviour, smoking and mindfulness/acceptance skills for most. These findings must be interpreted with caution due to the low methodological quality of included studies. Future research should build on the current evidence base, using scientifically rigorous designs and standardized measures.

TI  - Mindfulness and Savoring: A Commentary on Savoring Strategies and Their Implications for Addiction Treatment
T2  - SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Background: A central facet of the popular understanding of mindfulness practice is the non-judgmental observation of all thoughts and feelings. Savoring is a cognitive practice developed out of economics and positive psychology, which involves the conscious mental engagement with positively-valenced interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli, which in turn amplifies the derived pleasure experience. Results: When incorporated into mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), savoring holds promise in improving outcomes related to reward processing, such as positive affect and well-being. The growing body of mindfulness literature also suggests that the inclusion of savoring in MBIs may be key in treating disorders of reward dysregulation, such as addiction. If savoring does indeed reduce craving, this phenomenon offers a point of union for divergent neurobiological theories of addiction. Conclusion: In this commentary, we explore the existing literature on savoring and mindfulness practices as it relates to addictive disorders, posit underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, and present future areas of research.

TI  - MYmind: a Concurrent Group-Based Mindfulness Intervention for Youth with Autism and Their Parents
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The current study evaluated the use of MYmind, a concurrent mindfulness program in which youth with autism and their parents simultaneously receive group specific mindfulness training. Youth with autism can experience emotional and behavioral challenges, which are associated with parental stress. Mindfulness-based programs are emerging as a promising support for these challenges, for both children and parents. While two studies have documented the use of concurrent parent-child programs, neither involve control conditions. Methods Using a within-subject repeated measures design with a baseline component, 23 parent-child dyads were assessed on mindfulness, mental health, and youth emotion regulation and autism symptoms. Participants also rated their perceived improvement on a social validity questionnaire. Results There was improvement in youth autism symptoms, emotion regulation, and adaptive skills, and in parent reports of their own mindfulness following the program. There was also some indication of a waitlist effect for parent mental health, but not for other outcome variables. Participant feedback was mainly positive. Conclusions MYmind has the potential to contribute to emotion regulation and adaptability in youth with autism, and mindfulness in parents, though more rigorous controlled trials are needed.

TI  - Mindfulness-based interventions with youth: A comprehensive meta-analysis of group-design studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The treatment effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) with youth were synthesized from 76 studies involving 6121 participants. A total of 885 effect sizes were aggregated using meta-regression with robust variance estimation. Overall, MBIs were associated with small treatment effects in studies using pre-post (g = 0.305, SE = 0.039) and controlled designs (g = 0.322, SE = 0.040). Treatment effects were measured after a follow-up period in 24 studies (n = 1963). Results demonstrated that treatment effects were larger at follow-up than post-treatment in pre-post (g = 0.462, SE = 0.1 1 8) and controlled designs (g = 0.402, SE = 0.081). Moderator analyses indicated that intervention setting and intervention dosage were not meaningfully related to outcomes after controlling for study design quality. With that said, the between-study heterogeneity in the intercept-only models was consistently small, thus limiting the amount of variance for the moderators to explain. A series of exploratory analyses were used to investigate the differential effectiveness of MBIs across four therapeutic process domains and seven therapeutic outcome domains. Small, positive results were generally observed across the process and outcome domains. Notably, MBIs were associated with moderate effects on the process variable of mindfulness in controlled studies (n = 1108, g = 0.510). Limitations and directions for future research and practice are discussed. (C) 2017 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Understanding of the mechanisms by which meditation imparts beneficial effects on later -life mental health is limited. The current study assessed the role of compassionate love in mediating the relationship between meditation and mental health in later life. METHOD: Using data from a nationwide web -based survey (N = 1,861), we examined the indirect effects of meditation on depressive symptoms and anxiety via compassionate love. RESULTS: Participants who practiced meditation (compared to those who did not) had significantly higher feelings of being loved (b = 0.11, p < 0.05); those who experienced more love had lower depressive symptoms (b = -2.10, p < 0.001) and anxiety (b = -0.99, p < 0.001). Meditation also had significant indirect effects (via compassionate love) on depressive symptoms (b = -0.23, p < 0.05) and anxiety (b = -0.11, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study underscores the need for contemplative interventions that foster compassionate love to improve mental health in later life. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 50(3), 40-50.]

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential efficacy of a mindfulness-based stress reduction approach to improve quality of life in individuals who have suffered traumatic brain injuries.RESEARCH DESIGN: Pre-post design with drop-outs as controls.METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We recruited individuals with mild to moderate brain injuries, at least 1 year post-injury. We measured their quality of life, psychological status, and function. Results of 10 participants who completed the programme were compared to three drop-outs with complete data.EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTION: The intervention was delivered in 12-weekly group sessions. The intervention relied on insight meditation, breathing exercises, guided visualization, and group discussion. We aimed to encourage a new way of thinking about disability and life to bring a sense of acceptance, allowing participants to move beyond limiting beliefs.MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The treatment group mean quality of life (SF-36) improved by 15.40 (SD = 9.08) compared to - 1.67 (SD = 16.65; p = 0.036) for controls. Improvements on the cognitive-affective domain of the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) were reported (p = 0.029), while changes in the overall BDI-II (p = 0.059) and the Positive Symptom Distress Inventory of the SCL-90R (p = 0.054) approached statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was simple, and improved quality of life after other treatment avenues for these participants were exhausted.

However, which components of mindfulness (i.e., attentive monitoring and nonjudgmental acceptance) are most relevant treatment targets is unclear. Further, there is a dearth of literature examining clinical correlates of mindfulness in people with PD. The present study aimed to examine group differences and clinical correlates of mindfulness in people with PD. We hypothesized that PD would report lower monitoring and acceptance than CN and that mindfulness components would be associated with symptoms including dysfunctional beliefs, alexithymia, neurocognitive ability, positive symptoms, and mood symptoms. Groups included individuals with PD (n = 54) and nonpsychiatric controls (n = 55). Participants completed self -report measures of mindfulness and related constructs and clinical interviews of symptoms. Results of ANOVA models indicated that global mindfulness was lower in PD relative to CN, with greatest differences evident for acceptance in the affective psychosis group. Regression models found that greater monitoring was associated with improved neurocognitive performance, while acceptance was associated with lower defeatist beliefs, alexithymia, and depression/anxiety symptoms. Results highlight the importance of targeting acceptance in the psychosocial treatment of PDs, especially for those with mood symptoms.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Teachers: A Meta-Analysis of the Emerging Evidence Base
T2  - SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY
M3  - Review
AB  - Teachers report high levels of occupational stress, which is associated with teacher turnover and potential negative consequences for students. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may improve the protective factors that buffer educators against occupational stress. Although previous meta-analytic reviews synthesized the effects of MBIs for healthy and clinical samples of adults, this study was the first to synthesize the effects of MBIs for teachers (grades pre-K through 12). A total of 347 effect sizes from 29 studies (N = 1,493) were synthesized using metaregression with robust variance estimation. Overall, MBIs had a medium treatment effect on teacher outcomes (g = .601, SE = .089). Visual and statistical evidence of publication bias suggested this estimate may be positively biased. Three potential study-level moderators for overall effects were also examined, but none were statistically significant. MBIs were associated with small-to-medium positive effects on therapeutic processes and therapeutic outcomes. MBIs had the smallest effects on measures of classroom climate and instructional practices. Overall, findings were similar to other meta-analytic reviews of MBIs for nonclinical adult populations and working professionals. The literature on MBIs for teachers appears to have similar gaps as research on MBIs for adults (e.g., Davidson & Kaszniak, 2015), including the primary use of self-report measures, the lack of active treatment comparisons, and rare reporting of treatment fidelity data. Directions for future research and implications are discussed.

TI  - The Emerging Role of Buddhism in Clinical Psychology: Toward Effective Integration
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research into the clinical utility of Buddhist-derived interventions (BDIs) has increased greatly over the last decade. Although clinical interest has predominantly focused on mindfulness meditation, there also has been an increase in the scientific investigation of interventions that integrate other Buddhist principles such as compassion, loving kindness, and "non-self." However, due to the rapidity at which Buddhism has been assimilated into the mental health setting, issues relating to the misapplication of Buddhist terms and practices have sometimes arisen. Indeed, hitherto, there has been no unified system for the effective clinical operationalization of Buddhist principles. Therefore, this paper aims to establish robust foundations for the ongoing clinical implementation of Buddhist principles by providing: (i) succinct and accurate interpretations of Buddhist terms and principles that have become embedded into the clinical practice literature, (ii) an overview of current directions in the clinical operationalization of BDIs, and (iii) an assessment of BDI clinical integration issues. It is concluded that BDIs may be effective treatments for a variety of psychopathologies including mood-spectrum disorders, substance-use disorders, and schizophrenia. However, further research and clinical evaluation is required to strengthen the evidence-base for existent interventions and for establishing new treatment applications. More important, there is a need for greater dialogue between Buddhist teachers and mental health clinicians and researchers to safeguard the ethical values, efficacy, and credibility of BDIs.

TI  - MINDFULNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS: INITIAL DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP MINDFULNESS MEASURE
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trait mindfulness and mindfulness in the context of romantic relationships may not be completely overlapping constructs. This study adapted an existing measure of trait mindfulness to assess the tendency to be mindful in romantic relationships, the Relationship Mindfulness Measure (RMM). Using data from 185 young adults, the results supported the RMM's internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent and predictive validity. The RMM accounted for a significant portion of variance in positive relationship quality, negative relationship quality, and anxious and avoidant attachment, even after controlling for trait mindfulness. Based on these findings, assessing relationship mindfulness may improve research exploring the role of mindfulness in romantic relations and therefore facilitate the development and refinement of mindfulness training programs for couples.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions on the well-being of healthcare workers: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Growing evidence attests to the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), but their effectiveness for healthcare workers remains uncertain.Aims To evaluate the evidence for MBIs in improving healthcare workers' psychological well-being.Methods A systematic literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 31 August 2022 using the keywords 'healthcare worker', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'allied health', 'mindfulness', 'wellness', 'workshop' and 'program'. Randomised controlled trials with a defined MBI focusing on healthcare workers and quantitative outcome measures related to subjective or psychological well-being were eligible for inclusion. R V.4.0.3 was used for data analysis, with the standardised mean difference as the primary outcome, employing DerSimonian and Laird's random effects model. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies.Results A total of 27 studies with 2506 participants were included, mostly from the USA, involving various healthcare professions. MBIs such as stress reduction programmes, apps, meditation and training showed small to large effects on anxiety, burnout, stress, depression, psychological distress and job strain outcomes of the participants. Positive effects were also seen in self-compassion, empathy, mindfulness and well-being. However, long-term outcomes (1 month or longer postintervention) varied, and the effects were not consistently sustained.Conclusions MBIs offer short-term benefits in reducing stress-related symptoms in healthcare workers. The review also highlights limitations such as intervention heterogeneity, reduced power in specific subgroup analyses and variable study quality.PROSPERO registration number CRD42022353340.

TI  - Improving mindfulness through self-connection
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. - Mindfulness-based practices have received significant attention recently due to the numerous benefits that result from increased mindfulness. One construct, self-connection, is less well-known but appears to relate to mindfulness. Objective. - The current study experimentally manipulated self-connection in an attempt to increase people's mindfulness. Method. - A sample of 66 participants journaled for one week. Half of them discussed their days while the other half wrote about aspects of their day that related to self-connection. Results. - No significant difference in mindfulness emerged between groups after the week of journaling. However, those who journaled about self-connection were significantly more mindful a month later. In contrast, no sustained or significant increase in mindfulness emerged in the control group. Conclusion. - Although limited by its sample size, this study provides initial support for self-connection and its ability to improve mindfulness. More studies are needed to further examine self-connection and its relationship to mindfulness for both researchers and practitioners. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cognition, Emotion, and the Bladder: Psychosocial Factors in Bladder Pain Syndrome and Interstitial Cystitis (BPS/IC)
T2  - CURRENT BLADDER DYSFUNCTION REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review To review findings from empirical studies assessing the role of psychosocial factors in bladder pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC). Recent Findings There is a high rate of psychosocial comorbidity in BPS/IC, including elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Recent studies assessing the role of illness perceptions in BPS/IC relate poorer illness perceptions to more unhelpful illness coping patterns. Conversely, positive illness perceptions including self-efficacy in illness management are associated with more adaptive coping behaviors such as exercising and acceptance. New research is investigating the role of trauma in BPS/IC and the impact of suicidality. There is a paucity of psychosocial interventions for BPS/IC over the last 5 years. The three small-scale studies reviewed included a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention tailored for BPS/IC, a brief self-management intervention designed to increase patient knowledge and symptom management techniques and a 90-min interview aimed at increasing awareness about physiological affective relationship in IC. Illness-related cognitions impact illness-related coping behavior, distress, symptom severity, and QoL in BPS/IC. Positive illness perceptions can positively impact behavioral responses to illness and illness outcomes. Trauma, emotion regulation, and suicidality in BPS/IC are important factors for psychosocial interventions and multidisciplinary treatments to address. Insight from the existing evidence base and other functional illness areas such as IBS can be used to inform the design and assessment of interventions aimed to understand and treat BPS/IC as a biopsychosocial illness. The role of healthcare practitioners is fundamental to informing patient perceptions of their illness and providing adequate support for their own self-management approaches.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although self-care is often touted as being important to counselors and psychotherapists, historically little has been done within graduate school to provide future therapists with self-care strategies. This article proposes that mindfulness training offers a promising approach to therapist self-care and introduces qualitative research on the long-term impact of mindfulness training to substantiate this claim. Sixteen former students who are now practicing counselors were interviewed. Thirteen of them reported continuing to practice mindfulness techniques. Participants indicated that mindfulness continued to influence both their personal lives and self-care practices leading to positive influences in physical, emotional, cognitive, and interpersonal wellbeing. In their professional lives, participants described ways of incorporating mindfulness into their way of being a therapist, their interventions, and how they conceptualize their clients' issues.

TI  - Effects of interventions on depression and anxiety in older people with physical health problems in the criminal justice system: a systematic review
T2  - LANCET HEALTHY LONGEVITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The demand for health care in older people involved in the criminal justice system is high. The prevalence of mental and physical health conditions for people living in prison is greater than in community populations. After systematically searching 21 databases, we found no targeted interventions to support depression or anxiety for this group of people. 24 studies (including interventions of yoga, creative-arts-based programmes, positive psychology, or mindfulness-based interventions and psychotherapy) did contain people older than 50 years, but this only represented a minority (10%) of the overall study population. No single study reported outcomes of physical health. Future interventions need to consider the needs and views of this vulnerable group. Specific gendered and coproduced interventions are required to enhance the implementation, feasibility, and acceptability of interventions that are delivered in prisons.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness on psychological health: A review of empirical studies
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Within the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the investigation of mindfulness as a psychological construct and as a form of clinical intervention. This article reviews the empirical literature on the effects of mindfulness on psychological health. We begin with a discussion of the construct of mindfulness, differences between Buddhist and Western psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been integrated into Western medicine and psychology, before reviewing three areas of empirical research: cross-sectional, correlational research on the associations between mindfulness and various indicators of psychological health: intervention research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on psychological health: and laboratory-based, experimental research on the immediate effects of mindfulness inductions on emotional and behavioral functioning. We conclude that mindfulness brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation. The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and suggested directions for future research.. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Do Contemplative Moments Matter? Effects of Informal Meditation on Emotions and Perceived Social Integration
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives In contrast to formal meditation, which involves setting aside other activities to engage in contemplative practice, informal meditation can happen at any moment within the flow of daily activities. Whether informal meditation practice improves well-being is unclear. The purpose of this investigation was to test hypotheses about the day-to-day socioemotional profiles and dose-response relations, both within persons and between persons, associated with informal meditation practice. Methods Midlife adults (N = 231), new to meditation, were randomized to learn either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation in a 6-week workshop that taught both formal and informal meditation practices. The frequency of informal meditation practice was measured daily for 9 weeks. Likewise, formal meditation, emotions, and perceptions of social integration were also measured daily. Results Multilevel models of daily reports over a 9-week period revealed significant dose-response relations between the frequency of informal meditation and positive emotions and perceived social integration-both within persons and between persons (positive emotions: within-person b = 0.05, 95% CI [0.03, 0.07], between-person b = 0.35, 95% CI [0.20, 0.51]; social integration: within-person b = 0.11, 95% CI [0.07, 0.14], between-person b = 0.41, 95% CI [0.12, 0.70]). Effects were comparable for the distinct informal practices of mindfulness and loving-kindness, and were statistically independent of the effects of formal meditation practice. Conclusions The present research demonstrated that, distinct from formal meditation practice, informal meditation practice is linked to both positive emotions and social integration in a dose-response manner.

TI  - Do workplace-based mindfulness meditation programs improve physiological indices of stress? A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been related with improved job satisfaction, wellbeing, health, and reduced workplace stress with employees. However, until now, synthesis of the evidence of the effect of MBIs on physiological indices associated with stress and ill-health has been lacking. Therefore the current systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature from employee samples to provide guidance for future investigations in terms of which physiological indicators and biological systems may be most impacted by MBIs.Methods: Electronic databases were searched. Studies that conducted a mindfulness-based program with an employee sample, which targeted workplace stress or work engagement, and measured a physiological outcome were selected for inclusion. Studies using either a between-group or within-group design were included. Nine papers were found to meet the inclusion criteria for our systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.Results: MBIs were found to be effective in reducing cortisol production, as indicated by lowered high and low diurnal cortisol slopes. However, no changes were found for cortisol awakening response or concentrations for single a.m. and p.m. time-points. MBIs also improved autonomic balance, assessed by heart rate variability coherence measures, but not blood pressure. Sympathetic nervous system reactivity as measured by salivary alpha amylase was also reduced following MBI. While aspects of immune function were also improved following MBIs, specifically, increased antibody response to a viral vaccine and reduced C-reactive protein concentrations, each of these outcomes were only assessed in a single study.Conclusion: Taken together, the findings suggest that MBIs are a promising avenue for intervention for improving physiological indices of stress. Our findings suggest that changes in daytime cortisol secretion and HRV coherence may be particularly influenced by MBIs. Future studies should aim to assess multiple physiological indices to confirm the current findings and further improve current understanding of which biological systems (and indices within these systems) show responses indicative of reduced stress due to MBI.

TI  - Tracking Longitudinal Changes in Affect and Mindfulness Caused by Concentration and Loving-kindness Meditation with Hierarchical Linear Modeling
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the relative effects of 5 weeks of either concentration or loving-kindness meditation (CM, LKM) on mindfulness (including two subscales-presence and acceptance) and affect using a multiple baseline ABA design. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) indicated that 48-71 % of the total variance was attributable to individual differences. While meditating, CM practitioners experienced progressive increases in mindfulness and acceptance, while LKM practitioners exhibited increases in mindfulness, presence, and positive affect. When practitioners ceased meditation, those in the CM condition declined in mindfulness, acceptance, and positive affect throughout the cessation period. Individuals in the LKM group showed a progressive decrease in presence and a singular drop in negative affect immediately following meditation. There was a dissociation between acceptance and presence, with CM influencing the former and LKM the latter. Because mindfulness and positive affect did not decrease after the meditation period for the LKM group, these results suggest that LKM may induce more enduring changes in these variables. However, while meditation-specific HLMs indicated differences between meditation types, a combined HLM with both meditation conditions showed no group differences in the meditation or cessation phases of the study. More substantial were individual differences in response to meditation; these point to the necessity of using either large sample sizes in group means testing for meditation research or techniques permitting individual-based analysis such as HLM and single-subject designs.

TI  - Nursing students' trait mindfulness and psychological stress: A correlation and mediation analysis
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nursing students face a great amount of psychological stress during their nursing education. Mindfulness-based training has received increased recognition from nurse educators regarding its effect on reducing students' psychological stress. Study evidence has supported that cultivation of trait mindfulness through Mindfulness-based training was the key to this effect. However, there is a lack of research that focuses on intricate relationships between various facets of trait mindfulness and psychological stress.Objective: Examining the relationships between various trait mindfulness facets and psychological stress.Design: A cross-sectional design was used to collect data on trait mindfulness facets and psychological stress.Participants: A convenience sample of 99 undergraduate nursing students from a Bachelor of Nursing program completed this study.Setting: This study was conducted in a university in the south-eastern United States.Method: Participants completed an online questionnaire, which collected their demographic information, trait mindfulness (the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire), and psychological stress (the Perceived Stress Scale-10). Correlation and mediation analyses were applied.Results: Other than the trait mindfulness facet of observing, the remaining three facets (acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity) were negatively correlated with psychological stress. Observing had little to low correlations with non-judging and acting with awareness, but attained a moderately positive correlation with non-reactivity. Moreover, observing could indirectly predict psychological stress, when non-reactivity served as a mediator. Finally, non-judging partially mediated the relationship between acting with awareness and psychological stress.Conclusions: The results of the current study can help nurse educators better understand the intricate relationships between various facets of trait mindfulness and psychological stress. Specifically, facets of acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity are directly relevant to the reduction of psychological stress. Therefore, regardless of formal or informal practices of mindfulness, nurse educators ought to assist students in cultivating these facets as means toward stress management.

TI  - Differences in the Semantics of Prosocial Words: an Exploration of Compassion and Kindness
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The study of prosocial behaviour has accelerated greatly in the last 20 years. Researchers are exploring different domains of prosocial behaviour such as compassion, kindness, caring, cooperation, empathy, sympathy, love, altruism and morality. While these constructs can overlap, and are sometimes used interchangeably, they also have distinctive features that require careful elucidation. This paper discusses some of the controversies and complexities of describing different (prosocial) mental states, followed by a study investigating the differences between two related prosocial concepts: compassion and kindness. Methods For the study, a scenario-based questionnaire was developed to assess the degree to which a student (N = 222) and a community (N = 112) sample judged scenarios in terms of compassion or kindness. Subsequently, participants rated emotions (e.g. sadness, anxiety, anger, disgust, joy) associated with each scenario. Results Both groups clearly distinguished kindness from compassion in the scenarios on the basis of suffering. In addition, participants rated compassion-based scenarios as significantly higher on sadness, anger, anxiety and disgust, whereas kindness-based scenarios had higher levels of joy. As a follow-up, a further sample (29 male, 63 female) also rated compassionate scenarios as involving significantly more suffering compared to the kindness scenarios. Conclusions Although overlapping concepts, compassion and kindness are clearly understood as different processes with different foci, competencies and emotion textures. This has implications for research in prosocial behaviour, and the cultivation of kindness and compassion for psychotherapy and in general.

TI  - A longitudinal study on the association between facets of mindfulness and eating disorder symptoms in individuals diagnosed with eating disorders
T2  - EUROPEAN EATING DISORDERS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based treatments for eating disorders could be improved by understanding how facets of mindfulness predict eating disorder symptoms over time. We examined whether facets of mindfulness predict eating disorder symptoms over time and vice versa. Individuals with an eating disorder diagnosis (N = 124; 87.9% diagnosed with anorexia nervosa) and an undergraduate sample (N = 290) completed measures of mindfulness at baseline. The clinical sample also completed these measures 1 month later. Individuals in the clinical sample had lower acting with awareness and higher observing than individuals in the undergraduate sample (ps < 0.002). In the clinical sample, higher body dissatisfaction prospectively predicted lower acting with awareness (p = 0.02). Lower acting with awareness prospectively predicted higher drive for thinness (p < 0.01) and bulimic symptoms (p < 0.01). Acting with awareness shows potential as a process that can be altered to effect positive outcomes on drive for thinness and bulimic symptoms.

TI  - Genetic Disorders of Intellectual Disability: Expanding our Concepts of Phenotypes and of Family Outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENETIC COUNSELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, great strides have been made in our understandings of how genetic conditions influence behavior and how such so-called "behavioral phenotypes" influence parent and family stress and coping. In this paper, we call for expansions in two directions. First, as a field we need to go beyond behavior in our concepts of phenotypes, to also include the many medical, physical, and other "non-behavioral" phenotypes that influence children's everyday lives. Second, in examining how etiology-related phenotypes affect others, we need to go beyond the outcome of parental stress. In this regard, we focus on parental health, well-being, and various life choices, as well as how parenting children with specific genetic disorders can often lead to positive perceptions and outcomes. We end by discussing remaining research issues and how these two expansions relate to clinical practice.

TI  - Integrative Approaches to Minimize Peri-operative Symptoms
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Cancer patients who require surgery often experience peri-operative symptoms, including nausea, anxiety, and pain, which can significantly impair quality of life. Here, we review the evidence for using integrative approaches to manage these peri-operative symptoms.Recent Findings Conventional peri-operative pharmacologic interventions, such as opiates for pain control, can lead to adverse effects such as respiratory depression, prolonged hospital course, and long-term dependence. Integrative medicine, also known as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), has been explored as way to reduce peri-operative symptoms. Acupuncture, guided imagery, and loving-kindness meditation have all shown potential efficacy in reducing both peri-operative pain and anxiety in retrospective studies and small randomized controlled trials.Summary Integrative medicine techniques, such as acupuncture, are a promising approach to control peri-operative symptoms without the associated adverse effects of more conventional pharmacologic interventions.

T2  - African journal of primary health care & family medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to have significant health benefits in studies conducted in the global North.AIM: This study examined the effects of MBSR on stress, mood states and medical symptoms among urban South Africans to inform future research and clinical directions of MBSR in local settings.SETTING: Participants completed an 8-week MBSR programme based in central Cape Town.METHOD: A retrospective analysis of 276 clinical records was conducted. Mindfulness, stress, negative and positive mood, medical symptoms and psychological symptoms were assessed before and after the intervention using self-report questionnaires. We compared pre and postintervention scores and examined the relationship between changes in mindfulness and changes in stress, mood and medical symptoms.RESULTS: Mindfulness scores were significantly higher after intervention, both on the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Changes on the KIMS were associated with reductions in stress, negative mood, psychological symptoms and total medical symptoms, and improvement in positive mood. Changes in mindfulness, as measured by the MAAS, were significantly correlated only with reduced total number of medical symptoms.CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for the positive health impact of MBSR on urban South Africans, and in turn acceptability and feasibility evidence for MBSR in South Africa and supports the case for larger trials in different local settings.

TI  - Development of the Appreciative Joy Scale
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Appreciative joy (or sympathetic joy) refers to feeling happiness for others and is one of the four prosocial attitudes ("four immeasurables") cultivated by loving-kindness meditation in Buddhism. The current study included 1622 participants and developed a scale to measure appreciative joy for friends in daily life. Both an exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in an appreciative joy scale consisting of three components: sense of joy, positive interpersonal bias, and self-transcendence (study 1). The appreciative joy scale exhibited high correlations with measurements for interpersonal relationships and four immeasurables. The scale also shows incremental contributions to positive emotions, satisfaction with life, trait happiness, and peace of mind after controlling for interpersonal relationships or the four immeasurables (studies 2 and 3). The scale exhibited higher scores among Buddhists than among individuals with no religious belief, and its structure was maintained across English and Chinese samples (study 4); in addition, it demonstrated good test-retest reliability (study 5). Overall, the current study validated the scale as a useful tool for measuring appreciative joy, and certain findings also highlighted directions for future research on appreciative joy, including causal relationships with positive emotions, comparisons with compassion, and effects on envy.

TI  - Common spatial pattern for classification of loving kindness meditation EEG for single and multiple sessions
T2  - BRAIN INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - While a very few studies have been conducted on classifying loving kindness meditation (LKM) and non-meditation electroencephalography (EEG) data for a single session, there are no such studies conducted for multiple session EEG data. Thus, this study aims at classifying existing raw EEG meditation data on single and multiple sessions to come up with meaningful inferences which will be highly beneficial when developing algorithms that can support meditation practices. In this analysis, data have been collected on Pre-Resting (before-meditation), Post-Resting (after-meditation), LKM-Self and LKM-Others for 32 participants and hence allowing us to conduct six pairwise comparisons for the four mind tasks. Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a feature extraction method widely used in motor imaginary brain computer interface (BCI), but not in meditation EEG data. Therefore, using CSP in extracting features from meditation EEG data and classifying meditation/non-meditation instances, particularly for multiple sessions will create a new path in future meditation EEG research. The classification was done using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) where both meditation techniques (LKM-Self and LKM-Others) were compared with Pre-Resting and Post-Resting instances. The results show that for a single session of 32 participants, around 99.5% accuracy was obtained for classifying meditation/Pre-Resting instances. For the 15 participants when using five sessions of EEG data, around 83.6% accuracy was obtained for classifying meditation/Pre-Resting instances. The results demonstrate the ability to classify meditation/Pre-Resting data. Most importantly, this classification is possible for multiple session data as well. In addition to this, when comparing the classification accuracies of the six mind task pairs; LKM-Self, LKM-Others and Post-Resting produced relatively lower accuracies among them than the accuracies obtained for classifying Pre-Resting with the other three. This indicates that Pre-Resting has some features giving a better classification indicating that it is different from the other three mind tasks.

TI  - Mindfulness-based intervention reduce interference of negative stimuli to working memory in individuals with subclinical depression: A randomized controlled fMRI study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Individuals with subclinical depression are prone to major depression and experience emotional responses and attentional biases to negative stimuli. Method: In a randomized controlled study (N = 42) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the neurocognitive mechanisms behind mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) combining loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on a group with subclinical depression compared with the relaxation group across emotional face n -back (EFNBACK) tasks and resting state. We also collected behavioral and self-reported data to confirm neurocognitive results. Results: During EFNBACK, the MBCT+LKM group showed greater activation in the left lingual gyrus and right inferior lateral occipital cortex. During rest, the MBCT+LKM group demonstrated increased connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and right inferior lateral occipital cortex, right anterior insula and left precentral gyrus. From amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) data, activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control decreased and activity in brain regions associated with sensorimotor increased. Conclusion: These results suggest that MBCT+LKM alleviate depression for subclinical individuals through improving executive function when they face negative stimuli.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-compassion is conceptualized as containing 3 core components: self-kindness versus self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus overidentification, when relating to painful experiences. Research evidence demonstrates that self-compassion is related to psychological flourishing and reduced psychopathology. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) is an 8-week training program, meeting 2.5 hours each week, designed to help participants cultivate self-compassion. MSC contains a variety of meditations (e.g., loving-kindness, affectionate breathing) as well as informal practices for use in daily life (e.g., soothing touch, self-compassionate letter writing). A detailed clinical case illustrates the journey of a client through the 8 weeks of MSC training, describing the key features of each session and the client's response.

TI  - BDNF Val66Met, stress, and positive mothering: Differential susceptibility model of adolescent trait anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Etiological research has indicated the gene-environment interaction (G x E) on adolescent anxiety. This study aimed to examine how the BDNF Val 66Met polymorphism interacted with stressful life events and positive mothering to influence youth trait anxiety. The study sample included 780 community adolescents of Chinese Han ethnicity (M = 13.6, 51.3% females). Participants' trait anxiety, exposure to stressful life events, and mother's warmth-reasoning were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. We found that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism significantly moderated the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety. The influences were significantly greater in adolescents carrying one or two Val allele than those with Met/Met genotype. Moreover, the G x E interactions were more consistent with the differential susceptibility than the diathesis-stress model. Adolescents carrying Val allele who were more susceptible to adversity were also more likely to benefit from supportive experiences. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of BDNF Val66Met as a genetic susceptibility modulating the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety. We speculate that BDNF Val66Met may moderate anxious youths' responses to mindfulness-based stress reduction program and family-based treatment targeting the enhancement of positive parenting.

TI  - Loving-kindness meditation slows biological aging in novices: Evidence from a 12-week randomized controlled trial
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Combinations of multiple meditation practices have been shown to reduce the attrition of telomeres, the protective caps of chromosomes (Carlson et al., 2015). Here, we probed the distinct effects on telomere length (TL) of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Midlife adults (N = 142) were randomized to be in a waitlist control condition or to learn either MM or LKM in a 6-week workshop. Telomere length was assessed 2 weeks before the start of the workshops and 3 weeks after their termination. After controlling for appropriate demographic covariates and baseline TL, we found TL decreased significantly in the MM group and the control group, but not in the LKM group. There was also significantly less TL attrition in the LKM group than the control group. The MM group showed changes in TL. that were intermediate between the LKM and control groups yet not significantly different from either. Self-reported emotions and practice intensity (duration and frequency) did not mediate these observed group differences. This study is the first to disentangle the effects of LKM and MM on TL and suggests that LKM may buffer telomere attrition.

TI  - Resilience@Work Mindfulness Program: Results From a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial With First Responders
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A growing body of research suggests that resilience training can play a pivotal role in creating mentally healthy workplaces, particularly with regard to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. Emerging research describes positive outcomes from various types of resilience training programs (RTPs) among different occupational groups. One specific group of workers that may benefit from this form of proactive resilience training is first responders. Given the nature of their work, first responders are frequently exposed to stressful circumstances and potentially traumatic events, which may impact their overall resilience and well-being over time.Objective: This study aimed to examine whether a mindfulness-based RTP (the Resilience@Work [RAW] Mindfulness Program) delivered via the internet can effectively enhance resilience among a group of high-risk workers. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comprising 24 Primary Fire and Rescue and Hazmat stations within New South Wales. Overall, 12 stations were assigned to the 6-session RAW Mindfulness Program and 12 stations were assigned to the control condition. A total of 143 active full-time firefighters enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, immediately post training, and at 6-month follow-up. Measurements examined change in both adaptive and bounce-back resilience as well as several secondary outcomes examining resilience resources and acceptance and mindfulness skills.Results: Mixed-model repeated measures analysis found that the overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P=.008), with the intervention group increasing in adaptive resilience over time. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group in terms of change in bounce-back resilience (P=.09). At 6-month follow-up, the group receiving the RAW intervention had an average increase in their resilience score of 1.3, equating to a moderate-to-large effect size compared with the control group of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38-1.06). Per-protocol analysis found that compared with the control group, the greatest improvements in adaptive resilience were observed among those who completed most of the RAW program, that is, 5 to 6 sessions (P=.002).Conclusions: The results of this RCT suggest that mindfulness-based resilience training delivered in an internet format can create improvements in adaptive resilience and related resources among high-risk workers, such as first responders. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this study suggest that the RAW Mindfulness Program is an effective, scalable, and practical means of delivering online resilience training in high-risk workplace settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based RTP delivered entirely via the internet has been tested in the workplace.

TI  - Atypical Anxiety-Related Amygdala Reactivity and Functional Connectivity in Sant Mat Meditation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While meditation has drawn much attention in cognitive neuroscience, the neural mechanisms underlying its emotional processing remains elusive. Sant Mat meditators were recruited, who adopt a loving-kindness mode of meditation along with a vegetarian diet and an alcohol-restricted lifestyle and novices. We assessed their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and scanned their amygdala reactivity in response to an explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of fearful and happy faces. In contrast with novices, meditators reported lower STAI scores. Meditators showed stronger amygdala reactivity to explicit happiness than to fear, whereas novices exhibited the opposite pattern. The amygdala reactivity was reduced in meditators regardless of implicit fear or happiness. Those who had more lifetime practice in meditation reported lower STAI and showed a weaker amygdala response to fear. Furthermore, the amygdala in meditators, relative to novices, had a stronger positive functional connectivity with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explicit happiness, but a more negative connectivity with the insula and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to explicit fear. Mediation analysis indicated the amygdala reactivity as the mediator for the linkage between meditation experience and trait anxiety. The findings demonstrate the neural correlates that underpin the beneficial effects of meditation in Sant Mat. Long-term meditation could be functionally coupled with the amygdala reactivity to explicit and implicit emotional processing, which would help reduce anxiety and potentially enhance well-being.

T2  - CONTEMPORARY BUDDHISM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers a comparative analysis on mindfulness from mindfulness-based therapies in the contemporary literature and from Buddhist meditation practices in the Pli Canon. This includes a review of the presiding definitions of mindfulness, recent scientific findings in the literature and the current theories on the underlying mechanisms of mindfulness. The meditation practices from the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme are compared to the origins of mindfulness of breathing meditations from the Satipatthna Sutta (MN 10). Further, recent research into the cultivation of skilful states of mind including compassion, self-compassion, loving-kindness, equanimity and sympathetic joy are reviewed and compared to an anthology of texts from the Pli Canon. Ethical issues emerging from the convergence of science and Buddhist philosophy are also discussed for further consideration.Abbreviations: AN: A?guttara Nikya; BPS: Buddhist Publication Society; Dhp: Dhammapada; Dhs: Dhammasa?ga?; DN: Dgha Nikya; Iti: Itivuttaka; MN: Majjhima Nikya; Miln: Milindapanha; Patis: Patisambhidmagga; SN: Sa?yutta Nikya; Sn: Sutta Nipta; Ud: Udna; Vibh: Vibha?ga; Vim: Vimuttimagga; Vsm: Visuddhimagga

TI  - A study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial on mindfulness-based stress reduction: studying effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction and an additional organisational health intervention on mental health and work-related perceptions of teachers in Dutch secondary vocational schools
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Dutch teachers in secondary vocational schools suffer from stress and burnout complaints that can cause considerable problems at work. This paper presents a study design that can be used to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a person-focused intervention, both within and outside of the context of an additional organisational health intervention. Methods The proposed study comprises a cluster randomised controlled trial that will be conducted in at least three secondary vocational schools, to which teachers will be recruited from three types of courses: Care, Technology, and Economy. The allocation of the intervention programme to the participating schools will be randomised. The teachers from each school will be assigned to intervention group 1 (IG 1), intervention group 2 (IG 2), or the waiting list group (WG). IG 1 will receive MBSR training and IG 2 will receive MBSR training combined with an additional organisational health intervention. WG, that is the control group, will receive MBSR training one year later. The primary outcome variable of the proposed study is mindfulness, which will be measured using the Dutch version of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-NL). In the conceptual model, the effects of teachers' mindfulness resulting from the intervention programmes (MBSR training and MBSR training combined with an additional organisational health intervention) will be related to salient (secondary outcome) variables: mental health outcomes (e.g., burnout, work engagement), work performance, work-related perceptions (job demands and job resources), and personal competencies (e.g., occupational self-efficacy). Data will be collected before (T-0) and immediately after the MBSR training (T-1), and 3 (T-2) and 9 months (T-3) after the training. The power analysis revealed a required sample size of 66 teachers (22 in each group). Discussion The proposed study aims to provide insight into (1) the short-term and long-term effects of MBSR on teachers' mental health, (2) the possible enhancing effects of the additional organisational health intervention, and (3) the teachers' experiences with the interventions (working mechanisms, steps in the mindfulness change process). Strengths of this study design are the use of both positive and negative outcomes, the wide range of outcomes, both outcome and process measures, longitudinal data, mixed methods, and an integral approach. Although the proposed study protocol may not address all weaknesses of current studies (e.g., self-selection bias, self-reporting of data, the Hawthorne effect), it is innovative in many ways and can be expected to make important contributions to both the scientific and practical debate on how to beat work-related stress and occupational burnout, and on how to enhance work engagement and work performance.

TI  - The roles of gratitude and mindfulness between cyberbullying perpetration and depression among children in rural China: A moderated mediation model
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous literature suggests that gratitude and mindfulness-based intervention could effectively abate stressful life events, while the associations with cyberbullying perpetration have not been investigated. Little is known about the mechanisms of this association, especially for children who lack sufficient parental protection. The current study aimed to examine the roles of mindfulness and gratitude in the relationship between cyberbullying perpetration and depression among children and adolescents. This study employed data from a school-based survey conducted in 2018, in which 1298 students aged 9-16 years were randomly selected from three elementary and middle schools in China. The moderated mediation effects of gratitude and mindfulness on the relationship between cyberbullying perpetration and depression were examined through PROCESS model. Results showed that mindfulness mediated the relationship between cyberbullying perpetration and depression, while gratitude moderated and weakened the relationship. The findings may offer insights into the awareness and intervention programs regarding positive psychological mechanisms to reduce cyberbullying perpetration among children and adolescents in China.

TI  - Increased gray matter volume in the right angular and posterior parahippocampal gyri in loving-kindness meditators
T2  - SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have revealed that meditation is associated with structural brain changes in regions underlying cognitive processes that are required for attention or mindfulness during meditation. This VBM study examined brain changes related to the practice of an emotion-oriented meditation: loving-kindness meditation (LKM). A 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner captured images of the brain structures of 25 men, 10 of whom had practiced LKM in the Theravada tradition for at least 5 years. Compared with novices, more gray matter volume was detected in the right angular and posterior parahippocampal gyri in LKM experts. The right angular gyrus has not been previously reported to have structural differences associated with meditation, and its specific role in mind and cognitive empathy theory suggests the uniqueness of this finding for LKM practice. These regions are important for affective regulation associated with empathic response, anxiety and mood. At the same time, gray matter volume in the left temporal lobe in the LKM experts appeared to be greater, an observation that has also been reported in previous MRI meditation studies on meditation styles other than LKM. Overall, the findings of our study suggest that experience in LKM may influence brain structures associated with affective regulation.

TI  - Mindful breath awareness meditation facilitates efficiency gains in brain networks: A steady-state visually evoked potentials study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The beneficial effects of mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions have stimulated a rapidly growing body of scientific research into underlying psychological processes. Resulting evidence indicates that engaging with mindfulness meditation is associated with increased performance on a range of cognitive tasks. However, the mechanisms promoting these improvements require further investigation. We studied changes in behavioural performance of 34 participants during a multiple object tracking (MOT) task that taps core cognitive processes, namely sustained selective visual attention and spatial working memory. Concurrently, we recorded the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), an EEG signal elicited by the continuously flickering moving objects, and indicator of attentional engagement. Participants were tested before and after practicing eight weeks of mindful breath awareness meditation or progressive muscle relaxation as active control condition. The meditation group improved their MOT-performance and exhibited a reduction of SSVEP amplitudes, whereas no such changes were observed in the relaxation group. Neither group changed in self-reported positive affect and mindfulness, while a marginal increase in negative affect was observed in the mindfulness group. This novel way of combining MOT and SSVEP provides the important insight that mindful breath awareness meditation may lead to refinements of attention networks, enabling more efficient use of attentional resources.

TI  - An App-Based Loving-Kindness Training to Facilitate Compassion, Team Cohesion, and Fairness
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SPORTPSYCHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study employed a quasi-experimental design, in which the experimental group (n = 13) practiced a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) via a single in-person workshop and via an app, whereas the active control group (n = 20) practiced progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Both interventions lasted 1 week and were executed in the respective soccer academy. The groups completed a pre- and posttest measuring compassion, fairness, and team cohesion. In contrast to our hypothesis, we did not find an interaction effect. LKM athletes did not demonstrate greater cohesion, fairness, and compassion after the intervention than the PMR athletes. By comparing user engagement and user rating between LKM and PMR, we conclude that LKM is as accepted as PMR by the study cohort. We suggest implementing future LKM interventions with substantial interaction parts and considering specific person-by-context interactions.

TI  - Non-pharmacologic interventions to improve depression and anxiety among pregnant and parenting women who use substances: An integrative literature review
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Pregnant and parenting women who use substances report high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety. Due to the significant impact of this comorbidity on treatment adherence and maternal/child outcomes, effective psychosocial and behavioral interventions to address depression and anxiety in this population are necessary. A directed search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases produced 22 articles from 20 distinct studies examining non-pharmacologic interventions with an effect on depression and anxiety among pregnant or parenting women using substances. Of the 20 studies reviewed, 8 were randomized controlled trials, 7 were quasi-experimental studies, and 5 were cohort studies. Results revealed a wide array of interventions targeting intrapersonal, interpersonal, and/or structural factors within these women's lives. Parenting therapy and psychosocially enhanced treatment programs had the strongest evidence for positive treatment effect in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety. The use of contingency-management, case-managed care, patient or wellness navigators, mindfulness-based therapy, maternal-child relationship-focused therapy, family therapy, peer support, and therapeutic community-based interventions show promise but warrant further experimental exploration. Comprehensive and gender-specific residential treatment was observationally associated with improvements in depression and anxiety; however, the specific modality of efficacy is unclear. Future research should focus on identifying which modalities are most cost-effective, feasible, and acceptable among this uniquely vulnerable population.

TI  - Mindfulness and Nondual Well-Being - What is the Evidence that We Can Stay Happy?
T2  - REVIEW OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research into subjective well-being (SWB) focuses on conducive life conditions, healthy cognitive-affective processes and adaptive behaviours, however, in this model, well-being fluctuates based on changing mental and physical phenomena. This inquiry explores the possibility that we can have a nondual experience of well-being that is unaffected by such movements and investigates if the literature supports this. The assertion in traditional mindfulness that the sense of self is constructed and responsible for such fluctuations is explored, along with what evidence there is that mindfulness practices deliver relevant cognitive and behavioural correlates associated with such a way of being. Proposed preconditions include (a) nondual awareness or the perception of no-self; (b) increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and increased self-lessness; (c) increased capacity to maintain (or protect) well-being including heightened emotional self-regulation and resilience to aversive stimuli. Research findings provide some evidence that the sense of self can be both constructed and deconstructed, and that mindfulness training may target psychological dimensions that could contribute to an experience of well-being that transcends the impact of life conditions. Recommendations are made for a collaborative relationship between SWB research and mindfulness to expand the inquiry into possible causes and conditions of 'nondual well-being'.

TI  - Positive Psychology Interventions in Medical Populations: Critical Issues in Intervention Development, Testing, and Implementation
T2  - AFFECTIVE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Positive psychological well-being is prospectively associated with superior health outcomes. Positive psychology interventions have promise as a potentially feasible and effective means of increasing well-being and health in those with medical illness, and several initial studies have shown the potential of such programs in medical populations. At the same time, numerous key issues in the existing positive psychology literature must be addressed to ensure that these interventions are optimally effective. These include (1) assessing the nature and scope of PPWB as part of intervention development and application; (2) identifying and utilizing theoretical models that can clearly outline potential mechanisms by which positive psychology interventions may affect health outcomes; (3) determining consistent, realistic targets for positive psychology interventions; (4) developing consistent approaches to the promotion of positive psychological well-being; (5) emphasizing the inclusion of diverse samples in treatment development and testing; and (6) considering implementation and scalability from the start of intervention development to ensure effective real-world application. Attention to these six domains could greatly facilitate the generation of effective, replicable, and easily adopted positive psychology programs for medical populations with the potential to have an important impact on public health.

TI  - POSITIVE EFFECTS OF A STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAM BASED ON MINDFULNESS MEDITATION IN BRAZILIAN NURSING PROFESSIONALS: QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION
T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Mindfulness meditation has been shown to effectively mitigate the negative effects of stress among nursing professionals, but in countries like Brazil, these practices are relatively unexplored.Objective: To evaluate the effects of a Stress Reduction Program (SRP) including mindfulness and loving kindness meditation among nursing professionals working in a Brazilian hospital setting.Design: Pilot study with a mixed model using quantitative and qualitative methods was used to evaluate a group of participants. The quantitative data were analyzed at three different time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up. The qualitative data were analyzed at post-intervention.Setting: Hospital Sao Paulo (Brazil).Participants: Sample 13 nursing professionals, including nurses, technicians, and nursing assistants working in a hospital.Intervention: Participants underwent mindfulness and loving kindness meditation during a period of six weeks.Instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment, and Work Stress Scale (WSS). Qualitative data were collected via a group interview following six weeks participation in the SRP.Results: The quantitative analyses revealed a significant reduction (P<.05) between pm-intervention and post intervention scores for perceived stress, burnout, depression, and anxiety (trait). These variables showed no significant differences between post-intervention and follow-up scores. The WHOQOL-BREF revealed significant increase (P<.05) just in the physical and psychological domains at post intervention scores, which remained at the follow-up. Qualitative results showed improvement in the reactivity to inner experience; a more attentive perception of internal and external experiences; greater attention and awareness of actions and attitudes at every moment; and a positive influence of the SRP in nursing activities.

TI  - Experiencing meditation - Evidence for differential effects of three contemplative mental practices in micro-phenomenological interviews
T2  - CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing interest in effects of meditation, systematic in-depth research on how it qualitatively feels to engage in different kinds of contemplative practices is still missing. To fill this gap, we explore the validity of Micro-phenomenological Interviews (MpI) to assess experiences during breathing meditation (BM), observing-thought meditation (OTM), and lovingkindness meditation (LKM). We performed psycholinguistic analyses, quantitative ratings and qualitative explorations of 104 MpI (N = 57). All results reveal differential affective, bodily and sensorial fingerprints: BM-transcripts contain the most body-related vocabulary, specifically sensations in nose and abdomen. OTM-transcripts contain the most cognition-related vocabulary. OTM is experienced in head and face. LKM-transcripts contain the most vocabulary related to socio-affective processes. LKM is associated to love, sensations around the heart, and warmth. The LKM-outcomes were replicated with another independent set of MpI. These findings verify the merit of MpI as a scientific tool to gain reliable first-person data beyond questionnaires or rating scales.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of a Meditation Mobile App Intervention for Adolescent and Young Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable group with unique emotional, social, and practical needs due to the intersection of cancer survivorship and normal developmental processes. Mindfulness meditation has shown early efficacy in improving psychological distress among cancer patients. However, the overall scientific study of app-based mindfulness-based interventions is still in its early stages. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a commercially available mindfulness mobile app intervention "Ten Percent Happier" among AYA survivors of childhood cancer.METHODS: We conducted a single-arm pilot intervention with 25 AYA survivors of childhood cancer ages 18-29 years.RESULTS: A total of 108 potentially eligible individuals were initially identified for screening. Of the 45 individuals reached (contact rate = 41.67%), 20 declined to participate; 25 were enrolled in the study and completed the baseline survey (enrollment rate = 55.56%). Twenty-one participants completed the study (retention rate = 84%). Changes in several outcomes were promising, with medium to large effect sizes: Mindfulness (d = 0.74), Negative Emotion (d = 0.48), Perceived Stress (d = 0.52), and Mental Health (d = 0.45). Furthermore, results suggested that participants with consistent app usage showed greater improvement in reported outcomes than those who stopped their usage (e.g., Mindfulness: d = 0.74, Perceived Stress: d = 0.83, Mental Health: d = 0.51; Meaning and Purpose: d = 0.84; and Sleep Disturbance: d = 0.81). Qualitative feedback indicated high satisfaction, but participants suggested adding group or individual peer support to improve their experience with the app.CONCLUSIONS: AYA survivors can be difficult to reach, but a mindfulness app was feasible and acceptable to this group. In particular, the robust retention rate and high satisfaction ratings indicate that the meditation mobile app was well received. Preliminary results suggest positive changes in health-related quality of life outcomes, warranting a larger efficacy trial.

TI  - A randomized, controlled clinical trial: the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on generalized anxiety disorder among Chinese community patients: protocol for a randomized trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Research suggests that an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program may be effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders. Our objective is to compare the clinical effectiveness of the MBCT program with a psycho-education programme and usual care in reducing anxiety symptoms in people suffering from generalized anxiety disorder.Methods: A three armed randomized, controlled clinical trial including 9-month post-treatment follow-up is proposed. Participants screened positive using the Structure Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for general anxiety disorder will be recruited from community-based clinics. 228 participants will be randomly allocated to the MBCT program plus usual care, psycho-education program plus usual care or the usual care group. Validated Chinese version of instruments measuring anxiety and worry symptoms, depression, quality of life and health service utilization will be used. Our primary end point is the change of anxiety and worry score (Beck Anxiety Inventory and Penn State Worry Scale) from baseline to the end of intervention. For primary analyses, treatment outcomes will be assessed by ANCOVA, with change in anxiety score as the baseline variable, while the baseline anxiety score and other baseline characteristics that significantly differ between groups will serve as covariates.Conclusions: This is a first randomized controlled trial that compare the effectiveness of MBCT with an active control, findings will advance current knowledge in the management of GAD and the way that group intervention can be delivered and inform future research.

TI  - Lymphocyte Recovery After Breast Cancer Treatment and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Therapy
T2  - BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine immune recovery following breast cancer (BC) therapy and evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy (MBSR) on immune recovery with emphasis on lymphocyte subsets, T cell activation, and production of T-helper 1 (Th1; interferon [IFN]-gamma) and T-helper 2 (Th2; interleukin-4 [IL-4]) cytokines. Method: Participants who completed the study consisted of 82 patients diagnosed with Stage 0-III BC, who received lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation +/- chemotherapy. Patients were randomized into an MBSR(BC) intervention program or a control (usual care) group. Immune cell measures were assessed at baseline and within 2 weeks after the 6-week intervention. The numbers and percentages of lymphocyte subsets, activated T cells, and Th1 and Th2 cells in peripheral blood samples were determined by immunostaining and flow cytometry. Results: Immune subset recovery after cancer treatment showed positive associations with time since treatment completion. The B and natural killer (NK) cells were more susceptible than T cells in being suppressed by cancer treatment. Women who received MBSR(BC) had T cells more readily activated by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and an increase in the Th1/Th2 ratio. Activation was also higher for the MBSR(BC) group if <12 weeks from the end of treatment and women in MBSR(BC) <12 weeks had higher T cell count for CD4(+). Conclusion: MBSR(BC) promotes a more rapid recovery of functional T cells capable of being activated by a mitogen with the Th1 phenotype, whereas substantial recovery of B and NK cells after completion of cancer treatment appears to occur independent of stress-reducing interventions.

TI  - Burnout among physicians
T2  - LIBYAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Burnout is a common syndrome seen in healthcare workers, particularly physicians who are exposed to a high level of stress at work; it includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Burnout among physicians has garnered significant attention because of the negative impact it renders on patient care and medical personnel. Physicians who had high burnout levels reportedly committed more medical errors. Stress management programs that range from relaxation to cognitive-behavioral and patient-centered therapy have been found to be of utmost significance when it comes to preventing and treating burnout. However, evidence is insufficient to support that stress management programs can help reducing job-related stress beyond the intervention period, and similarly mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions efficiently reduce psychological distress and negative vibes, and encourage empathy while significantly enhancing physicians' quality of life. On the other hand, a few small studies have suggested that Balint sessions can have a promising positive effect in preventing burnout; moreover exercises can reduce anxiety levels and exhaustion symptoms while improving the mental and physical well-being of healthcare workers. Occupational interventions in the work settings can also improve the emotional and work-induced exhaustion. Combining both individual and organizational interventions can have a good impact in reducing burnout scores among physicians; therefore, multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the work environmental factors along with stress management programs that teach people how to cope better with stressful events showed promising solutions to manage burnout. However, until now there have been no rigorous studies to prove this. More interventional research targeting medical students, residents, and practicing physicians are needed in order to improve psychological well-being, professional careers, as well as the quality of care provided to patients.

TI  - The Divine States (<i>brahmaviharas</i>) in Managerial Ethical Decision-Making in Organisations in Sri Lanka: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethical decision-making (EDM) theories in behavioural ethics management have been developed through the social sciences, psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neurosciences. These theories are either cognitive, non-cognitive or an integration of both. Other scholars have recommended redefining what ethical means through moral philosophy and theology. Buddhism is a religion, a philosophy, a psychology, an ethical system and an art of living. The divine states (i.e. loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity) in Buddhism are virtues that could be developed by anyone regardless of their religion or non-religion through Buddhist meditation. They are so called because they enable individuals to develop 'God-like qualities'. The theoretical insights of the divine states indicate how to eliminate negative emotions, such as anger, fear, delusion and envy, by cultivating love and compassion towards both the self and others. Accordingly, this paper contributes to EDM by redefining what ethical means through the meanings managers who practise Buddhist meditation assign to divine states in their lived experience of EDM in organisations in Sri Lanka. The sample consisted of 17 Buddhists, 1 Hindu, 1 Muslim and 1 no-religion. Data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews and was analysed with IPA. The findings indicated that how the managers made meaning of an ethical decision was influenced by their loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. The findings also indicated that the managers justified the reasons for their decisions subsequently through the benefits to themselves as well as their employees. Accordingly, this study supports the view that EDM is an integrated approach.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation and the Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions Among Veterans Disorder
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a practice intended to enhance feelings of kindness and compassion for self and others.Objectives: To assess whether participation in a 12-week course of LKM for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with improved positive emotions, decentering, and personal resources.Research Design: In an open-pilot trial, veterans were assessed at baseline, after the course, and 3 months later. Effect sizes were calculated from baseline to each follow-up point for each construct of interest. Measures were chosen as an initial investigation of the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions.Subjects: A total of 42 veterans with active PTSD (40% female) participated.Measures: Emotions, decentering, psychological wellbeing including autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations, purpose in life, self-acceptance, and sense of social support were measured at each time point.Results: Significant increases in unactivated pleasant (d = 0.73), but not activated pleasant, emotions were found over time. Activated and unactivated unpleasant emotions decreased over time (d = -0.69 and -0.53, respectively). There were also increases in environmental mastery (d = 0.61), personal growth (d = 0.54), purpose in life (d = 0.71), self-acceptance (d = 0.68), and decentering (d = 0.96) at 3-month follow-up.Conclusions: Overall, positive emotions increased, and enhancement of personal resources occurred over time. Further investigation of LKM for PTSD is warranted.

TI  - In search of durable positive psychology interventions: Predictors and consequences of long-term positive behavior change
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of positive psychology interventions have successfully helped people learn skills for improving mood and building personal resources (e.g., psychological resilience and social support). However, little is known about whether intervention activities remain effective in the long term, or whether new resources are maintained after the intervention ends. We address these issues in a 15-month follow-up survey of participants from a loving-kindness meditation intervention. Many participants continued to practice meditation, and they reported more positive emotions (PEs) than those who had stopped meditating or had never meditated. All participants maintained gains in resources made during the initial intervention, whether or not they continued meditating. Continuing meditators did not differ on resources at baseline, but they did show more PE and a more rapid PE response to the intervention. Overall, our results suggest that positive psychology interventions are not just efficacious but of significant value in participants' real lives.

TI  - A Randomized Trial of 21 Days of Loving Kindness Meditation for Stress Reduction and Emotional Well-being Within an Online Health Community for Patients, Family, and Friends Experiencing a Cancer Health Journey
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: CaringBridge (CB) is an online health community for people undergoing challenging health journeys. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is a systemized mind-body approach developed to increase loving acceptance and has previously been reported to increase resilience in the face of adversity.Materials and Methods: Results of a randomized controlled trial of immediate compared with deferred 21-day LKM intervention in an online community are reported. The deferred group received LKM intervention after a waiting period of 3 weeks. Inclusion criteria were >18 years old, ability to understand English, willingness to participate in a mind-body practice, and use of CB for a cancer journey. Change in perceived stress, self-compassion, social connectedness and assurance, and compassionate love scales from baseline to 21 days was assessed.Results: Of the 979 participants included in the study, 649 (66%) provided 3-week follow-up data and 330 (49%) self-reported engaging in the LKM practice 5 or more days/week. Participants in the immediate LKM group reported medium effect size improvement in stress (0.4), self-compassion (0.5), and social connectedness (0.4) compared with the deferred LKM group. Changes in perceived stress and self-compassion were larger in magnitude and increased with more frequent engagement in LKM.Conclusions: The immediate LKM group showed improvements in stress, self-compassion, and social connectedness compared with the deferred control group. Differential study retention rates by treatment arm and self-reported engagement in LKM subject the results to selection bias. Future research of similar interventions within online health communities might pay greater attention to promoting intervention adherence and engaging a more diverse economic and racial/ethnic population.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05002842).

TI  - Patterns and predictors of adolescent engagement in a mindfulness-based social-emotional learning program
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise for promoting positive youth development, little is known about student engagement in MBIs. Initial research presents mixed findings in MBI engagement related to participant characteristics, and there is a lack of research examining the influence of context on engagement, despite the critical role context plays in academic engagement. This study examines the contribution of student demographic characteristics and classroom context to MBI engagement. Methods: Survey engagement data were collected at three time points from 106 ninth grade students (M-age = 14.17 years, 60.4% female, 44.2% Black, 24.8% Hispanic/Latino) who participated in the Be CALM program during the 2021-2022 school year. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine trajectory of student engagement and assess student and classroom predictors of engagement. Results: There was no overall change in the trajectory of student engagement, although variability was observed across classes. Identifying as Hispanic/Latino was associated with lower engagement (beta = -.25, p = .008), although this did not appear to be related to program experience. Peer connections predicted engagement at the end of the program (beta = .39, p < .001). Post hoc analyses suggested that student engagement may be related to teacher program delivery quality. Conclusions: Student engagement in MBIs appears related to classroom context more than student characteristics, although further research with larger samples is needed to assess the link between engagement and program outcomes. Findings have implications for designing school-based MBIs and training school staff to deliver them in culturally responsive ways.

TI  - Shift in Valence Bias Associated with Decrease in Trait Anxiety and Depression Symptoms
T2  - COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeMindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a well-known method for reducing stress and negative affect. Recently, a small, open-label trial showed that MBSR training was associated with a shift toward more positive responses to emotionally ambiguous signals (e.g., surprised expressions that convey either positive or negative meaning).MethodsHere, we test whether the MBSR-induced shift in responses to emotional ambiguity reported previously is accompanied by a reduction in self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms (n = 42).ResultsIn support of our hypothesis, we found that the degree to which individuals' post-training responses to emotional ambiguity became more positive was associated with the degree of reduction in post-training depression and anxiety symptoms (i.e., post-training symptoms controlling for pre-training symptoms; ps = 0.001). Importantly, the effect remains significant even when accounting for increases in self-reported mindfulness.ConclusionsAltogether, the results suggest that shifts in valence bias and reductions in internalizing symptoms track one another following MBSR, warranting future randomized, mechanistic investigations.

TI  - Behavioural interventions affecting global perceptions of control in people with parkinson's disease: a scoping review
T2  - DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposePerceived control is an important construct for the psychological well-being of people affected by chronic conditions, and higher perceived control is associated with better outcomes. Psychosocial interventions have been trialled in these populations to improve both global and specific perceptions of control. However, most interventions involving people with Parkinson's have focused on single-domain forms of control, while those addressing global perceived control are yet to be reviewed. This study aimed to identify and map the types of psychosocial interventions in individuals with Parkinson's which have included forms of global perceived control as an outcome.Materials and MethodsScoping review based on a search across MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Academic Search Ultimate.ResultsFrom an initial return of 4388 citations, 12 citations were eventually included. These consisted of 8 quantitative and 4 qualitative studies, and covered 4 overarching categories of psychosocial interventions. Mixed results were found for cognitive, educational, and physical interventions, while a randomised controlled trial on mindfulness-based lifestyle programme showed more preliminary positive evidence.ConclusionsFurther rigorous research is required on the topic to build on these preliminary findings. In the meantime, clinicians may need to consider programmes which proved effective with populations similar to people with Parkinson's.

AB  - Facets of positive psychologica well-being, such as optimism, have been identified as positive health assets because they are prospectively associated with the 7 metrics of cardiovascular health (CVH) and improved outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. Connections between psychological well-being and cardiovascular conditions may be mediated through biological, behavioral, and psychosocial pathways. Individual-Level interventions, such as mindfulness based programs and positive psychological interventions, have shown promise for modifying psychological well-being. Further, orkplaces are using well-being-focused interventions to promote employee CVH, and these interventions represent a potential model. for expanding psychological well-being programs to communities and societies. Given the relevance of psychological well-being to promoting CVH, this review outlines clinical recommendations to assess and promote wellbeing in encounters with patients. Finally, a research agenda is proposed. Additional prospective observational studies are needed to understand mechanisms underlying the connection between psychological well-being and cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, rigorous intervention trials are needed to assess whether psychological well-being-promoting programs can improve cardiovascular outcomes.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesNumerous studies have confirmed robust relationships between general well-being and mindfulness or character strengths, respectively, but few have examined associations between mindfulness and character strengths. Two studies were carried out to explore these relationships comprehensively in the framework of the Values in Action (VIA) classification of character strengths.MethodsIn study 1, participants (N=1335) completed validated assessments of mindfulness and character strengths, and the relationship between the two was investigated in a broad online sample. In study 2, the effect of a mindfulness training on specific character strengths was investigated using a randomized-control design (N=42).ResultsThe results of study 1 confirmed positive relationships between mindfulness and character strengths and further identified a list of character strengths that might overlap with mindfulnessi.e., creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, bravery, perseverance, zest, love, social intelligence, forgiveness, self-regulation, appreciation of beauty, gratitude, hope, and spirituality. The findings of study 2 provided further support for the hypothesis that mindfulness training could help cultivate certain character strengths. Compared with participants in the waitlist control condition, those who attended an 8-week mindfulness-based training program showed significant increases in the strengths of love, appreciation of beauty, gratitude, and spirituality, and a trend toward significant increases in the strengths of zest and bravery.ConclusionsThe results provide initial evidence for a mutual support model of mindfulness and character strengths.

TI  - Impact of a mindfulness-based intervention on undergraduate pharmacy students' stress and distress: Quantitative results of a mixed-methods study
T2  - CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Stress negatively impacts upon physical and mental health. Pharmacy students demonstrate higher stress than the general population. Mindfulness may improve pharmacy students' stress and distress levels. The purpose of this study was to assess the quantitative effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on pharmacy student stress, distress, burnout, and mindfulness levels.Methods: A quasi-randomised controlled trial was conducted at an Irish pharmacy school during the 2016 to 2017 academic year. The intervention group completed a four-week mindfulness course. The waitlist control group received only usual education. Participants completed a demographics form, the Perceived Stress Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Student Survey, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire at baseline and immediately post-intervention.Results: Full data were gathered and analysed for 99 students (51 intervention, 48 control, 66.7% female). There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline. Post-intervention, a large effect on mental distress was found (Partial Eta Squared 0.137) with the intervention group reporting statistically significantly lower distress than the control group (F (1,98) = 15.3, p < 0.005). Stress and distress were significantly improved for females (p = 0.026, p < 0.005), while males improved in the observing facet of mindfulness (p = 0.038). There was a positive association between attendance and these findings (r2 = 0.191, p < 0.005).Conclusion: Female pharmacy students experienced improvements in mental distress and stress after participation in the intervention. Mindfulness may have a future role to play in pharmacy and healthcare education.

TI  - The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Therapy on Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Cancer Patients and Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The use of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) in oncology settings has become increasingly popular, and research in the field has rapidly expanded. The objective was by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the current evidence for the effect of MBT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients and survivors. Method: Electronic databases were searched, and researchers were contacted for further relevant studies. Twenty-two independent studies with a total of 1,403 participants were included. Studies were coded for quality (range: 0-4), and overall effect size analyses were performed separately for nonrandomized studies (K = 13, n = 448) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs; K = 9, n = 955). Effect sizes were combined using the random-effects model. Results: In the aggregated sample of nonrandomized studies (average quality score: 0.5), MBT was associated with significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression from pre- to posttreatment corresponding to moderate effect sizes (Hedges's g) of 0.60 and 0.42, respectively. The pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges's g) of RCTs (average quality score: 2.9) were 0.37 for anxiety symptoms (p < .001) and 0.44 for symptoms of depression (p < .001). These effect sizes appeared robust. Furthermore, in RCTs, MBT significantly improved mindfulness skills (Hedges's g = 0.39). Conclusion: While the overall quality of existing clinical trials varies considerably, there appears to be some positive evidence from relatively high-quality RCTs to support the use of MBT for cancer patients and survivors with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

TI  - Emotionally aligned: Preliminary results on the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention for depression on congruence between implicit and explicit mood
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in treating major depression. Because mindfulness involves monitoring and accepting current experiences, it may lead people resolve incongruencies between emotional responses that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Mindfulness may thus foster congruence between implicit and explicit emotions. The current randomized controlled trial tested this notion. Methods N = 39 patients with an acute depressive episode were randomly assigned to an 8-week MBI (n = 24) or a psychopharmacological consultation condition (n = 15). Explicit and implicit mood and depressive symptoms were assessed before treatment and at the end of treatment. Results Compared with the control condition, patients receiving MBI demonstrated higher congruence between implicit and explicit negative mood after treatment. There was no such difference in congruence of implicit and explicit positive mood. Additional analyses showed that only within the MBI group, individual differences in explicit mood became less stable. In contrast, individual differences in implicit mood remained stable in both groups. Limitations There was no control group including an active psychological intervention, the sample was small, and emotional congruence was not assessed within persons. Conclusions These findings correspond with the idea that mindfulness reduces incongruencies between implicit and explicit emotional responses. We found preliminary evidence for this effect for negative emotional responses. There was suggestive evidence that congruence arose from the alignment of explicit responses (which became less stable) to implicit responses (which remained stable). Studying the interplay between implicit and explicit processes may shed light on the working mechanisms of clinical-psychological interventions.

TI  - Feasibility of mindfulness-based therapy in patients recovering from a first psychotic episode: a pilot study
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Recently, a mindfulness therapy for people with psychotic disorders was developed. However, clinicians and researchers are cautious given case reports in which extensive meditation provoked psychotic symptoms in people with a psychotic disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, adverse effects and possible favourable effects of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) in people recently recovering from a first episode of psychosis. Method: A nonrandomized, non-controlled prospective follow-up study. Patients were offered an MBT that consisted of eight 1-hour sessions within a 4-week time span. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Symptoms Checklist 90 and the Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire were assessed before and after the therapy. Results: Of the 16 persons who started MBT, 13 completed (81.5%) the therapy. No significant increase in psychotic symptoms was found. Between two meetings, one participant initially misunderstood the mindfulness instructions, which led to an increase in distress. No increased awareness of intrusive thoughts or visual or auditory hallucinations was reported by participants. We found a decrease in agoraphobic symptoms (p < 0.028) and in psychoneuroticism (P < 0.025). Conclusion: The MBT had no significant adverse effect on psychotic symptoms in patients in this small pilot study, neither did it raise the level of mindfulness in the participants. A decrease in psychological symptoms was found, although one patient experienced an increase in symptoms of distress. Our study demonstrates that therapists should be cautious that therapy and practice instructions are understood properly. Future studies are feasible and needed, in larger samples with an RCT design, in order to draw conclusions regarding the effects of the MBT.

TI  - Long-term improvements after mindfulness-based group therapy of depression, anxiety and stress and adjustment disorders: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although mindfulness-based group therapies (MGTs) for depressive, anxiety or stress and adjustment disorders are promising, there is a substantial lack of knowledge regarding the long-term improvements after such therapies in these common psychiatric disorders. Methods Two hundred and fifteen patients were randomized in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) ( ID: NCT01476371) conducted in 2012 at 16 primary healthcare centres in southern Sweden. The patients were randomized to MGT or treatment as usual (TAU) and completed four psychometric self-rated scales after 8 weeks of treatment. Approximately 12 months after the completion of the 8-week treatment, the same scales were repeated. Ordinal and generalized linear-mixed models, adjusted for cluster effects, were used for the analysis. Results For all four psychometric scales (MADRS-S [Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale-S], HADS-D, HADS-A [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale A and D] and PHQ-9 [Patient Health Questionnaire-9]) the scores at the 1-year follow-up were significantly improved (all P values <0.001) in both groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the MGT and TAU in the psychometric scores at the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT comparing the long-term improvements after MGT with TAU. Although it cannot be excluded that our findings are a result of the natural course of common psychiatric disorders or other factors, they suggest a long-term positive improvement after both MGT and TAU.

TI  - How Does MBCT for Depression Work? Studying Cognitive and Affective Mediation Pathways
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce current symptoms and to prevent recurrence of major depressive disorder. At present, it is not well understood which underlying mechanisms during MBCT are associated with its efficacy. The current study (n = 130) was designed to examine the roles of mindfulness skills, rumination, worry and affect, and the interplay between those factors, in the mechanisms of change in MBCT for residual depressive symptoms. An exploratory but systematic approach was chosen using Sobel-Goodman mediation analyses to identify mediators on the pathway from MBCT to reduction in depressive symptoms. We replicated earlier findings that therapeutic effects of MBCT are mediated by changes in mindfulness skills and worry. Second, results showed that changes in momentary positive and negative affect significantly mediated the efficacy of MBCT, and also mediated the effect of worry on depressive symptoms. Third, within the group of patients with a prior history of <= 2 episodes of MDD, predominantly changes in cognitive and to a lesser extent affective processes mediated the effect of MBCT. However, within the group of patients with a prior history of >= 3 episodes of MDD, only changes in affect were significant mediators for the effect of MBCT.Trail Registration: Nederlands Trial Register NTR1084

TI  - The eCALM Trial-eTherapy for cancer appLying mindfulness: online mindfulness-based cancer recovery program for underserved individuals living with cancer in Alberta: protocol development for a randomized wait-list controlled clinical trial
T2  - BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Elevated stress can exacerbate cancer symptom severity, and after completion of primary cancer treatments, many individuals continue to have significant distress. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is an 8-week group psychosocial intervention consisting of training in mindfulness meditation and yoga designed to mitigate stress, pain, and chronic illness. Efficacy research shows face-to-face (F2F) MBCR programs have positive benefits for cancer patients; however barriers exist that impede participation in F2F groups. While online MBCR groups are available to the public, none have been evaluated. Primary objective: determine whether underserved patients are willing to participate in and complete an online MBCR program. Secondary objectives: determine whether online MBCR will mirror previous efficacy findings from F2F MBCR groups on patient-reported outcomes.Method/design: The study includes cancer patients in Alberta, exhibiting moderate distress, who do not have access to F2F MBCR. Participants will be randomized to either online MBCR, or waiting for the next available group. An anticipated sample size of 64 participants will complete measures online pre and post treatment or waiting period. Feasibility will be tracked through monitoring numbers eligible and participating through each stage of the protocol.Discussion: 47 have completed/completing the intervention. Data suggest it is possible to conduct a randomized waitlist controlled trial of online MBCR to reach underserved cancer survivors.

TI  - Differential effects of mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and loving-kindness meditation on decentering and negative reactions to repetitive thoughts
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decentering has been proposed as a potential mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions but has received limited empirical examination to date in experimental studies comparing mindfulness meditation to active comparison conditions. In the present study, we compared the immediate effects of mindful breathing (MB) to two alternative stress-management techniques: progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) to test whether decentering is unique to mindfulness meditation or common across approaches. Novice meditators (190 female undergraduates) were randomly assigned to complete one of three 15-min stress-management exercises (MB, PMR, or LKM) presented by audio recording. Immediately after the exercise, participants completed measures of decentering, frequency of repetitive thoughts during the exercise, and degree of negative reaction to thoughts. As predicted, participants in the MB condition reported greater decentering relative to the other two conditions. The association between frequency of repetitive thought and negative reactions to thoughts was relatively weaker in the MB condition than in the PMR and LKM conditions, in which these two variables were strongly and positively correlated. Consistent with the construct of decentering, the relative independence between these two variables in the MB condition suggests that mindful breathing may help to reduce reactivity to repetitive thoughts. Taken together, results help to provide further evidence of decentering as a potential mechanism that distinguishes mindfulness practice from other credible stress-management approaches.

TI  - Program evaluation of a school-based mental health and wellness curriculum featuring yoga and mindfulness
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Interest in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga in primary schools has grown. Evidence shows promise, as youth who engage in yoga to promote mindfulness show improved coping skills, increased socio-emotional competence and prosocial skills, academic performance, attention span, and ability to deal with stress.Objective This study reports the results of a program evaluation of a universal health and wellness curriculum, Pure Power, designed to teach youth yoga techniques, mindfulness, and emotion regulation.Methods A non-randomized comparison design examined outcomes among participants from schools that completed the intervention with highest fidelity of implementation (n = 461) and from students in matched comparison schools (n = 420). Standard measures of coping, emotion regulation and emotion dysregulation, spelling, and math achievement were collected.Results Analyses suggest the youth in the intervention schools demonstrated relative improvement on measures of emotion regulation, spelling, and math.Conclusions Challenges in implementation in real-life settings are vital to identify. The data provide some real-world evidence for the effectiveness of a universal health and wellness curriculum on emotion regulation and positive academic outcomes. Training school staff to deliver the intervention may foster implementation. Future research should test the effectiveness of who delivers the intervention; for example, teacher-delivered groups vs. other wellness personnel.

TI  - Feasibility and Preliminary Outcomes of a School-Based Mindfulness Intervention for Urban Youth
T2  - JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Youth in underserved, urban communities are at risk for a range of negative outcomes related to stress, including social-emotional difficulties, behavior problems, and poor academic performance. Mindfulness-based approaches may improve adjustment among chronically stressed and disadvantaged youth by enhancing self-regulatory capacities. This paper reports findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a school-based mindfulness and yoga intervention. Four urban public schools were randomized to an intervention or wait-list control condition (n = 97 fourth and fifth graders, 60.8% female). It was hypothesized that the 12-week intervention would reduce involuntary stress responses and improve mental health outcomes and social adjustment. Stress responses, depressive symptoms, and peer relations were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Findings suggest the intervention was attractive to students, teachers, and school administrators and that it had a positive impact on problematic responses to stress including rumination, intrusive thoughts, and emotional arousal.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This exploratory study is the first systematic outcome evaluation to examine the effects of an 8-week meditation-based program in mindfulness in a German sample.DESIGN: Twenty-one (21) participants with chronic physical, psychologic, or psychosomatic illnesses were examined in a longitudinal pretest and post-treatment design with a 3-month follow-up.OUTCOME MEASURES: Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. Emotional and general physical well-being, sense of coherence, overall psychologic distress, and satisfaction with life were measured with standardized instruments.RESULTS: Overall, the interventions led to high levels of adherence to the meditation practice and satisfaction with the benefits of the course, as well as effective and lasting reductions of symptoms (especially in psychologic distress, well-being, and quality of life). Changes were of moderate-to-large effect sizes. Positive complementary effects with psychotherapy were also found.CONCLUSIONS: These findings warrant controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction as an intervention for chronic physical and psychosomatic disorders in Germany.

TI  - Increasing Self-Compassion: Review of the Literature and Recommendations.
T2  - Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Depression is a common symptom among college students and is often accompanied by negative thoughts about oneself. Self-compassion is a technique students can use to combat those negative thoughts. Self-compassion is an emotion-regulation strategy in which the individual engages in self-kindness, particularly after a mistake, failure, and/or rejection. This paper reviews the concept of self-compassion, assessment of self-compassion, and interventions that have been shown to increase self-compassion. Self-compassion is associated with lower levels of psychopathology and higher levels of well-being. It is theorized to work by buffering against a self-critical ruminative process after a mistake, failure, and/or rejection. Self-compassion is most commonly assessed through a validated scale that measures overall self-compassion and its six subscales: self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification. Multiple self-compassion interventions have been shown to increase self-compassion and improve psychological health. These interventions are varied and contain strategies such as mindfulness meditation, loving kindness meditation, and changing self-talk. Details of those interventions and practical strategies that individuals, students, and professors can use to increase self-compassion are described. Overall, self-compassion is a valuable tool that can help individuals cope with mistakes, failure, and/or rejection.

TI  - Community Needs Assessment among Latino Families in an Urban Public Housing Development
T2  - HISPANIC JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies examining the health of public housing residents are limited. In response, community-based participatory research principles were used to develop an intervention aimed at improving health outcomes related to multifactorial risk behaviors among Latino families living in a low-income neighborhood. A two-part needs assessment was completed to guide the intervention: interviews with parents (n = 10) and a group model building (GMB) workshop with youth and parents (n = 40) to explore the parent-youth dynamic. Interviews indicated that poverty, youth disobedience, and inadequate communication between parents and youth led to parental stress. During the workshop, balancing and reinforcing feedback loops involving Communication, Trust, and Respect between youth and parents were identified. Based on these findings and collaboration with a community advisory board, a bilingual, mindfulness-based meditation intervention was designed to address community needs: positive parent-child interaction emphasizing trust and communication, stress reduction, and family well-being.

T2  - MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Mindfulness has been defined as being intentionally aware of internal and external experiences that occur at the present moment, without judgment. Techniques that develop mindfulness, such as meditation, have positive effects on reducing insomnia, a sleep disorder that is common both during and after menopause. Our aim was to establish whether postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than postmenopausal women without sleep disorders.Methods Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years who did not use hormone therapy were recruited for the study. The sample included 14 women with insomnia and 12 women without insomnia or any other sleep disorder. The groups were comparable in age, schooling, and anxiety level. To assess mindfulness, we used the validated Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the attentiveness domain of the Positive and Negative Affect ScheduleExpanded Form.Results Participants with insomnia were less mindful than healthy women. The level of mindfulness was able to discriminate the group with insomnia from the healthy group, with 71.4% accuracy.Conclusions Postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than women without insomnia. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as meditation, may be beneficial for postmenopausal insomnia.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness meditations (LKM) have not been examined within a parenting context, which is surprising given that LKM helps to build social relationships and connectedness through promoting caring pro-social behavior. This study examined the effects of LKM in a parenting context, using a fifteen-minute audio-guided LKM. In a group-based design micro trial, a total of 61 parents (50 female, mean age = 38.41 years, SD = 6.11) were randomly assigned to receive a LKM or a matched control focused imagery (FI) exercise. Participants completed a series of measures that examined compassion, parenting and child behavior, and parent's emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses to a set of six hypothetical vignettes describing difficult child behavior. We also assessed for parents' acceptability towards LKM as a strategy. As predicted, parents who received LKM displayed higher levels of self-compassion and motivation to show themselves compassion compared to the control group; however not compassion towards others. Parents in the LKM compared to the FI group also had more positive (e.g., calm and sympathetic) and less negative emotional (e.g., frustration and anger) responses to the situations of childhood distress; however, parent's cognitive and behavioral responses did not significantly change. Parent's also found LKM to be highly acceptable, with 60% indicating they would complete it weekly. The present findings suggest that LKM might be a valuable component to include in evidence-based parenting interventions.

TI  - Influence on Forgiveness, Character Strengths and Satisfaction with Life of a Short Mindfulness Intervention via a Spanish Smartphone Application
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) are a recognized effective psychological practice characterized by attention control, awareness, acceptance, non-reactivity, and non-judgmental thinking obtained through the practice of meditation. They have been shown to be useful in reducing stress and enhancing well-being in different contexts. In this research, the effectiveness of an MBI was evaluated on variables that can promote successful job performance such as mindfulness trait, positive and negative affect, forgiveness, personality strengths and satisfaction with life. The intervention was carried out through a smartphone application called "Aire Fresco" (Fresh Air) during 14 days in the middle of the quarantine produced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study sample was composed of 164 Spanish people who were distributed in two groups: control group and experimental group, which were evaluated before and after the intervention. The MANCOVA performed showed an overall positive effect of the intervention on the variables evaluated. The different ANCOVAs carried out showed that the intervention was beneficial in increasing mindfulness trait, reducing negative affect or increasing life satisfaction, among others. Our study is, as far as we know, the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of a brief intervention in mindfulness conducted using a smartphone application in Spanish.

TI  - Acute effects of meditation training on the waking and sleeping brain: Is it all about homeostasis?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our recent finding of a meditation-related increase in low-frequency NREM sleep EEG oscillatory activities peaking in the theta-alpha range (4-12 Hz) was not predicted. From a consolidated body of research on sleep homeostasis, we would expect a change peaking in slow wave activity (1-4 Hz) following an intense meditation session. Here we compared these changes in sleep with the post-meditation changes in waking rest scalp power to further characterize their functional significance. High-density EEG recordings were acquired from 27 long-term meditators (LTM) on three separate days at baseline and following two 8-hr sessions of either mindfulness or compassion-and-loving-kindness meditation. Thirty-one meditation-naive participants (MNP) were recorded at the same time points. As a common effect of meditation practice, we found increases in low and fast waking EEG oscillations for LTM only, peaking at eight and 15 Hz respectively, over prefrontal, and left centro-parietal electrodes. Paralleling our previous findings in sleep, there was no significant difference between meditation styles in LTM as well as no difference between matched sessions in MNP. Meditation-related changes in wakefulness and NREM sleep were correlated across space and frequency. A significant correlation was found in the EEG low frequencies (<12 Hz). Since the peak of coupling was observed in the theta-alpha oscillatory range, sleep homeostatic response to meditation practice is not sufficient to explain our findings. Another likely phenomenon into play is a reverberation of meditation-related processes during subsequent sleep. Future studies should ascertain the interplay between these processes in promoting the beneficial effects of meditation practice.

TI  - A New Micro-Intervention to Increase the Enjoyment and Continued Practice of Meditation
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - New health behaviors are difficult to maintain and meditation is no different. We tested two key pathways of the upward spiral theory of lifestyle change (Fredrickson, 2013), which identifies positive emotions as critical ingredients for the maintenance of new health behaviors. The present experiment combined a laboratory session that introduced novices to meditation with a 3-week follow-up period to assess the extent to which study participants maintained this new health behavior. In a 2 x 2 experimental design, midlife adults (N = 240) were randomized to (a) learn about judicious ways to prioritize positivity (labeled "prioritizing positivity plus") or about a control topic that also featured the science of positive emotions and (b) follow a guided meditation based on either loving-kindness, which provided an opportunity to self-generate positive emotions, or mindfulness, which did not. All participants rated their emotions following the initial guided meditation and reported, week by week, whether they meditated during the ensuing 21 days. Analyses revealed that being exposed to the prioritizing positivity plus microintervention, relative to a control passage, amplified the effect of engaging in loving-kindness (vs. mindfulness) meditation on positive emotions. Additionally, the degree to which participants experienced positive emotions during first exposure to either meditation type predicted the frequency and duration at which they practiced meditation over the next 21 days. These findings show that the enjoyment of meditation can be experimentally amplified and that initial enjoyment predicts continued practice. Discussion spotlights the importance of differentiating effective and ineffective ways to pursue happiness.

TI  - Effects of a Mental Health Intervention in Athletes: Applying Self-Determination Theory
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Many sport associations have responded to mental health issues in sport through the inclusion of self-management programs, such as mindfulness training, which may improve well-being through increasing one's competence in self-regulating stressors. Yet, the mechanisms accounting such changes lack a theoretical basis, particularly in athletes.Aim: To determine the effect of a mental health intervention comprising a mindfulness program for promoting well-being, reducing stress, and increasing competence in mental health self-management. This is the first study among athletes to test the mechanisms of change in a mindfulness program using Self-Determination Theory (SDT).Methods: A 2 (groups) x 2 (time-point) non-randomized controlled trial was conducted, and between-groups baseline differences were firstly assessed. Two competing regression models assessing singular and serial indirect mediating mechanisms were conducted, in which mindfulness (Model 1) and competence satisfaction (Model 2) were both tested as primary and secondary mediators predicting change scores in stress and well-being. Demographic variables (i.e., gender, age) were controlled for in the analyses.Results: Two hundred and thirty-eight student athletes (mean age = 20.47 years, SD = 3.30, 57.6% = males) participated, with 108 in the intervention group who received an instructional workshop, and a home-directed mindfulness program comprising daily meditation sessions. No baseline differences were found between intervention and control groups. In Model 1, mindfulness was not directly enhanced by the intervention, subsequently resulting in no indirect effects on competence, stress and well-being. In Model 2, the intervention was directly related to positive changes in competence (beta= 0.39, p < 0.05), subsequently resulting in indirect effects on mindfulness awareness (beta = 0.07, p < 0.05), stress (beta = -0.06, p < 0.05), and well-being (beta = 0.05, p < 0.05). In addition, serial indirect effects for the intervention on stress were present through competence and mindfulness awareness in sequence (beta = -0.02, p < 0.05), and; on well-being through competence, mindfulness awareness, and stress in sequence (beta= 0.01, p < 0.05; R-2 = 0.54).Conclusion: Mindfulness-based mental health interventions may be effective at reducing stress and promoting well-being in athletes, with the caveat that attention is given to the inclusion of mental health competence promotion in program design. However, it remains unclear whether increasing mindfulness itself can exert additional salutary effects. Our findings have an important bearing on how mindfulness programs are developed within athlete mental health interventions.

TI  - The Four Immeasurables Meditations: Differential Effects of Appreciative Joy and Compassion Meditations on Emotions
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The four immeasurables meditations (FIMs) cultivate four different attitudes in Buddhism. However, in psychological research, these meditations have been combined and their differences have not been directly evaluated. The current study provided the first comparison between appreciative joy meditation (AJM) and compassion meditation (CM). Ninety college students were allocated to three groups which included AJM, CM, and neutral facial visualization in a laboratory setting. The students were asked to practice corresponding meditations for friends followed by that for strangers. The self-reported emotions were measured before and after the meditations for different targets, and the emotional Stroop task was administered following the meditation for friends. The major findings included the following: (1) AJM and CM for strangers enhanced other-focused positive emotions (e.g., love) compared with the control group, indicating both AJM and CM promote pro-socialness. (2) Compared with the other conditions, CM for friends and for strangers increased sadness and CM for friends decreased happiness and overall positive emotional valence, whereas AJM for strangers enhanced happiness and overall positive emotional valence, suggesting that the two FIMs had different effects on emotional valence. (3) There were no significant interactions for self-focused positive emotions (e.g., pride) or interpersonal negative emotions (e.g., envy), but AJM exhibited a potential effect on the suppression of interpersonal negative emotions compared with the other conditions. (4) No significant interaction was found for low arousal positive emotions (e.g., calm) and overall arousal. (5) Findings from the Stroop task indicated that AJM tended to result in longer reaction times compared with the other groups, and daily appreciative joy also affected the reaction times. These findings indicate that FIMs should be differentiated in psychological research because of their different effects. The potential mechanisms underlying the effects of FIMs and their implications for research and practice of FIMs were also discussed.

TI  - "Breathe in ... breathe out": Contextualizing the Rise of Mindfulness in Canadian Schools
T2  - HISTORICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION-CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness practices have exploded onto the mainstream North American cultural landscape. Not surprisingly, proponents of mindfulness can also be found within education systems in North America and the western world more generally. In Canada, mindfulness-based programs have filtered into faculties of education as well as public school classrooms. Yet, despite the rapid spread of the mindfulness movement, relatively little is known about it historically. This article pieces together some of the key intellectual and cultural developments that have enabled the growth of this phenomenon: North Americans' encounters with Buddhist perspectives since the 1950s and 1960s, the intersection of psychology and Buddhist practice, the flourishing of progressive educational ideals, and the growth of school psychology. It then briefly explores the kinds of citizenship ideals promoted by mindfulness practices as well as educators' rationales for their implementation. Tracing this history demonstrates that, despite its relatively recent entry into schools and its promotion as a scientifically-based physiological practice, mindfulness is a phenomenon with deep historical roots within a particular British and North American social and cultural context. Exploring this context and the reasons for educators' turn to mindfulness will help us better understand our modern education system and the kinds of students it aims to produce.

TI  - Psychological Interventions in the Treatment of Chronic Itch
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Patients with chronic itch suffer from higher levels of depression and anxiety than their healthy counterparts. Furthermore, psychological factors, such as stress, are known to aggravate itch. The mere act of thinking about itching can induce the sensation. Interventions like habit reversal training and arousal reduction have been shown to have positive effects on itch relief. Yet, there is still limited data on the psychological management to control the itch scratch cycle and a description of methods suitable to address itch. In this review, we describe different psychological interventions shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic itch. We also provide suggestions based on our experience of suitable interventions for patients with different types of itch.

TI  - Mindfulness Training for Coaches: A Mixed-Method Exploratory Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based research in sport has focused on athletes, while coaches remain unexplored. Research consistently shows that coaches experience high stress, which can lead to burnout, reduced performance, and emotional mismanagement. The present study developed and explored Mindfulness Training for Coaches (MTC), which is aimed at increasing mindfulness and emotional stability while reducing anxiety. Participants were 20 Division I coaches. The mixed-method design included trait and state measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and emotion, along with qualitative semistructured interviews. Trained coaches reported significantly less anxiety and greater emotional stability from pre- to posttraining. The state measures showed trained coaches were lower in anxiety and adverse emotions at each time point. Interviews showed six distinct positive impacts on coaches: anxiety and stress; emotions; mindfulness; coaching; athletes; and personal life. MTC is a promising intervention for coaches to reduce stress, improve well-being, and enhance coach-athlete interactions.

T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was to examine the construct of Lovingkindness-Compassion and to development of the Lovingkindness-Compassion Scale (LCS). Five Buddhist monks were interviewed for a definition of lovingkindness-compassion. Based on their responses, potential items related to the LCS were created. This study analyzed the validity and reliability of the LCS in a sample of 469 university students. The results showed a three-factor structure using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as confirmatory factor analysis (CFA): compassion, lovingkindness, and self-centeredness. Also, the results indicated that the LCS was significantly correlated with self-compassion, compassionate love, social connectedness, empathy and satisfaction with life. This study supported the reliability and validity of the LCS to measure lovingkindness-compassion.

TI  - The protective effect of mindfulness and compassion meditation practices on ageing: Hypotheses, models and experimental implementation
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a major health and societal issue; there is no treatment to date and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease are not well understood. Yet, there is hope that AD risk factors and thus the number of AD cases can be significantly reduced by prevention measures based on lifestyle modifications as targeted by non-pharmacological preventive interventions. So far, these interventions have rarely targeted the psycho-affective risk factors related to depression, stress, anxiety, and feeling of loneliness, which are all prevalent in ageing. This paper presents the hypothesis that the regular practice of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) in the ageing population constitutes a lifestyle that is protective against AD. In this model, these practices can promote cognition, mental health, and well-being by strengthening attention control, metacognitive monitoring, emotion regulation and pro-social capacities. Training these capacities could reduce the risk of AD by upregulating beneficial age-related factors such as cognitive reserve, and down-regulating detrimental age-related factors, such as stress, or depression. As an illustration, we present the Medit-Ageing study (public name Silver Sante ' Study), an on-going European project that assesses the impact and mechanisms of non-pharmacological interventions including meditation, in the ageing population.

TI  - The Mediating Effects of Coping Style on the Effects of Breath Count Mindfulness Training on Depressive Symptoms among International Students in China
T2  - NEURAL PLASTICITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness training has gained popularity in the scientific field and has been proposed as an efficient way for emotional regulation. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is designed especially for depressive people in reducing risk of depression relapse and is recommended in national guidelines as a treatment choice for relapse prevention in recurrent depression. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness training on depressive symptoms of international students and probe into the mediating role of mindfulness in stressful events and depression. In addition, we introduced a new kind of mindfulness training, the breathing exercise-based mindfulness training, which is based on the integration of Buddhism and Daoism. Self-report questionnaires assessing the coping style, abnormal depressive behavior, and stressful live events were completed in 260 international students in China (mean age=21.4years). The results showed that (1) many international students showed depression symptoms, (2) stressful life events play a completely mediating role in the initiation of depression and anxiety, and (3) mindfulness training for 8 weeks significantly reduced the depressive symptoms, and it was also related to a positive coping style. This study has certain theoretical significance in exploring the mechanism of the occurrence and development of depression among international students and provides useful tools for this special group of international students. In addition, the international students can also learn Chinese culture through the training. These findings indicate that mindfulness training and positive coping style are interrelated with treating depressive symptoms for international students.

TI  - The Theoretical and Empirical Basis for Meditation as an Intervention for PTSD
T2  - BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of the existence of good empirically supported treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), consumers and providers continue to ask for more options for managing this common and often chronic condition. Meditation-based approaches are being widely implemented, but there is minimal research rigorously assessing their effectiveness. This article reviews meditation as an intervention for PTSD, considering three major types of meditative practices: mindfulness, mantra, and compassion meditation. The mechanisms by which these approaches may effectively reduce PTSD symptoms and improve quality of life are presented. Empirical evidence of the efficacy of meditation for PTSD is very limited but holds some promise. Additional evaluation of meditation-based treatment appears to be warranted.

TI  - The Benefits of Loving Kindness Meditation for Helping Professionals: A Systematic Review
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Helping professionals are at risk of experiencing adverse health and psychological problems when working in roles where they are continually exposed to the emotional distress of others. The term compassion fatigue was coined to describe symptoms of emotional and physical fatigue experienced by workers in these environments. However, empirical research contends that compassion does not cause fatigue, rather compassion is said to foster well-being and is neurologically rejuvenating. The objective of this review was to examine the scientific literature which investigated the compassion-enhancing practice of loving kindness meditation (LKM). This review suggests that LKM can be seen as an alternate strategy to reduce stress, ease empathic distress, and increase positive affect.

TI  - Prenatal stress self-help mindfulness intervention via social media: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Prenatal stress is a pressing issue. However, there is a lack of robust evidence for psychosocial interventions to manage this problem. Aims This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention on reducing prenatal stress compared to participation in health education groups. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a prenatal clinic of comprehensive tertiary care from April to October 2017. A total of 108 pregnant women were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Participants completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, fatigue, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness before, immediately after, and 15 weeks after the 4-week intervention period. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the intervention outcomes. Results The results supported greater improvement in terms of perceived stress (Wald chi(2)=26.94, p<0.001), fatigue (Wald chi(2)=17.61, p<0.001), positive affect (Wald chi(2)=9.03, p = 0.011), negative affect (Wald chi(2)=11.37, p = 0.003), and mindfulness (Wald chi(2)=24.97, p<0.001) in the intervention group than in the control group. Conclusions The self-help mindfulness intervention decreased prenatal stress and negative affect and improved positive affect and mindfulness.

TI  - A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial for a Videoconference-Delivered Mindfulness-Based Group Intervention in a Nonclinical Setting
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Technology is increasingly being integrated into the provision of therapy and mental health interventions. While the evidence base for technology-led delivery of mindfulness-based interventions is growing, one approach to understand the effects of technology-delivered elements includes programs that retain some aspects of traditional face-to-face interaction. This arrangement offers unique practical advantages, and also enables researchers to isolate variables that may be underlying the effects of technology-delivered interventions. The present study reports on a pilot videoconference-delivered mindfulness-based group intervention offered to university students and staff members with wait-list controls. Apart from the first session of the 6-week course, the main facilitator guided evening classes remotely via online videoconferencing, with follow-up exercises via email. Participants were taught a variety of mindfulness-based exercises such as meditation, breathing exercises, and mindful tasting, as well as the concepts underpinning such practice. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires on depression, anxiety, repetitive negative thinking, dysfunctional attitudes, positive and negative affect, self-compassion, compassion for others, and mindfulness. For participants who attended at least five of the six sessions, scores on all outcome measures improved significantly post-intervention and remained stable at 3-week follow-up. The videoconference-delivered mindfulness-based group intervention appears to provide a viable alternative format to standard mindfulness programs where the facilitator and participants need to live in close physical proximity with each other.

TI  - The DARE study of relapse prevention in depression: design for a phase 1/2 translational randomised controlled trial involving mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and supported self monitoring
T2  - BMC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Depression is a common condition that typically has a relapsing course. Effective interventions targeting relapse have the potential to dramatically reduce the point prevalence of the condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based intervention that has shown efficacy in reducing depressive relapse. While trials of MBCT to date have met the core requirements of phase 1 translational research, there is a need now to move to phase 2 translational research - the application of MBCT within real-world settings with a view to informing policy and clinical practice. The aim of this trial is to examine the clinical impact and health economics of MBCT under real-world conditions and where efforts have been made to assess for and prevent resentful demoralization among the control group. Secondary aims of the project involve extending the phase 1 agenda to an examination of the effects of co-morbidity and mechanisms of action.Methods/Design: This study is designed as a prospective, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a group comparison design between involving the intervention, MBCT, and a self-monitoring comparison condition, Depression Relapse Active Monitoring (DRAM). Follow-up is over 2 years. The design of the study indicates recruitment from primary and secondary care of 204 participants who have a history of 3 or more episodes of Major Depression but who are currently well. Measures assessing depressive relapse/recurrence, time to first clinical intervention, treatment expectancy and a range of secondary outcomes and process variables are included. A health economics evaluation will be undertaken to assess the incremental cost of MBCT.Discussion: The results of this trial, including an examination of clinical, functional and health economic outcomes, will be used to assess the role that this treatment approach may have in recommendations for treatment of depression in Australia and elsewhere. If the findings are positive, we expect that this research will consolidate the evidence base to guide the decision to fund MBCT and to seek to promote its availability to those who have experienced at least 3 episodes of depression.

TI  - Effectiveness of a nurse-led Mindfulness-based Tai Chi Chuan (MTCC) program on Posttraumatic Growth and perceived stress and anxiety of breast cancer survivors
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background With the development of positive psychology, posttraumatic growth research on cancer patients has attracted increasing attention from researchers. It is immensely important to effectively increase the posttraumatic growth level of cancer patients and improve their quality of life. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of a nurse-led mindfulness-based Tai Chi Chuan (MTCC) programme for increasing posttraumatic growth (PTG) and decreasing the perceived stress and anxiety of breast cancer survivors. Methods A RCT was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to either the MTCC group or the control group. The programme included 59 women with stage I-III breast cancer. Participants in the intervention group participated in a nurse-led 8-week, twice a week, one-hour per day mindfulness-based exercise programme. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured three times (T1 - before intervention; T2 - after intervention; T3 - one year after intervention) using validated scales, including the PTG inventory (PTGI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). A repeated-measure analysis of variance model was used to analyse the data. Results Compared with the wait-list control group, the PTG level in the MTCC group was much higher after the 8-week intervention and the follow-up (F = 374.98, P < .000). The results showed that MTCC increased the level of PTG, and the effect persisted 1 year after intervention. In addition, PSS (F = 55.22, P < .000) and SAS (F = 148.92, P < .000) scores were significantly decreased at T2 and T3. Conclusion The research preliminarily revealed that the MTCC programme was simple, effective, and more suitable to clinical nurses which should be recommended to cancer survivors to promote their recovery.

TI  - Heart of Joy: a Randomized Controlled Trail Evaluating the Effect of an Appreciative Joy Meditation Training on Subjective Well-Being and Attitudes
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies support the beneficial effects of the four immeasurable meditations (FIM) that originate from Buddhism, but most psychological interventions adopt FIM that cultivate loving-kindness and compassion. The current study developed and evaluated a 4-week training program named Heart of Joy (HOJ) that is based on FIM that cultivate appreciative joy. Participants were randomly assigned to HOJ training (n=59) or a wait-list condition (n=42), and the final sample consisted of 41 participants in each condition. Satisfaction with life, appreciative joy, envy, emotions, and attitudes toward oneself and others were measured at pre-training, at post-training, and at a 1-month follow-up. The time x condition (M)ANOVA showed that HOJ participants had significantly higher low-arousal positive emotions and lower high-arousal and low-arousal negative emotions at both the post-training and follow-up assessments, as well as higher medium-arousal positive emotions at the post-training assessment only. HOJ participants also reported significantly higher life satisfaction at both the post-training and follow-up assessments and significantly lower envy at the follow-up assessment. The results had a medium effect size (Cohen's d values ranging from 0.52 to 0.69). Appreciative joy, all attitudes, high-arousal positive emotions, and medium-arousal negative emotions did not show significant results. Further investigations revealed that changes in appreciative joy were more closely associated with changes in high-arousal than low-arousal positive emotions, and changes in envy were more closely associated with changes in attitudes toward oneself than attitudes toward others; this outcome indicates that appreciative joy and envy were impacted during this intervention. This study suggests that HOJ is a promising training program to improve subjective well-being and envy, and the implications for research were discussed.

TI  - Nursing Student's Experiences of Meditation on Twin Hearts During Eight Weeks Practice: A Qualitative Content Analysis
T2  - SAGE OPEN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Meditation on Twin Hearts (MTH) involves blessing the earth to alleviate the sufferings, and praying for the well-being of the entire society using heart and crown chakra. This meditation is characterized by mechanisms of loving-kindness, self-healing imagery, and open awareness.Purpose: This study aims to identify the experiences and perceived benefits associated with practicing MTH by nursing students.Method: Qualitative method using content analysis was used to study meditation experiences. After obtaining the informed consent, 22 nursing students were introduced to MTH. Experiences and feedback from meditation sessions were reported each day during their 8 week practice. Nursing students also answered seven open-ended questions on the last day of the meditation session.Findings: The verbatim descriptions of experiences reported by nursing students were abstracted to elements (17), properties (6), and categories (2). Identified properties are positive experiences, experiences of awareness, energy experiences, tangible outcomes, physiological reactions, and feedback on the study program.Conclusion: The experiences narrated by nursing students include positive affective experiences, health benefits, resolution of problem, awareness and energy experiences, and prosocial tendencies. These findings indicate that MTH would enhance the well-being of the nursing students and could be used as a self-care measure.

TI  - Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness has received considerable attention as a correlate of psychological well-being and potential mechanism for the success of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Despite a common emphasis of mindfulness, at least in name, among MBIs, mindfulness proves difficult to assess, warranting consideration of other common components. Self-compassion, an important construct that relates to many of the theoretical and practical components of MBIs, may be an important predictor of psychological health. The present study compared ability of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) to predict anxiety, depression, worry, and quality of life in a large community sample seeking self-help for anxious distress (N = 504). Multivariate and univariate analyses showed that self-compassion is a robust predictor of symptom severity and quality of life, accounting for as much as ten times more unique variance in the dependent variables than mindfulness. Of particular predictive utility are the self-judgment and isolation subscales of the SCS. These findings suggest that self-compassion is a robust and important predictor of psychological health that may be an important component of MBIs for anxiety and depression. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Christian Accommodative Mindfulness: Definition, Current Research, and Group Protocol
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - More clinicians are using mindfulness-based therapeutic strategies; however, Evangelical Christian clients sometimes worry about the Buddhist origins of these treatments. Christian accommodative mindfulness (CAM) attempts to address these concerns with culturally sensitive adaptations to mindfulness methods. We present a definition of CAM and propose some worldview adjustments to typical mindfulness constructs when working with these clients. The empirical research on Christian-derived meditation strategies and Christian-adapted mindfulness strategies will then be reviewed. We introduce a four-session group CAM protocol currently being researched that focuses on scripture meditation, breath meditation, body awareness, and loving-kindness meditation. Sample scripts are included.

T2  - HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This article presents a brief overview of the empirical evidence of well-established mindfulness interventions and an in-depth review of less-established compassion-based interventions (CBIs) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Definitions, cognitive and physiological mechanisms, and methods of assessment are discussed.Method A literature review using the databases Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and PubMed was conducted.Results Whereas the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has been documented in many trials, only seven randomized, controlled trials have been completed on CBIs and LKM. In these trials, CBIs were effective in treating psychotic disorders, affective disorders with psychotic features, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, and patients with suicide attempts in the past year; LKM was effective in treating chronic pain; and a combination of both was effective for borderline personality disorder. A larger number of nonrandomized studies indicate that CBIs and LKM may be effective in treating a wide range of clinical conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, chronic pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder.Conclusions Further studies are needed to confirm the promising effects of CBIs and LKM. Preliminary evidence suggests that both approaches might be beneficial across various clinical populations. Future studies need to clarify whether these approaches might be options as stand-alone treatments or as adjuncts or augmentation of evidence-based methods in psychotherapy.

TI  - Mindful parenting: a Meta-analytic review of intrapersonal and interpersonal parental outcomes
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) are increasingly used to reduce parental stress and to enhance dyadic interactions between parents and children. Prior reviews examining the effects of MPBs for parents have assessed restricted target populations, limited outcomes measures, and have relied on uncontrolled studies. This systematic and meta-analytic review quantified the efficacy of MBPs for parents using comprehensive intrapersonal and interpersonal outcome measures and methodologically robust studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of MBPs on parents were identified, data were extracted, and assessed for risk of bias by two independent reviewers. Twenty studies (n = 1003) were included in the analyses. Programs had moderate effects for general stress (Hedge's g = 0.410), internalizing psychological symptoms (Hedge's g = 0.519), and well-being (Hedge's g = 0.588). Small-to-moderate effects were observed for combined mindfulness (Hedge's g = 0.295), parenting stress (Hedge's g = 0.284), and parenting behavior (Hedge's g = 0.299). Effects were not significant for parental interactions with children, marital outcomes, self-compassion, emotion regulation, general mindfulness, and mindful parenting. Subgroup analyses revealed that populations with medical conditions (Hedge's g = 1.203) benefited more from MBPs compared to populations with psychological symptoms (Hedge's g = 0.452). Furthermore, parents showed greater improvement on well-being when both parents and children engaged in mindfulness training (Hedge's g = 0.838) compared to parents alone (Hedge's g = 0.700). Results support the efficacy of MBPs in improving intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes for parents. Diversity within the programs may contribute towards non-significant changes in general mindfulness and mindful parenting. Future studies should use standardized mindfulness-based parenting programs to enhance methodological rigor.

TI  - Examining interpersonal self-transcendence as a potential mechanism linking meditation and social outcomes
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Distinct types of meditation practice addressed in this review can help cultivate skills people may bring to later social interactions. We examine self-transcendence, or the drive to benefit others beyond the self, as a key mechanism through which meditation may promote positive social outcomes. Self-transcendence cultivated through various styles of meditation can impact social outcomes through two main pathways: First, self-transcendence can turn rigid, defensive self-focus into flexible and receptive self-construals. Second, it can increase positive other-focus by integrating reward and social signals in the brain. These accounts offer one practical solution of positively transforming social relations and highlight potential usefulness of considering self-transcendence in researching social effects of meditation.

TI  - Enhancing Chronic Non-Cancer Pain Management: A Systematic Review of Mindfulness Therapies and Guided Imagery Interventions
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives: There has been an increasing interest in the use of non-pharmacological approaches for the multidimensional treatment of chronic pain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies and Guided Imagery (GI) interventions in managing chronic non-cancer pain and related outcomes. Materials and Methods: Searching three electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus) and following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was performed on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and pilot RCTs investigating mindfulness or GI interventions in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was utilized to assess the quality of the evidence, with outcomes encompassing pain intensity, opioid consumption, and non-sensorial dimensions of pain. Results: Twenty-six trials met the inclusion criteria, with most of them exhibiting a moderate to high risk of bias. A wide diversity of chronic pain types were under analysis. Amongst the mindfulness interventions, and besides the classical programs, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) emerges as an approach that improves interoception. Six trials demonstrated that mindfulness techniques resulted in a significant reduction in pain intensity, and three trials also reported significant outcomes with GI. Evidence supports a significant improvement in non-sensory dimensions of pain in ten trials using mindfulness and in two trials involving GI. Significant effects on opioid consumption were reported in four mindfulness-based trials, whereas one study involving GI found a small effect with that variable. Conclusions: This study supports the evidence of benefits of both mindfulness techniques and GI interventions in the management of chronic non-cancer pain. Regarding the various mindfulness interventions, a specific emphasis on the positive results of MORE should be highlighted. Future studies should focus on specific pain types, explore different durations of the mindfulness and GI interventions, and evaluate emotion-related outcomes.

TI  - Acceptability and feasibility of the Heartfulness Way: A social-emotional learning program for school-going adolescents in India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The interest in life skills education programs in schools is growing. Yet, there is limited evidence on implementation indicators for such programs in low-income countries.Aim: We present a qualitative evaluation of the acceptability and feasibility of the Heartfulness Way program-a secondary school-based social-emotional program, based on mindfulness techniques delivered by teachers in India.Methods: This qualitative study collected data from 12 schools in four Indian cities, namely, Chennai, Hyderabad, Prayagraj, and Pune. Data collection included focus group discussions with adolescents (n = 24) and teachers (n = 12), semistructured interviews with school principals (n = 12), program delivering teachers (n = 7), and program staff (n = 4). A thematic analysis was performed using NVivo 12. Results: Overall, the mindfulness-based classroom curriculum was strongly supported by participants. Acceptability was determined by positive responses, prosocial behavior, self-acceptance, and supportive bonds, according to students. Several themes of perceived benefits of the program including, improved relationships among peers and between students and teachers were identified. In general, the teachers' interviews indicated that there was a high level of satisfaction with the training and curriculum provided by the program. Teachers were able to provide high coverage (75%-80%) of the program activities, but several potential barriers were also identified, including insufficient training for teachers and the need for direct supervision.Conclusion: The Heartfulness Way program, a social-emotional learning intervention, has shown strong support for acceptance and delivery by school communities. Future studies are needed to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this program for improving the health and well-being of school-aged adolescents.

TI  - Heart Rate Variability, Cortisol and Attention Focus During Shamatha Quiescence Meditation
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK
M3  - Article
AB  - Cardiac vagal tone can be seen as a stable marker for the ability to sustain attention and regulate emotion, two factors associated with the quality of meditation. In this study, heart rate variability (HRV) has been monitored in different forms of Shamatha quiescence meditation: three breath meditations, Settling the Mind in its natural state, Awareness of Awareness, Loving-kindness and Tonglen. Establish and test a practical means of monitoring neurobiological effects of meditation. Over 6 weeks, two experimental groups practiced Shamatha meditation on a daily basis (n = 20). HRV patterns and cortisol tests were monitored at three measuring points during these weeks, and an attention focus test was performed at the start and after 6 weeks. Six weeks of regular practice in Shamatha meditation were associated with HRV indices suggesting improvements in the homeostatic regulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in 85% of the HRV recordings (tachogram and frequency specter) of all 20 subjects. Further, a substantial decrease in cortisol levels was also noted. The attention focus test showed a significant increase of 18.7% in sustained attention, moving from medium to high attention focus, with a significant result of t(20) = - 8.764 and p < 0.001. Participants reported positive subjective changes in attention focus, sense of happiness and calmness and increased abilities in emotional regulation and attunement. Six weeks of regular practice in Shamatha meditation contributes to a substantial increase of attention focus and a decrease in stress levels evidenced in changes in diurnal cortisol measures. HRV biofeedback shows that the sympathetic nervous system is counterbalanced by increased vagal tone, and autonomic balance is enhanced by all Shamatha meditations, not only breath meditations, but also mind meditations: Settling the Mind in its natural state, Awareness of Awareness, Loving-kindness and Tonglen. Although these results are promising, further research is recommended with HRV biofeedback instruments to report statistical analysis and to understand unique HRV patterns in Shamatha mind meditation.

TI  - Positive Psychological Well-Being and Cardiovascular Disease <i>JACC</i> Health Promotion Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Facets of positive psychological well-being, such as optimism, have been identified as positive health assets because they are prospectively associated with the 7 metrics of cardiovascular health (CVH) and improved outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. Connections between psychological well-being and cardiovascular conditions may be mediated through biological, behavioral, and psychosocial pathways. Individual-level interventions, such as mindfulness-based programs and positive psychological interventions, have shown promise for modifying psychological well-being. Further, workplaces are using well-being-focused interventions to promote employee CVH, and these interventions represent a potential model for expanding psychological well-being programs to communities and societies. Given the relevance of psychological well-being to promoting CVH, this review outlines clinical recommendations to assess and promote wellbeing in encounters with patients. Finally, a research agenda is proposed. Additional prospective observational studies are needed to understand mechanisms underlying the connection between psychological well-being and cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, rigorous intervention trials are needed to assess whether psychological well-being-promoting programs can improve cardiovascular outcomes.

TI  - Conceptualizing the key processes of Mindful Parenting and its application to youth mental health
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Youth mental health disorders are rising across the world. Mindful Parenting could be a potential tool to promote youth mental health. The primary distinction between Mindful Parenting programs and other behavioral parenting programs is the focus on emotional literacy and compassion. However, this emerging field has gaps in its theory and evidence. In order to objectively evaluate the impact of Mindful Parenting, it is important to identify how it promotes change. This theoretical paper aims to articulate the key change processes of Mindful Parenting that promote positive outcomes.Method: A literature review was conducted to synthesize the change processes outlined by different authors in the field.Results: Key processes argued to promote Mindful Parenting were aligned with five main categories, namely attention, intention, attitude, attachment and emotion. More specifically the change processes were listening, emotional awareness, emotional regulation, attentional regulation, attunement, attention to variability, intentionality, reperceiving, compassion and non-judgmental acceptance.Conclusions: This preliminary analysis attempted to understand how Mindful Parenting fosters change and transformation. Whilst there are numerous change processes, the essence of Mindful Parenting appears to be the ability to be responsive to a child's needs.

TI  - Effects of brief mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation inductions on emotional and behavioral responses to social rejection among individuals with high borderline personality traits
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an enduring pattern of instability across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal domains. Individuals with BPD are known to be particularly vulnerable to experiences of social rejection, but little work has examined strategies that may moderate their reactivity to social rejection. Using a laboratory experimental approach, this study investigated the effects of brief mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) inductions on emotional and behavioral responses to social rejection in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. One hundred and eighteen participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 min of mindful breathing practice, LKM, or a no-instruction control condition, prior to exposure to a social rejection manipulation. Participants rated their emotions and completed a competitive reaction time task, which provided a proxy measure of aggression. Compared to the control condition, the mindfulness group demonstrated significantly quicker recovery in negative affect and feelings of rejection after social rejection. The mindfulness group also reported significantly quicker recovery in negative affect compared to the LKM group. Whereas baseline trait mindfulness negatively predicted aggressive behaviors across all participants, groups did not differ in immediate emotional reactivity or aggressive behavior following social rejection. The findings suggest that mindfulness training may be a promising strategy in alleviating negative emotional effects of social rejection among individuals with high borderline personality traits, and highlight the limited utility of brief LKM practice in buffering the effects of social rejection.

TI  - FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF MINDFULNESS FOR SURVIVORS OF HOMICIDE AND THEIR PROVIDERS
T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study uses participatory research methods with survivors of homicide and their service providers to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted mindfulness intervention for stress reduction and resilience in homicide survivors.Procedures: Our mixed methods approach included: (a) previewing a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program with providers and survivors; (b) using their iterative feedback during focus groups to revise the curriculum; and (c) studying the acceptability of the adapted curriculum for survivors through focus group and standardized data collection.Findings: We learned that providers use mindfulness for self care and both providers and survivors view the approach for survivors as promising. Based on attendance, participation, and focus group data, the adapted curriculum was both feasible and acceptable. Survivors' reports suggested most experienced improved emotion regulation, feelings of empowerment, and better coping.Conclusions: Culturally adapted mindfulness programs may support healing for homicide survivors and possibly other low-income people of color with significant trauma backgrounds. Further investigation is needed to rigorously assess outcomes and specific. effects, both positive and negative, of mindfulness in this and other more diversified populations.

T2  - Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association
M3  - Evaluation Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: This article describes a factor analysis of a 22-item version of the Serenity Scale, a tool that measures spirituality and well-being.METHOD: A sample of 87 participants, enrolled in a National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial examining the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management post-solid organ transplantation, completed the abbreviated instrument.FINDINGS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded three subscales: acceptance, inner haven, and trust. The Serenity Scale was positively associated with positive affect and mindful awareness and inversely related to negative affect, anxiety, depression, health distress and transplant-related stress.CONCLUSIONS: Serenity, a dimension of spirituality that is secular and distinct from religious orientation or religiosity, shows promise as a tool that could be used to measure outcomes of nursing interventions that improve health and well-being.IMPLICATIONS: Spirituality is recognized as being an essential component of holistic nursing practice. As nurses expand their use of spiritual interventions, it is important to document outcomes related to nursing care. The Serenity Scale appears to capture a dimension of spirituality, a state of acceptance, inner haven and trust that is distinct from other spirituality instruments.

TI  - Does your mindfulness benefit others? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the link between mindfulness and prosocial behaviour
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mindfulness-based meditation practices have received substantial scientific attention in recent years. Mindfulness has been shown to bring many psychological benefits to the individual, but much less is known about whether these benefits extend to others. This meta-analysis reviewed the link between mindfulness - as both a personality variable and an intervention - and prosocial behaviour. A literature search produced 31 eligible studies (N = 17,241) and 73 effect sizes. Meta-analyses were conducted using mixed-effects structural equation models to examine pooled effects and potential moderators of these effects. We found a positive pooled effect between mindfulness and prosocial behaviour for both correlational (d = .73 CI 95% [0.51 to 0.96]) and intervention studies (d = .51 CI 95% [0.37 to 0.66]). For the latter, medium-sized effects were obtained across varying meditation types and intensities, and across gender and age categories. Preliminary evidence is presented regarding potential mediators of these effects. Although we found that mindfulness is positively related to prosociality, further research is needed to examine the mediators of this link and the contexts in which it is most pronounced.

TI  - Examination of trait impulsivity on the response to a brief mindfulness intervention among college student drinkers
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based strategies show promise for targeting the construct of impulsivity and associated variables among problematic alcohol users. This study examined the moderating role of intervention (mindfulness vs relaxation vs control) on trait impulsivity and three outcomes examined post-intervention (negative affect, positive affect, and urge to drink) among 207 college students with levels of at risk drinking. Moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between baseline impulsivity and the primary outcomes significantly differed for participants who underwent the mindfulness versus relaxation interventions. Notably, simple slope analyses revealed that negative urgency was positively associated with urge to drink following the mindfulness intervention. Among participants who underwent the relaxation intervention, analysis of simple slopes revealed that negative urgency was negatively associated with urge to drink, while positive urgency was positively associated with positive affect following the relaxation intervention. Findings suggest that level (low vs high) and subscale of impulsivity matter with regard to how a participant will respond to a mindfulness versus relaxation intervention.

TI  - The effect of four Immeasurables meditations on depressive symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - The Four Immeasurables Meditations (FIM) intervention have been shown as a promising intervention for reducing depressive symptoms. The current study is a systematic review of FIM intervention effects on depressive symptoms. Among 192 empirical research articles on FIM published before May 2019, 40 independent trials from 35 records measured depressive symptoms. The meta-analysis included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCT; n = 1468) and 16 uncontrolled trials (n = 376). The results supported overall effectiveness of FIM on depressive symptoms (d = 0.38 for RCT and d = 0.87 for uncontrolled trials). Moderator analysis indicated the effects differed across protocols, and effects were smaller in RCT using active control groups. No significant differences were observed for participant type, measures, intervention length, or intervention components. Individual studies found no direct association between meditation practice time and effects, and mindfulness and self-compassion were widely supported as mechanisms of change. Current evidence supports FIM as an effective intervention for reducing depressive symptoms, but additional studies with more rigorous designs using active control groups are needed. Further investigation should be encouraged regarding specific protocols and participants, the contribution of meditation practice, and other mechanisms such as positive emotions.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction teachers, practice characteristics, cancer incidence, and health: a nationwide ecological description
T2  - BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies have demonstrated the potential of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program to improve the condition of individuals with health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic pain; improve psychological well-being; reduce stress levels; and increase survival among cancer patients. To date, only one study has focused on the effect of long-term meditation on stress, showing a positive protective relationship. However, the relationship between meditation and cancer incidence remains unexplored. The objective of this study was to describe the state-level relationship between MBSR instructors and their practices and county-level health outcomes, including cancer incidence, in the United States.Methods: This ecologic study was performed using geospatial mapping and descriptive epidemiology of statewide MBSR characteristics and overall health, mental health state rankings, and age-adjusted cancer incidence rates.Results: Weak to moderate state-level correlations between meditation characteristics and colorectal and cervical cancer incidence were detected, with states with more meditation (e.g., more MBSR teachers per population) correlated with a decreased cancer incidence. A negative correlation was detected between lung & bronchus cancer and years teaching MBSR only. Moderate positive correlations were detected between Hodgkin's Lymphoma and female breast cancer in relation to all meditation characteristics. Statistically significant correlations with moderate coefficients were detected for overall health ranks and all meditation characteristics, most strongly for total number of years teaching MBSR and total number of years of general meditation practice.Conclusions: Our analyses might suggest that a relationship exists between the total number of MBSR teachers per state and the total number of years of general meditation practice per state, and colorectal and cervical cancer incidence. Positive correlations were observed with overall health rankings. Despite this study's limitations, its findings could serve to generate hypotheses and to inform and motivate a new focus on meditation and stress reduction in relation to cancer incidence, with specific relevance to colorectal and cervical cancer.

TI  - Feasibility Pilot of a Brief Mindfulness Intervention for College Students with Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Problem Drinking
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant subset of college students experience PTSD symptoms, and many engage in problematic alcohol use. Some college students with PTSD symptoms may use alcohol and other substances to cope with their symptoms, and those with PTSD experience more negative alcohol and drug consequences than those without PTSD. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been successfully utilized for individuals with PTSD or substance use disorders. However, to date, no studies have evaluated MBIs for college students with co-occurring PTSD symptoms and problem drinking. This study was a feasibility pilot of a 4-week group loving-kindness meditation (LKM) intervention, a practice of intentionally directing well wishes to oneself and others. LKM was compared to referral to treatment as usual (RTAU) for non-treatment seeking college students (N=75) with PTSD symptoms and problem drinking. Overall, the LKM group had low to moderate feasibility and acceptability among college students, as recruitment was lower than expected and attendance at LKM groups was modest. Participants' PTSD symptoms, drinking quantity, and negative drinking consequences decreased, and state mindfulness increased over the course of the study, but there were no significant differences between LKM and RTAU on these outcomes. Additionally, higher coping drinking motives predicted greater PTSD symptoms and more drinking consequences over the course of the study. Effective interventions for college students with PTSD symptoms and problematic alcohol use are needed, especially for individuals who drink to cope with their PTSD symptoms. Future research on LKM that addresses the limitations of the current study is warranted.

TI  - Breath, Love, Walk? The Impact of Mindfulness Interventions on Climate Policy Support and Environmental Attitudes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness practices have the potential to induce the cognitive and behavioral changes needed to foster pro-environmental behavior and increase support toward sustainable and climate-oriented policies. However, the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of meditation on sustainable behavior is limited and mostly confined to correlational studies, often based on the same type of mindfulness interventions. In this paper, we report the results of an online experiment (n = 1000) comparing the impact of three different short-term mindfulness interventions on various (self-reported and incentivized) measures of mindfulness state and sustainable behavior. While only one of our interventions is found to impact environmental attitude and climate policy support directly, we show that the three meditation practices indirectly foster sustainable behavior through preidentified mediators. These results are relevant for organizations and policymakers who seek to foster climate policy support and environmental attitudes in their stakeholders.

TI  - Unique relationships between facets of mindfulness and eating pathology among female smokers
T2  - EATING BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Female smokers often have higher levels of eating disorder symptoms than non-smokers, and concerns about eating and weight might interfere with smoking cessation. Thus, it is critical to identify factors to promote healthier eating and body image in this population. Initial research suggests that specific aspects of trait mindfulness predict lower body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms among non-smokers. However, these relationships are unknown among smokers. The current study examined associations between facets of trait mindfulness and eating disorder symptoms in 112 college female smokers (83% Caucasian: mean age 20 years, SD = 1.69). After controlling for relevant sociodemographic variables, Describing and Nonjudging facets of mindfulness predicted lower bulimic symptoms and body dissatisfaction (ps < .05), while Acting with Awareness predicted lower bulimic and anorexic symptoms, ps < .05. Observing predicted higher anorexic symptoms, ps < .05. These results suggest that specific mindfulness facets are related to lower eating disorder symptoms among smokers, whereas other facets are not associated or have a positive relationship with these symptoms. Mindfulness-based interventions focusing on Describing, Nonjudging, and Acting with Awareness may help to reduce eating pathology among female smokers, which could potentially improve smoking cessation rates in this population.

TI  - The Role of Emotion and Emotion Regulation in Social Anxiety Disorder
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many psychiatric disorders involve problematic patterns of emotional reactivity and regulation. In this review, we consider recent findings regarding emotion and emotion regulation in the context of social anxiety disorder (SAD). We first describe key features of SAD which suggest altered emotional and self-related processing difficulties. Next, we lay the conceptual foundation for a discussion of emotion and emotion regulation and present a common framework for understanding emotion regulation, the process model of emotion regulation. Using the process model, we evaluate the recent empirical literature spanning self-report, observational, behavioral, and physiological methods across five specific families of emotion regulation processes-situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. Next, we examine the empirical evidence behind two psychosocial interventions for SAD: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Throughout, we present suggestions for future directions in the continued examination of emotion and emotion regulation in SAD.

TI  - Is There a Dark Side to Mindfulness? Relation of Mindfulness to Criminogenic Cognitions
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions have been modified for use with inmate populations, but how this might relate to specific criminogenic cognitions has not been examined empirically. Theoretically, characteristics of mindfulness should be incompatible with distorted patterns of criminal thinking, but is this in fact the case? Among both 259 male jail inmates and 516 undergraduates, mindfulness was inversely related to the Criminogenic Cognitions Scale (CCS) through a latent variable of emotion regulation. However, in the jail sample, this mediational model also showed a direct, positive path from mindfulness to CCS, with an analogous, but nonsignificant trend in the college sample. Post hoc analyses indicate that the Nonjudgment of Self scale derived from the Mindfulness Inventory: Nine Dimensions (MI:ND) largely accounts for this apparently iatrogenic effect in both samples. Some degree of self-judgment is perhaps necessary and useful, especially among individuals involved in the criminal justice system.

TI  - Ethics, Self-Care and Well-Being for Psychologists: Reenvisioning the Stress-Distress Continuum
T2  - PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well-accepted that occupational hazards are endemic to the profession of psychology and that psychologists bring both strengths and vulnerabilities to their choice of career. Given the pressures faced by psychologists in contemporary society, how can we most effectively meet our ethical obligation to maintain competence throughout our professional life span in order to provide high quality care to those we serve? In this article, we propose to expand the current conceptualization of psychologist functioning as embodied in the widely promulgated stress-distress continuum. Through the incorporation of a positive dimension, we can envision the potential for psychologists to spiral up via their practice of enhanced self-care. Four foundational principles are interwoven throughout our consideration of effective self-care for psychologists: an emphasis on flourishing (rather than merely surviving), intentionality, an awareness of reciprocity in care of self and others and the benefits of integrating self-care into our daily practices and routines, rather than being added onto existing personal and professional obligations. A review of the literature on psychologist self-care strategies, healthy lifestyles, mindfulness, acceptance-based therapies, and positive psychology informs our endorsement of mindfulness-based positive principles and practice (MPPP's) for psychologists. These MPPP's are broadly conceptualized as the how of effective self-care that supports the what (as in what to do) in this realm. Finally, we envision a future in which effective self-care embedded in MPPP's is truly valued, supported and promoted by the profession in a manner that complements and sustains our ongoing well-being and professional competence.

TI  - Extremely brief mindfulness interventions for women undergoing breast biopsies: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeMindfulness-based programs can reduce stress and help practitioners to have positive attitudes in their daily lives. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of brief Mindfulness interventions on quantitative and qualitative stress parameters in patients undergoing imaging-guided breast biopsies.MethodsEighty-two women undergoing percutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy were randomized into two groups: MBI group or standard care group. One week before the biopsy procedure, on the waiting room and during the biopsy procedure, the MBI group was exposed to mindfulness techniques and the standard care group received supportive dialogue from the biopsy team. Participants completed questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety and stress, demographics, and medical history, besides evaluating their pain experience through a visual analogue scale for pain and had their systolic and diastolic blood pressure, initial and final temperate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and salivary cortisol measured.ResultsParticipation in the mindfulness intervention group was associated with reduced levels of perceived stress, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation compared to participation in the standard care group (P values<0.05). No difference was observed regarding salivary cortisol levels, peripheral temperature, and pain perception between the two studied groups.ConclusionResults indicate that an extremely brief mindfulness intervention is a feasible intervention, suggesting that Mindfulness-based programs may be beneficial to reduce discomfort in acutely stressful settings.

TI  - The Head and the Heart: Effects of Understanding and Experiencing Lovingkindness on Attitudes Toward the Self and Others
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Formation and maintenance of compassionate and loving attitudes toward the self and others is essential for adaptive social functioning. In this study, we use lovingkindness meditation to enhance positive attitudes toward the self and others. Meditation-based programs often include several components for which specific effects and dynamics are largely unknown, precluding conclusive support for their effectiveness. The present study tested actions underlying two main components of lovingkindness meditation programs: discussion and meditation. Discussion focuses on a conceptual understanding of lovingkindness, whereas meditation focuses on direct experiences and cultivation of lovingkindness. Participants (n = 54) were randomly assigned either to attend a 6-week lovingkindness discussion course or to be waitlisted for 6 weeks, both followed by attending a 6-week lovingkindness meditation course. Attending the lovingkindness discussion course alone had beneficial effects on attitudes toward the self, but not others. Attending the lovingkindness meditation course had additional positive impacts on attitudes toward the self and others. These findings suggest that understanding ideas of lovingkindness through knowledge-based discussion without meditation may be sufficient to create positive changes in the view of self. However, for more comprehensive changes in attitude toward others, direct experiences of lovingkindness through meditation may be necessary.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness in patients with schizophrenia
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is frequently used to attenuate the severity of positive schizophrenia symptoms; however, few studies have focused on attenuating negative symptoms. Recently, researchers have become interested in the effects of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on schizophrenia, but the lack of evidence-based results from random clinical trials (RCTs) has limited their effectiveness. Moreover, longitudinal data must be examined using appropriate study designs. We recruited 60 schizophrenia patients and randomly assigned them to an MBI or to a treatment-as-usual group. Negative symptoms, positive symptoms, mindfulness, and depression were assessed at baseline, post-course, and at a 3-month follow-up. Descriptive analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEES) were used to examine the effects of MBI. We found that MBI mitigated the severity of negative symptoms and of general schizophrenic psychopathology except for the positive symptoms and for those of depression. Unexpectedly, we did not find long-term effect of mindfulness on negative symptoms. Larger sample sizes, long-term practical course, more rigorous study procedures, and a double-blind design should be considered in future studies.

TI  - Brief mindfulness session improves mood and increases salivary oxytocin in psychology students
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to be effective in increasing empathy in health professionals. Yet, more research is needed to analyse the specific influence of mindfulness exercises on biological variables involved in empathy, such as the biological system of oxytocin activity. In this study, we analyse the effects of a brief mindfulness session on positive and negative affect, state anxiety and salivary oxytocin (sOXT) in psychology students (N = 68). In the experimental group (n = 42), a mindfulness session was performed that included different guided meditation exercises. In the control group (n = 26), an emotion recognition exercise was carried out, along with a series of creative activities. Results showed that the mindfulness session was effective, because there was a significant reduction in negative affect (d = -.56, p < .001) and state anxiety (d = -.54, p = .007) in the experimental group. Likewise, there was an increase in sOXT (d = .99, p < .001) in this group, compared with the control group. Guided mindfulness meditation practice could be useful to reach an emotional and biological state that facilitates empathy. In this regard, the increase in sOXT after the mindfulness session adds further evidence about the biological mechanisms underlying the benefits of MBI on empathy.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive group therapy for women with breast and gynecologic cancer: a pilot study to determine effectiveness and feasibility
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Group-based mindfulness training is frequently described in psycho-oncology literature, but little is known of the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). We investigated the effectiveness and acceptability of MBCT for women with breast and gynecologic cancer.Fifty women were recruited to participate in eight weekly 2-h mindfulness sessions. Outcomes of distress, quality of life (QOL), post-traumatic growth, and mindfulness were assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and again 3 months later using validated measures. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVAs with a Bonferroni correction. Participant satisfaction and evaluation were also assessed.Forty-two women completed the program, and complete data were available for 36 women. Significant improvements with large effect sizes (eta rho(2)) were observed for distress (P < 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.238), QOL (P = 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.204), mindfulness (P < 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.363) and post-traumatic growth (P < 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.243). Gains were maintained 3 months post-intervention. Improvements in outcomes did not differ based on diagnostic group, psychological status, or physical well-being at entry. Change indices further support these findings. Scores on measures of distress, QOL, and post-traumatic growth decreased as a function of increased mindfulness at each time point (all P < 0.05). Participants reported experiencing the program as beneficial, particularly its group-based nature, and provided positive feedback of the therapy as a whole as well as its individual components.Within the limits of a non-randomized trial, these findings provide preliminary support for the potential psychosocial benefits of MBCT in a heterogeneous group of women with cancer. Future, more comprehensive trials are needed to provide systematic evidence of this therapy in oncology settings.

T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Group face-to-face and individual internet-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT and eMBCT) have been demonstrated to reduce psychological distress for distressed cancer patients in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). This study focused on the long-term effects of this RCT during the nine-month follow-up period, and on possible predictors, moderators and working mechanisms.Methods: Distressed cancer patients (n=245) were randomized to MBCT or eMBCT. Data were collected at baseline, post-treatment, three- and nine-month follow-up. Data were analyzed with linear mixed effect models and (hierarchical) linear regressions.Results: Analyses revealed long-term reductions in psychological distress and rumination, and long-term increases in positive mental health and mental health-related quality of life (QoL) in both interventions over the course of the nine-month follow-up. Interestingly, patients reported less psychological distress in the follow-up period after eMBCT in comparison to MBCT. Less psychological distress, rumination and neuroticism, and more extraversion and agreeableness at baseline predicted less psychological distress at the nine-month follow-up after both interventions. Less mindful and conscientious patients at baseline benefited more from eMBCT than from MBCT. Regarding working mechanisms, changes in mindfulness skills, fear of cancer recurrence and rumination during both interventions predicted less psychological distress at follow-up.Conclusions: Our findings suggest most improvements in cancer patients' increase over time after both interventions. Furthermore, patients seemed to benefit more from eMBCT than MBCT based on psychological distress levels, especially those patients with low levels of mindfulness skills and conscientiousness.

TI  - Development of a mindfulness-based intervention for narcolepsy: a feasibility study
T2  - SLEEP
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objectives Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to improve psychosocial functioning in medical populations but have not been studied in narcolepsy. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an MBI that was adapted for narcolepsy, including three variations in program length.Methods Adults with narcolepsy (N = 60) were randomized to MBI groups of varying durations: brief (4 weeks), standard (8 weeks), or extended (12 weeks). Participants completed assessments at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. To assess feasibility and acceptability, primary outcomes included attendance, meditation practice, and data completeness. Additionally, participants completed measures of mindfulness, self-compassion, mood, sleep, psychosocial functioning, and cognition. An effect size of Cohen's d >= 0.5 was used as the prespecified benchmark for a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).Results The attendance, meditation, and data completeness benchmarks were met by 71.7%, 61.7%, and 78.3% of participants, respectively. Higher proportions of the brief and extended groups met these benchmarks compared to the standard group. All groups met the MCID for mindfulness, self-compassion, self-efficacy for managing emotions, positive psychosocial impact, global mental health, and fatigue. Standard and extended groups met the MCID for anxiety and depression, and extended groups met the MCID for additional measures including social and cognitive functioning, daytime sleepiness, hypersomnia symptoms, and hypersomnia-related functioning.Conclusions Results suggest that the remote delivery and data collection methods are feasible to employ in future clinical trials, and it appears that the extended MBI provides the most favorable clinical impact while maintaining attendance and engagement in meditation practice.Clinical Trial Registration Awareness and Self-Compassion Enhancing Narcolepsy Treatment (ASCENT), NCT04306952, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04306952Graphical Abstract

TI  - Enhanced Psychosocial Well-Being Following Participation in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program Is Associated with Increased Natural Killer Cell Activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programs have consistently been shown to enhance the psychosocial well-being of participants. Given the well-established association between psychosocial factors and immunologic functioning, it has been hypothesized that enhanced psychosocial well-being among MBSR participants would be associated with corresponding changes in markers of immune activity.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to examine changes in psychosocial and immunologic measures in a heterogeneous patient sample following participation in a MBSR program.Design: A single-group, pretest/post-test design was utilized.Setting: The intervention was conducted at an academic health center.Subjects: This pilot study involved 24 participants (aged 28-72 years). Inclusion criteria were as follows: >= 18 years of age, English-speaking, and no known autoimmune disorder.Intervention: The intervention was an 8-week MBSR program.Outcome measures: Distress and quality of life (QOL) measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form Health Survey, respectively. Immunologic measures included natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity and C-reactive protein (CRP).Results: Patients completed psychosocial assessments and provided a blood sample at baseline (pre-MBSR) and within 2 weeks post-MBSR. Significant improvements in anxiety and overall distress as well as across multiple domains of QOL were observed from baseline to post-MBSR. Reductions in anxiety and overall distress were associated with reductions in CRP. Patients who reported improvement in overall mental well-being also showed increased NK cytolytic activity from pre- to post-MBSR, whereas patients who reported no improvement in mental well-being showed no change in NK cytolytic activity.Conclusions: Positive improvement in psychologic well-being following MBSR was associated with increased NK cytolytic activity and decreased levels of CRP.

TI  - Effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention in the Management of Musculoskeletal Pain in Nursing Workers
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chronic pain is a prevalent disorder in nursing workers worldwide. Several studies have proposed measures to mitigate this critical scenario. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been found to have promising results in the treatment of this disorder.Aims: To quantify the effectiveness of an adapted mindfulness program (AMP) in the management of musculoskeletal pain (MSP) in nursing technicians of a Brazilian university hospital.Design: This study was a clinical, prospective, open, repeated measures trial, with data collection between January and July 2015.Settings: Brazilian university hospital.Participants/Subjects: Sixty-four female nursing technicians with a mean age of 47.01 years (standard deviation = 9.50) with chronic pain symptoms.Methods: Sixty-four female nursing technicians with a mean age of 47.01 years (standard deviation = 9.50) and MSP participated in this prospective study. Before the intervention (T0), scores of anxiety, depression, mindfulness, musculoskeletal complaints, pain catastrophizing, self-compassion, and perception of quality of life were quantified. These scores were reevaluated after 8 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks (T2) of weekly AMP sessions (60 minutes each). The variables were evaluated by analysis of variance for repeated measures, followed by the Bonferroni test.Results: AMP reduced the scores of musculoskeletal symptoms, anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing (p < .001). A significant increase was identified in self-compassion scores and perception of quality of life in the physical, psychological, and overall assessment (p <= .04). Positive effects of AMP occurred at T1 and remained unchanged at T2.Conclusion: AMP contributed to a reduction in painful symptoms and improved the quality of life of nursing workers, with a lasting effect until the 20th week of follow-up, indicating utility as an effective strategy for the management of MSP in the group studied.

TI  - Experiences of a Web-Based Nursing Intervention - Interviews with Women with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with fibromyalgia must simultaneously cope with chronic pain, emotional distress, activity avoidance and disability. The majority of fibromyalgia patients are women. New interventions using information and communications technologies such as Internet applications and smart phones can be used for text-based communications between providers and patients with chronic pain. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore female patients' experiences of participating in a 4-week web-based home intervention after in-house multidimensional rehabilitation. The framework of the intervention was inspired by mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy using daily diaries and situational feedback as tools. Interviews were made with seven women about their general experiences of participation, specific relationship with the therapist, coimnunication, activity, emotions, and coping. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using systematic text condensation. A main result was that informants experienced this follow-up program as consciousness expanding as well as both motivating and supportive. Another main result was their reported ambivalence in relation to: 1) using web-based technology; 2) experiencing feedback as challenging but positive; and 3) experiencing relationships of trust and detachment with the therapist. Web-based nursing stimulates a "zone for reflection" that may assist in the counseling and support of patients with chronic pain. However, this is a new area of research that needs to be further explored. (C) 2012 by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing

TI  - Effects on Mood and EEG States After Meditation in Augmented Reality With and Without Adjunctive Neurofeedback
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VIRTUAL REALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research and design of virtual reality technologies with mental-health focused applications has increased dramatically in recent years. However, the applications and psychological outcomes of augmented reality (AR) technologies still remain to be widely explored and evaluated. This is particularly true for the use of AR for the self-management of stress, anxiety, and mood. In the current study, we examined the impact of a brief open heart meditation AR experience on participants with moderate levels of anxiety and/or depression. Using a randomized between-group design subjects participated in the AR experience or the AR experience plus frontal gamma asymmetry neurofeedback integrated into the experience. Self-reported mood state and resting-state EEG were recorded before and after the AR intervention for both groups. Participants also reported on engagement and perceived use of the experience as a stress and coping tool. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of the frontal, midline, and parietal scalp regions, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of anterior cingulate and insular cortical regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both versions of the AR meditation significantly reduced negative mood and increased positive mood. The changes in resting state EEG were also comparable between groups, with some trending differences observed, in line with existing research on open heart and other loving-kindness and compassion-based meditations. Engagement was favorable for both versions of the AR experience, with higher levels of engagement reported with the addition of neurofeedback. These results provide early support for the therapeutic potential of AR-integrated meditations as a tool for the self-regulation of mood and emotion, and sets the stage for more research and development into health and wellness-promoting AR applications.

TI  - Individual Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Treating Depressive Symptoms in Patients With Diabetes: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - DIABETES CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVEDepression is a common comorbidity of diabetes, undesirably affecting patients' physical and mental functioning. Psychological interventions are effective treatments for depression in the general population as well as in patients with a chronic disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of individual mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in comparison with awaiting-list control condition for treating depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn this randomized controlled trial, 94 outpatients with diabetes and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II [ BDI-II] >= 14) were randomized to MBCT (n = 31), CBT (n = 32), or waiting list (n = 31). All participants completed written questionnaires and interviews at pre- and postmeasurement (3 months later). Primary outcome measure was severity of depressive symptoms (BDI-II and Toronto Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), well-being (Well-Being Index), diabetes-related distress (Problem Areas In Diabetes), and HbA(1c) levels were assessed as secondary outcomes.RESULTSResults showed that participants receiving MBCT and CBT reported significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared with patients in the waiting-list control condition (respectively, P = 0.004 and P < 0.001; d = 0.80 and 1.00; clinically relevant improvement 26% and 29% vs. 4%). Both interventions also had significant positive effects on anxiety, well-being, and diabetes-related distress. No significant effect was found on HbA(1c) values.CONCLUSIONSBoth individual MBCT and CBT are effective in improving a range of psychological symptoms in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness based stress reduction may be equally effective in reducing anxiety and depression in adults with autism spectrum disorders
T2  - RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anxiety and depression co-occur in 50-70% of adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but treatment methods for these comorbid problems have not been systematically studied. Recently, two ASD-tailored protocols were published: mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We wanted to investigate if both methods are equally effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms among adults with ASD. 59 adults with ASD and anxiety or depression scores above 7 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, gave informed consent to participate; 27 followed the CBT protocol, and 32 the MBSR treatment protocol. Anxiety and depression scores, autism symptoms, rumination, and global mood were registered at the start, at the end of the 13-week treatment period, and at 3-months follow-up. Irrational beliefs and mindful attention awareness were used as process measures during treatment and at follow-up. Results indicate that both MBSR and CBT are associated with a reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults with ASD, with a sustained effect at follow-up, but without a main effect for treatment group. A similar pattern was seen for the reduction of autistic symptoms, rumination and the improvement in global mood. There are some indications that MBSR may be preferred over CBT with respect to the treatment effect on anxiety when the scores on measures of irrational beliefs or positive global mood at baseline are high. Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapies are both promising treatment methods for reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in adults with ASD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is increasingly being used to improve outcomes such as stress and depression in a range of long-term conditions (LTCs). While systematic reviews on MBSR have taken place for a number of conditions there remains limited information on its impact on individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).Methods: Medline, Central, Embase, Amed, CINAHAL were searched in March 2016. These databases were searched using a combination of MeSH subject headings where available and keywords in the title and abstracts. We also searched the reference lists of related reviews. Study quality was assessed based on questions from the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.Results: Two interventions and three papers with a total of 66 participants were included. The interventions were undertaken in Belgium (n = 27) and the USA (n = 39). One study reported significantly increased grey matter density (GMD) in the brains of the MBSR group compared to the usual care group. Significant improvements were reported in one study for a number of outcomes including PD outcomes, depression, mindfulness, and quality of life indicators. Only one intervention was of reasonable quality and both interventions failed to control for potential confounders in the analysis. Adverse events and reasons for drop-outs were not reported. There was also no reporting on the costs/benefits of the intervention or how they affected health service utilisation.Conclusion: This systematic review found limited and inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of MBSR for PD patients. Both of the included interventions claimed positive effects for PD patients but significant outcomes were often contradicted by other results. Further trials with larger sample sizes, control groups and longer follow-ups are needed before the evidence for MBSR in PD can be conclusively judged.

TI  - Perceived Social Problem Solving, Perfectionism, and Mindful Awareness in Clinical Depression: An Exploratory Study
T2  - COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Perfectionism, problem solving, and mindfulness have all been variously implicated in the experience and treatment outcomes for depression. Maladaptive perfectionism represents a cognitive set that is believed to exacerbate the symptoms of depression, whereas social problem solving is believed to play a role in potentially buffering the effects of perfectionism on depressive symptomatology. Little is currently known about the role of mindfulness during a current depressive episode, however a number of studies have shown that mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduce relapse rates in depression. The current study examined the role of social problem solving, adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism, and mindful awareness during a current depressive episode. Participants were 141 inpatients experiencing a clinical depressive episode. No support was found for social problem solving buffering the effects of maladaptive perfectionism on depression severity. Results suggest that mindful awareness mediates the negative association between social problem solving and depression severity and the positive association between maladaptive perfectionism and depression severity. Mindful awareness contributed the greatest amount of variance to depression symptom severity.

TI  - The Healthy Quality of Mindful Breathing: Associations With Rumination and Depression
T2  - COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examines the relationships between mindfulness and rumination, repetitive negative thinking, and depressive symptoms, employing a newly developed paradigm for the assessment of mindfulness. Derived from a central exercise of mindfulness-based interventions, 42 undergraduates were asked to observe their breath for about 18 min. Within this time period, they were prompted 22 times at irregular intervals to indicate whether they had lost mindful contact with their breath as a result of mind wandering. The results show negative correlations between the degree of the ability to stay mindfully in contact with the breath and measures of rumination, repetitive negative thinking, and depression. Moreover, positive associations with self-report data of mindfulness and a negative relationship to fear of bodily sensations support the construct validity of our new approach for the assessment of mindfulness. In summary, findings suggest the healthy quality of mindful breathing regarding depression-related processes.

TI  - Reconstructing and deconstructing the self: cognitive mechanisms in meditation practice
T2  - TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Scientific research highlights the central role of specific psychological processes, in particular those related to the self, in various forms of human suffering and flourishing. This view is shared by Buddhism and other contemplative and humanistic traditions, which have developed meditation practices to regulate these processes. Building on a previous paper in this journal, we propose a novel classification system that categorizes specific styles of meditation into attentional, constructive, and deconstructive families based on their primary cognitive mechanisms. We suggest that meta-awareness, perspective taking and cognitive reappraisal, and self-inquiry may be important mechanisms in specific families of meditation and that alterations in these processes may be used to target states of experiential fusion, maladaptive self-schema, and cognitive reification.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of meditation has many advantages, including introspection, attentiveness, and relaxation. It benefits both biological and mental processes, thus affecting the sense of personal well-being. This study examined the impact of meditation practice on personal spirituality and personal well-being of women over the age of 20 in Israel. Eighty women, half of whom practiced meditation and half who did not practice on at least a weekly basis (the control group) answered three questionnaires: a demographic questionnaire, a spirituality questionnaire, and a personal wellbeing questionnaire. The study found differences between the control group and the meditation practitioners on the personal well-being and spirituality indices. It also found significant correlations between personal spirituality and personal well-being. The findings support the contribution of meditation practice to personal spirituality and personal well-being.

TI  - Individual Differences in Affective States During Meditation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has shown the positive effects of meditation on physical and mental health, but little is known about what psychological processes occur during meditation. The current study investigated experience of affective states in Zen meditation during a 3-day meditation retreat using a single-case design. We used a novel push-button method to measure affective states and multilevel models to analyze the 6 single-case studies. As expected, we found that participants were more likely to have a no-self/spiritual or joy/elation experience toward the end of a meditation session than toward the beginning. Contrary to what we expected, there was no relationship between the meditation session variables and having an anguish/suffering experience. Individual differences had a non-negligible influence on the relationships for all 3 affective states, meaning that meditation did not produce the same results in the participants. We conclude by discussing how our method can be incorporated into future studies of meditation, or other religious variables.

T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a Buddhist meditation intervention on empathy, perceived stress, mindfulness, self-compassion, and of particular interest, the dispositional tendency to feel empathic concern rather than personal distress when perceiving another as in need, termed altruistic orientation. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=20) or a waiting list control group (n=22). Results indicated a trend towards increases in altruistic orientation in the intervention group-an increase that significantly correlated with meditation time, decreases in perceived stress, and increases in self-compassion and mindfulness. Additionally, compared to the controls, significant increases in mindfulness and self-compassion and a significant decrease in perceived stress were obtained for the intervention group.

This study aimed to explore factors related to participants willingness to engage in psychological interventions from the perspective of patients with epilepsy.Methods: Participants answered a needs assessment questionnaire eliciting information about their illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ)), emotions (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), willingness to participate in psychological interventions, preferences in types of PPI and intervention designs, as well as banners in seeking mental health services.Results: A total of 154 patients with epilepsy participated, with a mean age of 37.3 years (range 16-86 years). Most patients had focal epilepsy (68.2%), and drug-resistant (59.1%). Majority (71.4%) of them indicated a strong willingness to participate in PPI. Out of nine types of PPI, character strengths, mindfulness-based and expressive based interventions were highly preferred. Those with negative illness perception (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.004), and being unemployed (p = 0.048) were more willing to participate in PPE Most participants preferred group rather than individual session, and a shorter duration (30 min) was favored by most.Conclusion: This study captured the self-report willingness to participate in psychological interventions. Findings suggested that psychological interventions delivered in short-group session were highly preferred. Future study is required to determine the feasibility of such design for patients with epilepsy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - EEG changes induced by meditative practices: State and trait effects in healthy subjects and in patients with epilepsy
T2  - REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of meditation on brain activity has been the topic of many studies in healthy subjects and in patients suffering from chronic diseases. These effects are either explored during meditation practice (state effects) or as a longer -term result of meditation training during the resting -state (trait). The topic of this article is to first review these findings by focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) changes in healthy subjects with or without experience in meditation. Modifications in EEG baseline rhythms, functional connectivity and advanced nonlinear parameters are discussed in regard to feasibility in clinical applications. Secondly, we provide a state-of-the-art of studies that proposed meditative practices as a complementary therapy in patients with epilepsy, in whom anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent. In these studies, the effects of standardized meditation programs including elements of traditional meditation practices such as mindfulness, loving -kindness and compassion are explored both at the level of psychological functioning and on the occurrence of seizures. Lastly, preliminary results are given regarding our ongoing study, the aim of which is to quantify the effects of a mindfulness self -compassion (MSC) practice on interictal and ictal epileptic activity. Feasibility, difficulties, and prospects of this study are discussed.

TI  - Effects of Contemplative Dyads on Engagement and Perceived Social Connectedness Over 9 Months of Mental Training A Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Loneliness is a risk factor for depression and other illnesses and may be caused and reinforced by maladaptive social cognition. Secularized classical meditation training programs address social cognition, but practice typically occurs alone. Little is known about the effectiveness of contemplative practice performed in dyads.OBJECTIVE To introduce and assess the effectiveness of contemplative dyadic practices relative to classical-solitary meditation with regard to engagement and perceived social connectedness.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The ReSource Project was a 9-month open-label efficacy trial of three, 3-month secularized mental training modules. Replacement randomization was used to assign 362 healthy participants in Leipzig and Berlin, Germany. Eligible participants were recruited between November 11, 2012, and February 13, 2013, and between November 13, 2013, and April 30, 2014. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted.INTERVENTIONS Breathing meditation and body scan (the presence module), loving-kindness meditation and affect dyad (the affect module), and observing-thoughts meditation and perspective dyad (the perspective module).MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were self-disclosure and social closeness. Engagement measures included compliance (ie, the mean [95% margin of error] number of meditation sessions that a participant engaged in per week), liking, and motivation to practice.RESULTS Thirty participants dropped out after assignment to 3 experimental groups; 90 participants were assigned to a retest control that did not complete the main outcome measures; 16 participants provided no state-change data for the affect and perspective modules (226 remaining participants; mean age of 41.15 years; 59.3% female). Results are aggregated across training cohorts. Compliance was similar across the modules: loving-kindness meditation (3.78 [0.18] sessions), affect dyad (3.59 [0.14] sessions), observing-thoughts meditation (3.63 [0.20] sessions), and perspective dyad (3.24 [0.18] sessions). Motivation was higher for meditation (11.20 [0.40] sessions) than the dyads (9.26 [0.43] sessions) and was higher for the affect dyad (10.11 [0.46] sessions) than the perspective dyad (8.41 [0.46] sessions). Social closeness increased during a session for the affect dyad (1.49 [0.12] sessions) and the perspective dyad (1.06 [0.12] sessions) and increased over time for the affect dyad (slope of 0.016 [0.003]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 0.012 [0.003]). Self-disclosure increased over time for the affect dyad (slope of 0.023 [0.004]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 0.006 [0.005]), increasing more steeply for the affect dyad (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Contemplative dyads elicited engagement similar to classical contemplative practices and increased perceived social connectedness. Contemplative dyads represent a new type of intervention targeting social connectedness and intersubjective capacities deficient in participants who experience loneliness and in many psychopathologies.

TI  - The Mindful Personality: a Meta-analysis from a Cybernetic Perspective
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dispositional mindfulness (DM), or the tendency to attend to present moment experience, may have important implications for the structure of human personality. However, relationships between DM and the Big Five Model of Personality (BF) have not been definitively established. Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to extend previous investigations of the relationship between DM and the BF, utilizing a larger sample of studies, attending to relational inconsistencies potentially associated with alternative methods of operationalizing DM, conducting the first meta-analysis of the DM subdomains in relation to the BF, and situating the results in a cybernetic model. Results indicate that neuroticism evidenced the strongest, negative relationship with DM and conscientiousness evidenced the strongest, positive relationship with DM, suggesting the mindful personality may be characterized principally by emotional stability and conscientious self-regulation-potentially reflective of an inclination towards the personality metatrait stability. Measurement differences were also observed, with the mindful personality arrived at through the FFMQ differing to some extent from the mindful personality emerging from the MAAS. Broadly, the mindful personality associated with the FFMQ appears to reflect greater personality complexity, with the FFMQ evidencing associations with all five personality factors while the MAAS appears primarily linked with only three personality factors (neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness). Examination of the relationships between the BF and DM at the facet level also suggests unique patterns of association between the DM facets and each of the personality factors.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a web-based mindfulness programme for people with MS with and without a history of recurrent depression
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence shows small positive effects associated with psychological treatments for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). In a recent meta-analysis, the treatment with the largest effect size was a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI).Objectives: We aimed to determine whether an Internet-delivered MBI was beneficial for PwMS. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate history of recurrent depression as a moderator of treatment outcome.Methods: Participants (N = 132) were assessed based on whether they had a history of recurrent depression, then stratified and randomized to MBI or waitlist. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 and 6 months.Results: The MBI group reported significantly improved depressive symptoms (primary outcome) compared with the waitlist (p = 0.046, Cohen's d = 0.39). Those with a history of recurrent depression benefitted significantly more than those without (p = 0.034, d = 0.66). There were benefits for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the MBI, irrespective of depression history (p = 0.009, d = 0.5). Pain interference was less overall in the MBI group (p < 0.001, d = 0.2), but change over time did not differ from waitlist. There were no treatment effects for anxiety, pain severity or fatigue.Conclusion: The Internet-delivered MBI significantly improved depressive symptoms and HRQoL in PwMS. For depression, the benefits were greater for those with a history of recurrent depression.

TI  - Cognitive-Based Interventions for Improving Psychological Health and Well-Being for Parents of Children with Developmental Disabilities: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This review aims to systematically summarize existing evidence to determine the effectiveness of cognitive-based interventions (CBIs) on psychological health and well-being among parents of children with developmental disabilities (DD). Six databases were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from their inception to April 2023. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs was applied to assess the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Twenty-five RCTs involving 1915 participants were identified. The results indicated that CBIs reduced parental stress levels (Hedges' g = - 0.69), depressive symptoms (g = - 0.95), anxiety levels (g = - 0.78), and parental distress (g = - 0.29), and improved parental well-being (g = 0.62) and parent-child relationships (g = 0.43) postintervention compared with the active/inactive control groups. Subgroup analysis of the effectiveness of interventions using mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioural therapy showed positive effects. The favourable intervention duration and participant targets were also identified in this review. Furthermore, the effects of CBIs were impacted by the different types of DD among the children. This review highlighted the positive effects of CBIs on parental stress levels, depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, parental distress levels, parental well-being levels, and parent-child relationships. Future well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effects of MBIs and CBT interventions on children with DD and their parents, as well as the factors and mechanisms of action affecting the efficacy of these interventions.

TI  - Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Its Effects on Psychoimmunological Factors of Chemically Pulmonary Injured Veterans
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF ALLERGY ASTHMA AND IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a treatment program for relieving stress and coping with chronic illnesses. In recent three decades, studies have shown that MBSR has a positive effect on physical and psychological dimensions of chronic illnesses. Chemically pulmonary injured veterans have chronic pulmonary and psychological problems due to mustard gas exposure and complications of Iran-Iraq war. These stresses have negative effects on their general health and immune system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted on psychoneuroimmunology and MBSR in these patients.Forty male pulmonary injured veterans were randomly divided in two groups with 20 participants (MBSR and wait-list control). Then MBSR group received 8 weekly sessions of intervention. We tested mental health based on general health questionnaire (GHQ)-28 questionnaire, health-related quality of life (based on St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ)) and immunity in MBSR groups; before and after intervention "mixed factorial analyses of variance" test was used for analyzing data fpr each dependent variable and appropriate t-tests were done in The necessary condition.Results showed that mental health and health-related quality of life, in MBSR group compared to wait-list control improved [F (1,38)= 26.46, p< 0.001; F (1,38)= 49.52, p< 0.001 respectively] significantly. Moreover, a significant increase was reported in the lymphocyte proliferation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) [F (1,38)= 16.24, p< 0.001], and peripheral blood IL-17 [F (1,38)= 56.71, p< 0.001] However, lymphocyte (CD4+, CD8+, and NK-cell) percentages were not affected significantly [F (1,38)= 2.21, p= 0.14],[F (1,38)= 0.90, p= 0.78] and [F (1,38)= 1.79, p= 0.18], respectively.This study suggests that MBSR may be a new treatment approach for improving immunity and overall health in chemically pulmonary injured veterans.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus loving-kindness mediation (LKM) in depressed patients. Methods: A total of 125 depressed patients diagnosed in the Department of Psychiatry of our hospital were selected as the research subjects and were randomly divided into a control group (n=62) and an observation group (n=63). The control group was treated with conventional psychological intervention, while the observation group was treated with MBCT plus LKM. The therapeutic outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results: At 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after intervention, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores and the scores for introspection and deliberation, forced thinking rumination of symptoms, treatment, ability and social relationships in the observation group were lower than those in the control group, while Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) scores and the scores for psychology, environment, physiology, social relations, self-acceptance, and self-evaluation in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: MBCT plus LKM can effectively improve depression, rumination, mindfulness level, quality of life, the sense of stigma and degree of self-acceptance in depressed patients.

TI  - Examining the Feasibility of a Mindfulness Flow Program for the Hong Kong Archers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions have gained popularity among elite athletes, but their effectiveness in enhancing archery performance has been inconsistent. This study examined the feasibility of a 12-week mindfulness flow program (MFP) specifically designed for the archers and assessed the effect of the MFP on shooting performance. Twelve members of the Hong Kong Archery Team voluntarily participated in the present study. Their shooting performance, anxiety, mindfulness, and flow state were assessed before and after the MFP intervention. The results showed that the MFP was highly feasible, with 100% attendance. The athletes highly enjoyed the MFP sessions (mean rating: 7.9/10). Improved shooting performance, increased mindfulness, and flow state levels, and reduced anxiety were also observed after the intervention. These findings suggest a positive reception from and potential benefits for athletes. However, it is suggested to conduct additional research using randomized controlled trials to explore the program's effects and applicability in enhancing sports performance.

TI  - Loving kindness: the essential Buddhist contribution to primary care.
T2  - Humane health care international
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Loving kindness (metta), a traditional Buddhist concept, implies acting with compassion toward all sentient beings, with an awareness and appreciation of the natural world. The giving of metta, an integral part of Buddhist medicine, has the potential to enhance modern primary health care. Metta must be given with selflessness (saydana), compassion (karuna), and sympathetic joy (mudita). For the believer, Gautama Siddhartha, the Buddha, is the Supreme Healer. His ancient but timeless message of metta is alive and well today, The Dalai Lama being it key proponent. The Buddhist system features several techniques, such as the Noble Eight-Fold-Path and the metta meditations, to keep physicians moving toward metta. One does not have to be a Buddhist to practice metta, or more humane medicine, and the notion of "tender loving care" is spreading in biomedical circles.

T2  - Journal of evidence-based complementary & alternative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mind-body practices that intentionally generate positive emotion could improve health professionals' well-being and compassion. However, the feasibility and impact of clinician training in these practices is unknown. Data were analyzed from 3 online modules offered to health professionals: ( a) Gratitude, ( b) Positive Word, and ( c) Loving-kindness/Compassion meditation. Paired t tests were used to assess pre- to posttraining changes in gratitude (Gratitude Questionnaire), well-being (World Health Organization Well-Being Index), self-compassion (Neff's Self-Compassion Scale), and confidence in providing compassionate care (Confidence in Providing Calm, Compassionate Care Scale). The 177 enrollees included diverse practitioners (nurses, physicians, social workers, and others). Training was associated with statistically significant improvements in gratitude (38.3 ± 4.6 to 39.5 ± 3.3), well-being (16.4 ± 4.0 to 17.9 ± 4.2), self-compassion (39.5 ± 8.1 to 43.1 ± 7.6), and confidence in providing compassionate care (73.3 ± 16.4 to 80.9 ± 13.8; P < .001 for all comparisons). Brief, online training appeals to diverse health professionals and improves their gratitude, well-being, self-compassion, and confidence in providing compassionate care.

TI  - Meditation training modulates brain electric microstates and felt states of awareness
T2  - HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation practice is believed to foster states of mindful awareness and mental quiescence in everyday life. If so, then the cultivation of these qualities with training ought to leave its imprint on the activity of intrinsic functional brain networks. In an intensive longitudinal study, we investigated associations between meditation practitioners' experiences of felt mindful awareness and changes in the spontaneous electrophysiological dynamics of functional brain networks. Experienced meditators were randomly assigned to complete 3 months of full-time training in focused-attention meditation (during an initial intervention) or to serve as waiting-list controls and receive training second (during a later intervention). We collected broadband electroencephalogram (EEG) during rest at the beginning, middle, and end of the two training periods. Using a data-driven approach, we segmented the EEG into a time series of transient microstate intervals based on clustering of topographic voltage patterns. Participants also provided daily reports of felt mindful awareness and mental quiescence, and reported daily on four experiential qualities of their meditation practice during training. We found that meditation training led to increases in mindful qualities of awareness, which corroborate contemplative accounts of deepening mental calm and attentional focus. We also observed reductions in the strength and duration of EEG microstates across both interventions. Importantly, changes in the dynamic sequencing of microstates were associated with daily increases in felt attentiveness and serenity during training. Our results connect shifts in subjective qualities of meditative experience with the large-scale dynamics of whole brain functional EEG networks at rest.

TI  - Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) for Improved Psychological Well-being: A Qualitative Examination of Participant Experiences
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions are reported as being efficacious treatments for a variety of psychological and somatic conditions. However, concerns have arisen relating to how mindfulness is operationalized in mindfulness-based interventions and whether its 'spiritual essence' and full potential treatment efficacy have remained intact. This qualitative study used interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine participant experiences regarding the acceptability and effectiveness of a newly designed secularized intervention called meditation awareness training (MAT) that follows a more traditional Buddhist approach to meditation. Participants (with issues of stress and low mood) reported experiencing improvements in psychological well-being due to receiving MAT. The wider implications are discussed.

TI  - Psychophysiological Responses to a Brief Self-Compassion Exercise in Armed Forces Veterans
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Armed Forces personnel are exposed to traumatic experiences during their work; therefore, they are at risk of developing emotional difficulties such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following traumatic experiences. Despite evidence to suggest that self-compassion is effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD, and greater levels of self-compassion are associated with enhanced resilience, self-compassion in armed forces personnel and armed forces veterans remains under-researched. As a result, it is not known if therapeutic approaches that use self-compassion interventions are an acceptable and effective treatment for this population. Having previously shown that a one-off self-compassion exercise has temporary beneficial psychophysiological effects in non-clinical participants, we conducted this proof-of concept study to investigate whether this exercise is equally beneficial in veterans who had experienced deployment to a combat zone. Additionally, we examined if brief a self-compassion exercise can temporarily reduce hyperarousal symptoms and increase feelings of social connectedness. The current study also investigated the association between PTSD symptom severity, emotion regulation, and self-compassion in 56 veterans. All participants listened to a loving-kindness meditation for self-compassion (LKM-S) and psychophysiological recordings were taken throughout. Psychophysiological effects were observed including heart-rate (HR), skin conductance (SCL), and heart-rate variability (HRV) to determine associations with PTSD and changes in response associated with the self-compassion induction. PTSD symptom severity, dispositional emotion regulation, and self-compassion were measured, and participants also completed state measures of hyperarousal and social connectedness before and after the LKM-S. The findings partially demonstrated that self-compassion can be elicited in a veteran population but there were considerable individual differences in psychophysiological responses. The findings are discussed in light of existing theories of PTSD and self-compassion and the implications of using self-compassion based psychological approaches with veterans.

TI  - Differences between meditators and non-meditators in mindfulness, its components and related qualities
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The study investigated (1) if meditators and non-meditators differ in their levels of mindfulness, attention, acceptance, loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and empathy; and (2) whether and how mindfulness practice affected the above qualities. Methods The 241 participants (18-81 years, M = 40.3, SD = 14.8; 64% female) completed an online questionnaire consisting of scales measuring mindfulness components (mindful attention, acceptance, non-judging), and mindfulness related qualities, including loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and empathy. The participants who reported being meditators (N = 122; 50.4%) were also asked questions about their meditation practice. Results Meditators differed significantly from non-meditators in relation to their levels of mindful attention (t((239)) = 4.80, p < .001, d = .63) and empathy (t(()(239)) = 2.80, p < .01, d = .37) but not for the other mindfulness components or related qualities. Multiple regression analyses indicated that practice variables (years of practice, frequency of practice, and length of session) explained a significant proportion of variance in mindful attention (R-2 = .27, p < .001) and empathy (R-2 = .15, p < .05). Conclusions The present findings are consistent with conceptualizations of mindfulness that focus on the centrality of mindful attention over acceptance and non-judging components, which is consistent with several Buddhist mindfulness traditions. Present findings also demonstrate the importance of practice for the cultivation of mindful attention. Future studies are required to increase our understanding of effects relating to the type of mindfulness undertaken and the influence of practice factors.

TI  - An 18-month meditation training selectively improves psychological well-being in older adults: A secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesAs the world population is ageing, it is vital to understand how older adults can maintain and deepen their psychological well-being as they are confronted with the unique challenges of ageing in a complex world. Theoretical work has highlighted the promising role of intentional mental training such as meditation practice for enhancing human flourishing. However, meditation-based randomised controlled trials in older adults are lacking. We aimed to investigate the effects of meditation training on psychological well-being in older adults.MethodsThis study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02977819), which randomised 137 healthy older adults (age range: 65 to 84 years) to an 18-month meditation training, an active comparator (English language training), or a passive control. Well-being was measured at baseline, mid-intervention, and 18-month post-randomisation using the Psychological Well-being Scale (PWBS), the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment psychological subscale, and composite scores reflecting the meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, insight, and a global score comprising the average of these meditation-based dimensions.ResultsThe 18-month meditation training was superior to English training on changes in the global score (0.54 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.82], p = 0.0002) and the subscales of awareness, connection, insight, and superior to no-intervention only on changes in the global score (0.54 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.82], p = 0.0002) and awareness. Between-group differences in psychological QoL in favour of meditation did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. There were no between-group differences in PWBS total score. Within the meditation group, psychological QoL, awareness, insight, and the global score increased significantly from baseline to 18-month post-randomisation.ConclusionThe longest randomised meditation training conducted to date enhanced a global composite score reflecting the meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, and insight in older adults. Future research is needed to delineate the cognitive, affective, and behavioural factors that predict responsiveness to meditation and thus help refine the development of tailored meditation training.

TI  - Brief Meditation Interventions: Mindfulness, Implementation Instructions, and Lovingkindness
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study 1 evaluated whether a single-session mindfulness meditation with implementation intention (II) instructions would elicit gains in psychological functioning across 2 weeks that exceeded comparison conditions (meditation with no II, sitting quietly [SQ]). Study 2 evaluated whether a 2-session lovingkindness meditation (LKM), which directed compassion toward oneself, others, or both oneself and others, would produce greater positive outcomes than SQ. Participants in all conditions across both studies improved over trials on multiple measures. We succeeded in replicating previous findings that brief mindfulness meditation is associated with enhanced positive affect. Moreover, as we expected, LKM was related to greater self-reported compassion for others compared with controls. However, more generalized effects, indexed by a variety of measures (e.g., acceptance, mindfulness, anxiety, emotion regulation, behavioral measure of volunteerism), did not emerge, thereby indicating a high degree of specificity for effects associated with very brief meditation.

TI  - Mindfulness as a path to fostering time affluence and well-being
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given that time pressure is a widespread and straining phenomenon in modern societies, strategies to alleviate it are increasingly required. Employing a quasi-experimental longitudinal design with an active control group, the present study examined whether practicing mindfulness may attenuate time pressure and lead to more time affluence. Corroborating and extending findings on positive effects of mindfulness practice, the presented longitudinal study suggests that compared with a physically exercising control group, participation in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program leads to increases in time affluence and subjective well-being. Further, a mediation analysis revealed that the effect of increased mindfulness on subjective well-being is partially mediated through this increase in time affluence. As the first longitudinal study suggesting a change of time affluence as a result of participation in an MBSR program, this work enriches the research on mindfulness and time affluence and provides important impetus for future research. Moreover, this research provides an explanation for the well-established effects of mindfulness practice on well-being: increased subjective time affluence plays a mediating role. The paper underlines the importance of considering time affluence as an element of well-being in mindfulness and general psychology research alike.

TI  - Review of the Neural Oscillations Underlying Meditation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Meditation is one type of mental training that has been shown to produce many cognitive benefits. Meditation practice is associated with improvement in concentration and reduction of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, different forms of meditation training are now being used as interventions for a variety of psychological and somatic illnesses. These benefits are thought to occur as a result of neurophysiologic changes. Themost commonly studied specificmeditation practices are focused attention (FA), open-monitoring (OM), as well as transcendental meditation (TM), and loving-kindness (LK) meditation. In this review, we compare the neural oscillatory patterns during these forms of meditation.Method: We performed a systematic review of neural oscillations during FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation practices, comparing meditators to meditation-naive adults.Results: FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation are associated with global increases in oscillatory activity inmeditators compared tomeditation-naive adults, with larger changes occurring as the length of meditation training increases. While FA and OM are related to increases in anterior theta activity, only FA is associated with changes in posterior theta oscillations. Alpha activity increases in posterior brain regions during both FA and OM. In anterior regions, FA shows a bilateral increase in alpha power, while OM shows a decrease only in left-sided power. Gamma activity in these meditation practices is similar in frontal regions, but increases are variable in parietal and occipital regions.Conclusions: The current literature suggests distinct differences in neural oscillatory activity among FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation practices. Further characterizing these oscillatory changes may better elucidate the cognitive and therapeutic effects of specific meditation practices, and potentially lead to the development of novel neuromodulation targets to take advantage of their benefits.

TI  - The Potential for Mindfulness-Based Intervention in Workplace Mental Health Promotion: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThis study aims to intensively evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on mental illness risks (including psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress) and job strain (job control and job demands) for employees with poor mental health.MethodsA longitudinal research design was adopted. In total, 144 participants were randomized to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group participated in MBI for eight weeks. Measurements were collected for both groups at five time points: at pre-intervention (T1), at mid-intervention (T2), at the completion of intervention (T3), four weeks after intervention (T4), and eight weeks after intervention (T5). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed model with two levels was employed to analyze the repeated measurement data.ResultsCompared with the control group, the intercepts (means at T3) for the intervention group were significantly lower on psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress when MBI was completed. Even with the demographic variables controlled, the positive effects remained. For growth rates of prolonged fatigue and perceived stress, participants in the intervention group showed a steeper decrease than did the participants in the control group. Regarding job strain, although the intercept (mean at T3) of job demands showed a significant decline when BMI was completed, the significance disappeared when the demographic variables were controlled. Moreover, the other results for job control and job demands did not show promising findings.ConclusionAs a workplace health promotion program, the MBI seems to have potential in improving mental illness risks for employees with poor mental health. However, there was insufficient evidence to support its effect on mitigating job strain. Further research on maintaining the positive effects on mental health for the long term and on developing innovative MBI to suit job strain are recommended.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program in Iranian HIV/AIDS patients: a pilot study.
T2  - Acta medica Iranica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Psychological or behavioral interventions that attenuate the effects of stress may be useful in promoting immunocompetence and delaying HIV disease progression and CD4 count level. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a behavioral intervention that has as its foundation the practice of insight-oriented (or mindfulness) meditation. In this study, we examined the effects of MBSR upon psychological, physical status and CD4 count of HIV/AIDS infected patients registered at the Positive Club of Imam Khomeini Hospital in 2007. Using a pilot study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a psychological intervention (8-week) that was based on training in mindfulness at the Positive Club of Imam Khomeini Hospital in 2007. Eight 2-hour sessions weekly and a day-long retreat were planned for a group of 10 participants with HIV. We investigated the long-term effects of this approach on psychological and physical status of patients by SCL-90-R and MSCL questionnaires and CD4 count after MBSR and in 3, 6, 9 and 12-month follow-ups. We studied six HIV positive patients. The mean age was 35 +/- 7.7 yrs. There was no significant difference in MSCL scores after MBSR and in 3, 6, 9 and 12 months compared to those before MBSR (P>0.05). There was a significant difference in SCL-90-R score after MBSR compared with before (P=0.05). Nevertheless, in 3, 6, 9 and 12 months no significant differences were seen in SCL-90-R scores relative to those before MBSR (P>0.05). The means of CD4 count, before and after MBSR, and in 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 549 +/- 173.6, 640.2 +/- 189.4, 655.3 +/- 183.4, 638 +/- 167.4, 619.3 +/- 163.2, and 595.2 +/- 165.6, respectively. There was a significant difference in CD4 counts in comparison with those before MBSR (P<0.05). In our study, MBSR had positive effects on psychological status and CD4 count. However, more studies with large sample size are necessary.

TI  - A Qualitative Investigation of a Prenatal Mindfulness Relationship-Based (PMRB) Program to Support Maternal Mental Health and Mother-Baby Relationship During Pregnancy and Post-Partum
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPregnancy and the postpartum period are times of significant transition for women, with changes in maternal physical and mental health. The formation of a relationship between a mother and her baby is vital and has been recognised as laying the foundation for later child development. There is considerable evidence that this early relationship is influenced by a woman's well-being during pregnancy and in the early post-partum period. Mindfulness-based programs have previously revealed positive outcomes, primarily in reducing maternal stress, anxiety, and depression. However, there remains a need for considering the influence of mindfulness on the mother-baby relationship and embodiment during pregnancy and the first trimester post-partum. This study aimed to conduct an in-depth exploration of pregnant women's experiences of a nine-session prenatal mindfulness relationship-based (PMRB) program to support its feasibility.MethodsInformation about pregnant women's (n = 13) experiences of the PMRB program was collected through online interviews during the sessions, including their birth stories. Responses to an open-ended question about how the program had supported them during pregnancy, labour/birth, and the first post-partum trimester were summarised using thematic analysis.ResultsSixteen themes were identified and organised in four categories: (1) expectations and motivations (healthy pregnancy and mental health, non-medicalised birth, contribution to the field); (2) experiences of the PMRB program (positive experiences, shared experience, engagement with mindfulness practices, pain, stress, and anxiety relief); (3) changes attributed to the PMRB program (a new way of responding to stressors, trusting the process, connecting to body, breath, and unborn baby, awareness of the unborn baby as a sentient being); (4) changes attributed to the mindfulness practice (increased mindfulness/self-awareness, stop look listen, embracing the moment, acceptance).ConclusionsThe evaluation suggested the PMRB program may help women cope with pain and emotional challenges and be more connected to their bodies and infant. The program may also help women become more aware of their unborn baby as a sentient being and the influence of their health and mental well-being on the baby development and health. Furthermore, the program may facilitate the mother-baby relationship during pregnancy, post-partum, and breastfeeding.PreregistrationThe trial has been successfully registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) following ethical approval from Bond University Human Research Ethics Committee (BUHREC-Application AS03534, approved 20 December 2022) and allocated the Australian clinical trials registration number (ACTRN): ACTRN12623000679684.

TI  - Validation of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) with Non-Clinical Adolescents
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based programs for adolescents have become increasingly popular, in line with preliminary evidence supporting their positive effects on psychological functioning. More studies are needed to establish the validity of mindfulness measures for adolescents, in particular with regard to gender differences. This study used confirmatory factor analysis to test the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the recently developed Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measures (CAMM) with non-clinical adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (N=562). Additionally, the study aimed to assess the internal consistency of the CAMM with this sample and to determine its convergent validity. All analyses were conducted for the entire sample as well as for males and females separately. Results confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAMM and the internal consistency of the ten CAMM items, and there were no significant gender group differences. The convergent validity was also supported, with significant correlations between CAMM scores and measures of psychological functioning/distress in the expected directions. When considering correlations separately by gender, mindfulness was weakly but significantly correlated with positive affect in females but not in males. All other correlations were comparable across gender. Overall, the CAMM appears to be a reliable and valid mindfulness measure for both boys and girls.

TI  - Long-term outcome of a mental health promotion program in Germany
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mental health promotion programs (MHP) seek to reduce sub-syndromal symptoms of mental distress and enhance positive mental health. This study evaluates the long-term effects of a mindfulness-based MHP program (Life Balance') provided by health coaches in a multi-site field setting on mental distress, satisfaction with life and resilience. Using a controlled design, propensity score matching was used to select a control group for participants of the MHP. The total study sample (N=3624) comprised 83% women, with a mean age of 50years. Data was collected via mailings 1 year after study entry. Results suggest participants experience reduced emotional distress at 12-month follow-up, with a medium between-group effect size (d=0.40) for those participants who showed clinically relevant symptoms of mental distress at study entry. The effects of the program were more pronounced in participants with higher initial distress scores. New cases of psychopathological symptoms were prevented in 1 of 16 participants. Satisfaction with life and resilience were enhanced significantly. Our data suggest Life Balance' shows long-term effectiveness and indicate it is possible to design MHP programs that serve as both primary and indicated prevention, and that these programs can be applied on a population basis.

TI  - An Energizing Microintervention: How Mindfulness Fosters Subjective Vitality Through Regulatory Processes and Flow Experience at Work
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Can adopting one's morning routines influence employees' experiences throughout the day? To answer this focal question, we examine the daily effects of a brief meditation in the morning on well-being throughout the day considering spillover effects from the home to the work domain and back. To identify the dominant underlying mechanisms of this daily spillover, we draw on the personality systems interactions theory that distinguishes between autonomous self-regulation and effortful self-control as two psychological processes that reflect the regulation of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in alignment or contradiction with one's interests, values, and goals. Accordingly, we hypothesized that meditating in the morning before work fosters autonomous self-regulation and reduces effortful self-control in the work domain, which subsequently facilitates the experience of flow at work and hence fosters subjective vitality in the home domain after work. A quasi-experimental daily-diary study over 10 days with a brief 10-min mindfulness intervention during the final 5 days with 78 participants (588 day-level data points) supported most of our predictions. More specifically, our data suggest a positive indirect effect of the intervention on subjective vitality in the evening via self-regulation and flow experience. However, there was no indirect effect of the intervention on subjective vitality via self-control. The results help to clarify how a mindfulness-based intervention can influence distinct regulatory processes and well-being, crossing boundaries between the work and home domains.

TI  - A pilot study of a mindfulness informed yoga intervention in young people with psychosis
T2  - EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To determine the acceptability and safety of a mindfulness informed yoga intervention as adjunct to usual care for young people with early psychosis. Methods People aged 16-25 years attending a community-based specialist early psychosis clinic were invited to participate in a 12-week yoga intervention. The intervention consisted of 1-h weekly classes of mindfulness informed yoga. Acceptability was measured by uptake, attendance and participants' satisfaction. Safety was measured by incidence of physical injury, participants' level of comfort, distress and anxiety during the sessions, and the following mental health outcomes: positive and negative psychotic, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, sleep quality and functioning. Results Of those who consented to the study, 80% (12) participated and on average attended 4.4 yoga classes. There were no physical injuries and participants reported minimal distress and anxiety. Post-intervention, there was a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and an improvement in function. Conclusions Mindfulness-based yoga interventions are both acceptable and safe as an intervention for youth with early psychosis. Though numbers were small, the study shows promise for yoga as a potentially useful intervention. Importantly, there was no deterioration in mental health outcomes. A larger trial evaluating clinical effectiveness is now timely.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo ascertain how midwives perceived attending a mindfulness course impacted on their professional practice, particularly in regard to any stress they experienced at work.DesignA qualitative study using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine midwives.SettingA large maternity Trust in the United Kingdom.InterventionAn eight-week mindfulness course, adapted from mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.FindingsFour superordinate themes were identified as follows: being challenged and committing, containing the self, reconnecting and moving forward with confidence. Focusing on the present moment enabled participants better to identify the boundary between self and other. This led to an increased sense of control and a reconnection with and reframing of relationships with colleagues and the women in their care.Key conclusionsMindfulness may provide an effective way to address the high levels of stress, role dissatisfaction and workplace bullying found in midwifery, by improving both the working environment and patient care. The pivotal role of positive workplace relationships in this process resonates with other nursing research and with contemporary philosophical thought.Relevance to clinical practiceThis study adds to a body of evidence which suggests investing in the well-being of midwifery staff improves both job satisfaction and women's experiences of care.

TI  - Mindfulness and reduced cognitive reactivity to sad mood: Evidence from a correlational study and a non-randomized waiting list controlled study
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive Reactivity (CR) refers to the degree to which a mild dysphoric state reactivates negative thinking patterns, and it has been found to play a key causal role in depressive relapse. Although Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) directly aims to address this mechanism of CR, the relationship between mindfulness and CR has not been tested to date. Using a cross-sectional design (Study 1; n = 164) and a non-randomized waiting list controlled design (Study 2; MBCT [n = 181 vs. waiting list [it = 211), the authors examined the relationship between naturally occurring levels of mindfulness (Study 1) and MBCT (Study 2) on the one hand, and CR on the other hand. In line with predictions, it was found that (a) trait mindfulness is significantly negatively correlated with CR, even when controlled for current depressive symptoms and prior history of depression (Study I), and that (b) MBCT, compared to a matched control group, significantly reduces CR, and that this effect of MBCT on reduction of CR is mediated by a positive change in mindfulness skills (Study 2). Results provide first evidence for the claim that mindfulness practices in MBCT are designed to address the process of CR. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Yoga-Based Group Intervention for In-patients With Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders-A Qualitative Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Yoga may pose a promising complementary therapy in the multimodal treatment of in-patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, to date, no studies have qualitatively examined in-patients' with SSD experiences of Yoga as well as their perceptions of its limitations and benefits as a treatment component. This qualitative study aimed to explore for the first time the mechanisms and processes of Yoga-based Group Intervention (YoGI) for in-patients with SSD in Germany by asking for their subjective experiences. Findings could serve as a preliminary basis for developing an effective and evidence-based YoGI manual tailored to this patient group.Materials and Methods: In total, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted directly after YoGI, for which responses were either noted down by hand or audio-recorded. The interview guide was pilot-tested and consisted of 14 questions to explore the personal articulated experiences of participation in YoGI from in-patients with SSD. Positive, negative, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were assessed during a diagnostic interview and through questionnaires. The interview data was transcribed, coded by two independent researchers, and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. The research team collaboratively discussed emerging categories to reduce redundancy and form meaningful themes and subthemes.Results: The analysis revealed seven main themes. YoGI was perceived as feasible and focusing on individual adaptation, captured by the theme inclusivity. Nevertheless, participants encountered challenges; thus, physical limitations need to be considered. While practising together, participants experienced interconnectedness and developed a mindful stance as they accepted their limitations and adapted exercises with self-compassion. Patients described that following the flow of the asanas required physical persistence, which ultimately led many participants to experience confidence and relaxation. YoGI affected symptom representation as heightened awareness led participants to notice impeding as well as improved symptoms.Conclusion: YoGI showed various promising effects on in-patients with SSD. Future research should examine to what extent these effects can be sustained and how the mindful approach during YoGI can be transferred to areas outside the Yoga class. Furthermore, a randomised controlled trial could investigate the effectiveness of a manualised YoGI.

TI  - Mind-Body Practices for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Mind-body practices are increasingly used to provide stress reduction for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health.Methods: This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD.Results: The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal.Conclusions: Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care.

TI  - Toward a brain theory of meditation
T2  - MEDITATION
M3  - Review
CP  - International Conference on Meditation
CL  - Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci, Allahabad, INDIA
AB  - The rapidly progressing science of meditation has led to insights about the neural correlates of focused attention meditation (FAM), open monitoring meditation (OMM), compassion meditation (CM) and loving kindness meditation (LKM), in terms of states and traits. However, a unified theoretical understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in meditation-related functions, including mindfulness, is lacking. After reviewing the main forms of meditation and their relationships, the major brain networks and brain states, as well as influential theoretical views of consciousness, we outline a Brain Theory of Meditation (BTM). BTM takes the lead from considerations about the roles of the major brain networks, i.e., the central executive, salience and default mode networks, and their interplay, in meditation, and from an essential energetic limitation of the human brain, such that only up to 1% of the neurons in the cortex can be concurrently activated. The development of the theory is also guided by our neuroscientific studies with the outstanding participation of Theravada Buddhist monks, with other relevant findings in literature. BTM suggests mechanisms for the different forms of meditation, with the down-regulation of brain network activities in FAM, the gating and tuning of network coupling in OMM, and state-related up-regulation effects in CM and LKM. The theory also advances a leftward asymmetry in top-down regulation, and an enhanced interhemispheric integration, in meditation states and traits, also with implications for a theoretical understanding of conscious access. Meditation thus provides a meta-function for an efficient brain/mind regulation, and a flexible allocation of highly limited and often constrained (e.g., by negative emotion and mind wandering) brain activity resources, which can be related to mindfulness. Finally, a series of experimental predictions is derived from the theory.

TI  - Enjoying food without caloric cost: The impact of brief mindfulness on laboratory eating outcomes
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions have been increasingly applied to treat eating-related problems ranging from obesity to eating disorders. Yet few studies have empirically examined the mechanisms of a mindful approach to eating. The current studies examine the potential of brief mindfulness instructions to enhance the psychological and behavioral dimensions of eating.Methods: In three experiments (total N = 319 undergraduates), we examined whether brief mindfulness instructions would enhance the positive sensory experience involved in tasting food as well as healthy eating behaviors.Results: Relative to distraction control instructions, the first two studies demonstrated that brief mindfulness instructions increased the enjoyment of a commonly pleasurable food (chocolate; Study 1), and a food with generally more mixed associations (raisins; Study 2). The third study replicated and extended these findings to show that brief mindfulness instructions also led to lower calorie consumption of unhealthy food relative to distracted or no-instruction control conditions, an effect mediated by greater eating enjoyment.Conclusions: Findings demonstrated the power of brief mindfulness instructions to positively impact both health-relevant behavior and sensory experience associated with eating food. Implications for both theory and clinical applications of mindfulness are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Adults Living with HIV/AIDS: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Review
AB  - This meta-analysis examined the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on stress, psychological symptoms, and biomarkers of disease among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Comprehensive searches identified 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria (N=1059; M age=42years; 20% women). Participants had been living with HIV for an average of 8years (range=<1-20years); 65% were currently on antiretroviral therapy. Between-group analyses indicated that depressive symptoms were reduced among participants receiving the MBIs compared to controls (d+=0.37, 95% CI 0.03, 0.71). Within-group analyses showed reductions in psychological symptoms (i.e., less anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms) and improved quality of life over time among MBI participants (d+s=0.40-0.85). No significant changes were observed for immunological outcomes (i.e., CD4 counts) between- or within-groups. MBIs may be a promising approach for reducing psychological symptoms and improving quality of life among PLWHA. Studies using stronger designs (i.e., randomized controlled trials) with larger sample sizes and longer follow-ups are needed to clarify the potential benefits of MBIs for PLWHA. ResumenEste metaanalisis examino los efectos de las intervenciones basadas en la atencion plena (MBI) sobre el estres, los sintomas psicologicos y los biomarcadores de enfermedades entre las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA. Las busquedas exhaustivas identificaron 16 estudios que cumplieron con los criterios de inclusion (N=1059; M edad=42 anos, 20% mujeres). Los participantes habian estado viviendo con VIH durante un promedio de 8 anos (rango=<1 a 20 anos); el 65% estaba actualmente en tratamiento antirretroviral. Los analisis entre grupos indicaron que los sintomas depresivos se redujeron entre los participantes que recibieron los MBI en comparacion con los controles (d+=0.37; 95% CI 0.03, 0.71). Los analisis dentro del grupo mostraron reducciones en los sintomas psicologicos (es decir, menos ansiedad, menos sintomas depresivos) y una mejor calidad de vida con el tiempo entre los participantes con MBI (d+s=0.40-0.85). No se observaron cambios significativos en los resultados inmunologicos (es decir, recuentos de CD4) entre grupos o dentro de ellos. Los MBI pueden ser un enfoque prometedor para reducir los sintomas psicologicos y mejorar la calidad de vida entre las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA. Se necesitan estudios que utilicen disenos mas fuertes (es decir, ensayos controlados aleatorios) con tamanos de muestra mas grandes y seguimientos mas largos para aclarar los beneficios potenciales de los MBI para personas que viven con VIH/SIDA.

TI  - Development and validation of the Mindfulness Insight Scale
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) that incorporate components of traditional Buddhist practices are widely used in Western countries. However, most MBIs omit a central Buddhist idea that mindfulness promotes three crucial insights (the inevitability of suffering, impermanence, and interconnection) that are alleged to enhance human functioning. To enable testing hypotheses about insight, we developed the Mindfulness Insight Scale (MIS) with three adult samples: n = 365 Thai residents (sample 1), n = 429 Thai residents (sample 2); and n = 484 UK residents (sample 3). Analysis with sample 1 showed a two-level structure of six factors loaded onto by 3 higher order factors, the latter corresponding to the three Buddhist insights. Analyses with samples 2 and 3 replicated this model in both Thai and UK participants. In testing convergent and divergent validity with samples 2 and 3, the MIS had most of the expected associations with conceptually related constructs. To test discriminant validity, the insights of samples 1 and 2 (Thai residents, who have much exposure to Buddhist teaching) were compared with sample 3 UK residents (who do not). As expected, Thai residents had higher insight than UK residents. Findings support the MIS as a useful measure of Buddhist insights.

TI  - Appreciative Joy in Buddhism and Positive Empathy in Psychology: How Do They Differ?
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Appreciative joy, as one of the four immeasurables in Buddhism, refers to feeling happy for people, and it is cultivated by appreciative joy meditation (AJM). There is a debate regarding whether appreciative joy is conceptually the same as positive empathy (empathy for others' positive experiences); thus, this report empirically tests the similarities and differences between appreciative joy and positive empathy. Study 1 recruited a sample of 317 general participants using an online survey and evaluated the similarities and differences between the Appreciative Joy Scale (AJS) and the Positive Empathy Scale (PES) on the outcome variables of altruism, envy, and subjective well-being. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the AJS and PES were independent of one another, and hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that AJS accounted for more variances on altruism than the PES. Study 2 recruited 119 participants in an experiment in a laboratory setting and compared the effects of AJM and the psychological operation of positive empathy in a matched setting on self-reported emotions and interpersonal attitudes. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that AJM generated significantly more other-focused positive emotions (e.g., love) in comparison with the positive empathy condition. These two studies supported that the concept and psychological operation of positive empathy differ from appreciative joy and AJM in Buddhism. In particular, the results in terms of altruism and other-focused positive emotions supported the conceptual analysis that appreciative joy directly involves kind intentions toward the target, whereas positive empathy does not necessarily do so.

TI  - Pilot Study to Gauge Acceptability of a Mindfulness-Based, Family-Focused Preventive Intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF PRIMARY PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to conduct a test of acceptability of a new model for family-focused drug prevention programs for families of early adolescents. An existing evidence-based behavioral intervention, the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP), was adapted to include concepts and activities related to mindfulness and mindful parenting (an extension of mindfulness to the interpersonal domain of parent-child relationships). The foundation for this innovative intervention approach stems from research on the effects of mind-body treatments involving mindfulness meditation and the function of stress and coping in relation to parenting and parent well-being. One group of families participated in a seven-week pilot of this mindfulness-enhanced version of SFP. Results of a mixed-method implementation evaluation suggest that the new intervention activities were generally feasible to deliver, acceptable to participants, and perceived to yield positive benefits for family functioning and parent psychological well-being. The next phase of this research will involve curriculum refinement based upon results of this initial study, and a larger pilot efficacy trial will be conducted.

TI  - Differential effects of mindfulness meditation conditions on repetitive negative thinking and subjective time perspective: a randomized active-controlled study
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivePreliminary findings suggest that different kinds of meditation could work on diverse cognitive and psychological processes. The present study aimed at disentangling the effects of three mindfulness techniques on mental rumination and subjective time perspective. Design: 75 young healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: mindful breathing, body scan, observing-thoughts meditation and an active control condition. The meditation groups practiced mindfulness daily and attended weekly group meetings for 8 weeks, while the control group was involved in reading and discussing a book about mindfulness. Main outcome measures: Self-report measures of mindfulness skills, ruminative thinking, attitude towards time, anxiety, depression and personality traits. Results: In all meditation conditions, analysis of covariance showed a significant improvement in mindfulness skills compared to the control group. We found a specific effect of mindful breathing in reducing participants' tendency to brooding and in increasing their positive vision of the future, compared to all other conditions. Conclusions: As expected, we found some differential effects: breathing meditation helped practitioners to train more effectively their ability to disengage from maladaptive ruminative thoughts, which could be reflected in a more optimistic attitude toward the future. These results provide useful information to structure better mindfulness-based interventions.

TI  - Associations of Five Facets of Mindfulness With Self-Regulation in College Students
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness has been associated with positive mental health functioning across a range of constructs, including self-regulation. Most of this research, however, has investigated mindfulness as a unidimensional domain. Few studies have examined the relationships between specific facets of mindfulness and particular dimensions of self-regulation, including delay of gratification and emotion regulation, despite relevance for mindfulness-based interventions. Two hundred and seventy-eight undergraduate college student participants completed a series of questionnaires examining dispositional mindfulness, difficulties with emotion regulation, and delay of gratification skills. Linear regressions investigated the associations between five facets of mindfulness and each of the two components of self-regulation. Findings revealed that describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreacting mindfulness facets were negatively associated with difficulties with emotion regulation, and that observing, acting with awareness, and nonjudging mindfulness facets were positively associated with delay of gratification skills, after accounting for the effects of the other mindfulness subscales. These preliminary findings may have important clinical relevance, as greater self-regulation has critical implications for social, emotional, and academic functioning.

TI  - Mindfulness and Athlete Burnout: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This review aims to identify, appraise, and synthesize studies reporting the relationship between mindfulness and athlete burnout and the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on athlete burnout. Methods: Studies were identified through searching six electronic databases using combinations of three groups of keywords and manual search. Two independent reviewers screened the searched studies, extracted data of the included studies, and assessed the study quality. The extracted data were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: Ten studies consisting of two controlled trials, six surveys, and two interview studies met the inclusion criteria. The two controlled trials had weak methodological quality, and the remaining studies were of moderate to high research quality. Results of controlled trials and interview research generally showed that MBIs had positive effects in burnout prevention. Meta-analytic results indicated a negative association between mindfulness and burnout. Conclusions: There is some evidence showing that mindfulness was negatively associated with athlete burnout. However, given the small number of interventions and qualitative studies, there is limited evidence on whether MBIs are useful in preventing athlete burnout. More studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

TI  - Upward spirals of positive emotions counter downward spirals of negativity: Insights from the broaden-and-build theory and affective neuroscience on the treatment of emotion dysfunctions and deficits in psychopathology
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This review integrates Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions wills advances in affective neuroscience regarding plasticity in the neural circuitry of emotions to inform the treatment of emotion deficits within psychopathology. We first present a body of research showing that positive emotions broaden cognition and behavioral repertoires, and in so doing, build durable biopsychosocial resources that support coping and flourishing mental health. Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive-emotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typified by emotional dysfunctions.

T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cancer survivors often experience physical and psychological symptoms that may affect their daily activities and quality of life. A mindfulness-based psychoeducation for cancer survivors, (MindCAN) program, has been established to help cancer survivors manage their physical and psychological symptoms. This study aimed to explore perceptions of participants who attended the MindCAN program. Methods A descriptive qualitative study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Purposive sampling was used to recruit adult cancer survivors. They attended the MindCAN program that was conducted once a week for 8 weeks, comprising education and mindfulness practice. Two focus group interviews were conducted to elicit the participants' perceptions of the program. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was performed to identify essential themes and subthemes. Trustworthiness, including creditability, confirmability, dependability, and transferability were ascertained. Results A total of 13 participants were recruited. Most of whom were Chinese, female, and single. The participants' perceptions were documented in five major themes: heightened awareness of the self, enriching body experiences through mindfulness practice, cultivating powerful minds and positive emotions, integrating mindfulness to daily life, and embracing interpersonal mindfulness. Conclusion Overall, the MindCAN program received positive comments from cancer survivors. They reported increased self-awareness, pleasant body experiences, positive thinking and emotions, and relaxation. Future research is required to test the effectiveness of the program.

TI  - Exploring the potential contributions of mindfulness and compassion-based practices for enhancing the teaching of undergraduate ethics courses in philosophy
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - There are numerous ethical theories from which faculty may choose to teach in undergraduate philosophical ethics courses. Whether learning such theories results in ethical behavior change remains an open question. If one of the goals of teaching ethics is to support ethical behavior, then alternative approaches are merited. Within the past decades, there has been a growing emphasis on mindfulness and compassion-based practices in particular, as applied to psychotherapy in the field of psychology. Such findings have bearing on ways in which compassion-based practices might be fruitful in the philosophical ethics classroom. This article will identify issues with the dominant approach to teaching philosophical ethics, focusing on the need for a bridge between theory and action. It will also explore the potential benefits of utilizing mindfulness in the classroom, with a focus on compassion-based practices such as loving-kindness, to contribute to meeting this need to enhance the teaching of undergraduate philosophical ethics.

AB  - In this paper we investigate compassion and its place within mindfulness-based approaches. Compassion is an orientation of mind that recognizes pain and the universality of pain in human experience and the capacity to meet that pain with kindness, empathy, equanimity and patience. We outline how learning to meet pain with compassion is part of how people come to live with chronic conditions like recurrent depression. While most mindfulness-based approaches do not explicitly teach compassion, we describe how the structure of the programme and teachers' embodiment enable participants to cultivate compassion in the landscape of suffering. We describe a case example of how this process unfolded for someone through mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.

TI  - The Influence of Compassion Meditation on the Psychotherapist's Empathy and Clinical Practice: A Phenomenological Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mindfulness and compassion meditation practices have repeatedly been shown to have a positive impact on empathy and prosocial behavior. This study examines the perceived influence of compassion meditation on the psychotherapist's empathy and clinical practice, beyond benefits already gained from a practice of mindfulness meditation. Three psychotherapists, who had already been practicing regular mindfulness meditation, engaged in compassion meditation training over a 4-week period. Repeated semistructured interviews were conducted before and after the 4-week period, as well as 1 month later. Phenomenological analysis of the interview data showed a perceived influence of compassion meditation on four main aspects labelled as follows: (a) The therapist's relation to self, (b) Experiencing empathy, (c) Living a therapeutic relationship, and (d) Integrating change. Challenges and other stumbling blocks on these practices on compassion were also addressed by participants. These findings provide evidence for the inclusion of compassion meditation training in psychotherapy training curricula, as well as in burnout-prevention workshops.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe study investigated the effects of a short video app guided loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on college students' mindfulness, self-compassion, positive psychological capital, and suicide ideation. The purpose of the study is to investigate the intervention effect of LKM training on suicidal ideation among college students with the help of the short video application and to provide an empirical basis for the exploration of early suicide intervention strategies for college students.MethodsWe recruited 80 college students from a university in China. The final 74 eligible participants were divided into two groups: app use group (n = 37) and the control group (n = 37). The app group accepted an 8-week app use interference, while the control group underwent no interference. We measured four major variable factors (mindfulness, self-compassion, positive psychological capital, and suicide ideation) before and after the app use intervention.ResultsIn the app group, self-compassion and positive psychological capital were significantly higher, and suicide ideation was significantly lower than the control group. In the control group, there were no noticeable differences in any of the four variables between the pre-test and post-test.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that the short video app guided LKM may help to improve self-compassion, and positive psychological capital, and reduce suicide ideation. The finding of the short video app-guided LKM's effect extends our understanding of the integrative effects of positive psychology and digital media on the reduction of suicide ideation.

TI  - Buddhist philosophy for the treatment of problem gambling
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL ADDICTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: In the last five years, scientific interest into the potential applications of Buddhist-derived interventions (BDIs) for the treatment of problem gambling has been growing. This paper reviews current directions, proposes conceptual applications, and discusses integration issues relating to the utilisation of BDIs as problem gambling treatments. Method: A literature search and evaluation of the empirical literature for BDIs as problem gambling treatments was undertaken. Results: To date, research has been limited to cross-sectional studies and clinical case studies and findings indicate that Buddhist-derived mindfulness practices have the potential to play an important role in ameliorating problem gambling symptomatology. As an adjunct to mindfulness, other Buddhist-derived practices are also of interest including: (i) insight meditation techniques (e.g., meditation on 'emptiness') to overcome avoidance and dissociation strategies, (ii) 'antidotes' (e.g., patience, impermanence, etc.) to attenuate impulsivity and salience-related issues, (iii) loving-kindness and compassion meditation to foster positive thinking and reduce conflict, and (iv) 'middle-way' principles and 'bliss-substitution' to reduce relapse and temper withdrawal symptoms. In addition to an absence of controlled treatment studies, the successful operationalisation of BDIs as effective treatments for problem gambling may be impeded by issues such as a deficiency of suitably experienced BDI clinicians, and the poor provision by service providers of both BDIs and dedicated gambling interventions. Conclusions: Preliminary findings for BDIs as problem gambling treatments are promising, however, further research is required.

TI  - A Complementary Intervention to Promote Wellbeing and Stress Management for Early Career Teachers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The educational climate and culture in our schools present a variety of environmental (contextual) factors that influence teacher wellbeing, job satisfaction, and work-related stress. The magnitude of contextual factors cannot be ignored, and directing attention towards the environment teachers face daily is essential. Primary (organisational)-level interventions are documented in organisational health and wellbeing literature; however, to provide teachers with stress management strategies for promoting wellbeing, attention must also be directed towards secondary (individual)-level interventions. The present study addressed the issue of stress management techniques for early career teachers (n = 24) and aimed to contribute to the research surrounding complementary interventions (CIs) for educators. The intervention was designed to include strategies that operated through cognitive and physiological mechanisms that regulated the stress response and increased awareness of behaviours, emotions, and reactivity. The self-report measures included perceived stress, attention awareness, subjective wellbeing, burnout, and job-related affective wellbeing. The results indicated a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress and increases in attention awareness and subjective wellbeing. The salivary cortisol levels (waking and resting) decreased from baseline to week 6, and the pre- and post-session salivary cortisol levels indicated an immediate decrease in cortisol for weeks 4 to 6.

TI  - The Many Roads to Mindfulness: A Review of Nonmindfulness-Based Interventions that Increase Mindfulness
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have become increasingly popular for treating various physical and mental disorders. An increase in mindfulness levels through the teaching of mindfulness meditation is the most well-studied mechanism of MBIs. Recent studies, however, suggest that an increase in mindfulness is also observed in physical or psychosocial interventions not explicitly labeled as MBIs, or what the authors call non-MBIs. The authors aimed to review what non-MBIs can increase mindfulness levels despite not explicitly teaching mindfulness meditation. Design: The authors conducted a literature search for studies that included a non-MBI study arm measuring pre- and postintervention mindfulness levels using one of the following eight validated self-reported mindfulness questionnaires: Five-Faceted Mindfulness Questionnaire, Mindful Awareness and Attention Scale, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, Toronto Mindfulness Scale, Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale, Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills, Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, and Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised. The authors identified 69 non-MBI study arms from 51 independent studies of the non-MBI itself or as active controls of an MBI under investigation. The authors documented or calculated, if not provided, effect sizes (ES) for changes in mindfulness levels following these interventions. Results: Among the 69 non-MBI arms, 36 showed no effect for change in mindfulness (ES <0.20), 3 were indeterminate (no ES available or unable to calculate), 13 had small effects (0.20 < ES <0.5), 13 had medium effects (0.50 < ES <0.80), 3 had large effects (0.80 < ES <1.3), and 1 had a very large effect (ES >1.3) for change in mindfulness. Conclusions: Analysis of the characteristics of non-MBIs with significant increases in mindfulness levels suggested some commonalities between MBIs and non-MBIs, shedding light on a spectrum of mindfulness-related interventions and the possibility that there are many roads to developing mindfulness.

TI  - The Need, Feasibility and Willingness to Explore "Meditation on Twin Hearts" as a Self-administered Tool for Mental Health Management among Transgender Women: An Exploratory Survey
T2  - COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hijras are the transgender community and have been socio-economically marginalized and hence their mental healthcare needs to be addressed. This was a descriptive, qualitative study, conducted in Mysore, India to examine the mental health status of 33 transgender women (TGW) and their response to the "Meditation on Twin Hearts (MTH)" intervention. Assessment of anxiety, depression and suicidality was carried out before the meditative session followed by a single session of MTH. Their feedback on meditation experience was collected, coded, and transformed into quantitative data. Among total participants, 39.4% of TGW exhibited severe anxiety, 21.2% has severe depression and 75.8% of them were at suicidal risk. Depression was positively correlated with anxiety and suicidal behavior. Most participants reported MTH was useful with signs of improvements in mental state. Thus, a single session of MTH has shown good signs of improvement in mental state among TGW.

TI  - Effectiveness of behavioral activation and mindfulness in increasing reward sensitivity and reducing depressive symptoms - A randomized controlled trial
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reward insensitivity is a potential key mechanism regarding the maintenance of depression. However, there is a lack of research examining and comparing the effectiveness of different psychological interventions in modifying reward insensitivity. This four-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated a two-week online intervention. After screening for eligibility, a total of 336 participants were randomized, and 224 participated perprotocol. Participants were assigned to either a) behavioral activation, b) mindfulness and gratitude, c) a combination of both, or d) a waitlist control condition. They received videos and implemented daily exercises. Reward sensitivity and depressive symptoms served as primary outcomes. Behavioral activation and mindfulness significantly improved depressive symptoms and reward sensitivity. However, the effects of behavioral activation were not superior. The combination treatment versus the waiting group was insignificant regarding reward insensitivity. Explorative analyses revealed that all intervention groups reduced anhedonia substantially. Our findings imply that brief online interventions with behavioral activation and mindfulness-based approaches can impact reward insensitivity, while effects for a combination were less clear. Nonetheless, our results do not allow us to infer the differential effectiveness of the interventions. There is a clear need for treatments better targeting maintaining factors of depression, such as reward insensitivity. Clinical trial registration number: NCT05402150

TI  - Upshots of Intrinsic Traits on Social Entrepreneurship Intentions among Young Business Graduates: An Investigation through Moderated-Mediation Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social entrepreneurship has recently become a much-desired area of research for academia, practices, and policymaking. Natural or cognitive personal thoughtfulness like loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion trigger individual intentions towards the social entrepreneurial venture. In this process of individual social entrepreneurial intention personality trait plays a very vital role, such as entrepreneurship resilience. For this study, a purposive sampling technique was incorporated and data was collected from 631 business and management sciences students. Data is analyzed by SPSS 23 and for the hypothesis testing, we used the bootstrap analysis of Hayes PROCESS v3.5. This study depicts that LKM has a positive significant impact on compassion and no significant impact on social entrepreneurship intentions while resilience strengthens the direct relationship of compassion with social entrepreneurship and the indirect relationship of LKM with social entrepreneurship via compassion. This study contributes to solving the economic and social problems over the globe especially by boosting the LKM and resilience traits so that the young graduate commence social entrepreneurship. This study helps the academician and policymakers to adopt strategies through which they can encourage youth to indulge in social entrepreneurial ventures solve the social problem and decrease unemployment.

TI  - Experimental Mindfulness Intervention in an Emergency Department for Stress Management and Development of Positive Working Environment
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions have increasingly gained the interest of health professionals in the last decade, especially practices that are short, economical, easily accessible, and physically, cognitively, and psychologically compelling. Nurses of Emergency Departments are a special, dynamic, but at the same time vulnerable group of health professionals who work in shifts and face multiple challenges. Considering the recent literature and the fact that stress and a hostile work environment are the top ranked health professionals' challenges, there is a need for a further study of the use of mindfulness. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the application of mindfulness on nurses in the Emergency Department on several factors related to daily nursing practice and that directly affect these specific health professionals. This experimental study was performed on 14 participating nurses in the Emergency Department of a Public General Hospital in Athens, randomized into two groups: a control and an intervention group. The data collection tools were two digital smart devices, participatory observation, and semi-structured interviews. By practicing mindfulness meditation, the participating nurses in the intervention group showed improvement in their cognitive functions (attention, thinking, memory, concentration), professional interpersonal relationships, personal satisfaction and communication with patients and caregivers, sleep rate, negative emotions, and behaviors. The findings suggest that the application of mindfulness practices should be considered an easy, affordable, economical, accessible, and effective method that nurses can use to strengthen and empower themselves, enjoying its multiple benefits. The effectiveness of the application of mindfulness remains an important issue for future research in other health professionals as well.

TI  - Impact of Meditation on Mental Health Outcomes of Female Trauma Survivors of Interpersonal Violence With Co-Occurring Disorders: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was a randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of meditation practice on the mental health outcomes of female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders. Sixty-three female trauma survivors were randomly assigned to the meditation condition and the control condition. Treatment conditions consisted of a 6-week meditation curriculum that was influenced by Tibetan meditation tradition and focused on breathing, loving kindness, and compassion meditation. Clients in the meditation condition made significant changes in mental health symptoms (t = 5.252, df = 31, p = .000) and trauma symptoms (t = 6.009, df = 31, p = .000) from pre-treatment to post-treatment, whereas non-significant changes were observed among the control condition clients. There were significant group differences between clients in the meditation condition and in the control condition on their mental health symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.438, p = .001, and trauma symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.395, p = .001, with a generally large effect size of eta squared .127 and .146, respectively. In addition, significantly more clients in the meditation condition achieved reliable change in mental health symptoms (35.5% vs. 8.3%) and trauma symptoms (42.3% vs. 4.8%) than clients in the control condition. Significance of the study is discussed with respect to the empirical evidence of meditation practice as a complementary behavioral intervention for treating female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective We examined positive and negative religious coping as moderators of the relation between physical limitations, depression, and desire for hastened death among male inmates incarcerated primarily for murder. Methods Inmates over the age of 45years who passed a cognitive screening completed face-to-face interviews (N=94; mean age=57.7years; SD=10.68). Multiple regression analyses included age, race/ethnicity, parole belief, physical health, positive or negative religious coping, and all two-way interactions represented by the product of health and a religious coping variable. Results Older inmates and those who reported greater levels of positive religious coping endorsed fewer symptoms of depression, whereas those who reported greater levels of negative religious coping endorsed more symptoms of depression. Inmates who reported higher levels of depression endorsed a greater desire for hastened death. The effect of physical functioning on desire for hastened death is moderated by negative religious coping such that those who endorsed higher levels of negative religious coping reported a greater desire for hastened death. Conclusions Examinations of religious/spiritual practices and mindfulness-based interventions in prison research have assumed a positive stance with regard to the potential impact of religious/spiritual coping on physical and mental health. The current findings provide cautionary information that may further assist in selection of inmates for participation in such interventions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - PEC innovation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Given the importance of compassion and cultural humility in healthcare providers, the study aspired to investigate the effects of a brief mindfulness practice on compassion and cultural humility in health professions students.Methods: A quantitative, one-group pre-test/post-test study was conducted with 58 participants from undergraduate health profession education programs in the United States. Participants completed questionnaires measuring mindfulness, compassion, and cultural humility before and after engaging in an eight-minute loving-kindness meditation exercise three to four times per week for two weeks.Results: There were statistically significant increases in mindfulness, compassion, and cultural humility after participants engaged in the brief loving-kindness meditation exercise, with small to moderate effect sizes.Conclusion: Brief mindfulness practices may be helpful for cultivating essential qualities such as compassion and cultural humility in health professions students.Innovation: The findings add to the research gap about the effects of mindfulness on health professions students' compassion and cultural humility. Using mindfulness as a training tool in health professions education may foster compassion, cultural humility, and mindfulness in health professions students who will become healthcare providers, addressing individual health concerns but also broader social issues related to social justice and health equity.

TI  - The effects of a combination of cognitive interventions and loving-kindness meditations (C-METTA) on guilt, shame and PTSD symptoms: results from a pilot randomized controlled trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Trauma-related guilt and shame are crucial for the development and maintenance of PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). We developed an intervention combining cognitive techniques with loving-kindness meditations (C-METTA) that specifically target these emotions. C-METTA is an intervention of six weekly individual treatment sessions followed by a four-week practice phase.Objective: This study examined C-METTA in a proof-of-concept study within a randomized wait-list controlled trial.Method: We randomly assigned 32 trauma-exposed patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis to C-METTA or a wait-list condition (WL). Primary outcomes were clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (CAPS-5) and trauma-related guilt and shame. Secondary outcomes included psychopathology, self-criticism, well-being, and self-compassion. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention phase and after the practice phase.Results: Mixed-design analyses showed greater reductions in C-METTA versus WL in clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (d = -1.09), guilt (d = -2.85), shame (d = -2.14), psychopathology and self-criticism.Conclusion: Our findings support positive outcomes of C-METTA and might contribute to improved care for patients with stress-related disorders. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00023470).C-METTA is an intervention that addresses trauma-related guilt and shame and combines cognitive interventions with loving-kindness meditations.A proof-of-concept study was conducted examining C-METTA in a wait-list randomized controlled trialC-METTA led to reductions in trauma-related guilt and shame and PTSD symptoms.Antecedentes: La culpa y la verguenza asociadas al trauma son criticas para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del trastorno de estres postraumatico (TEPT). Se desarrollo una intervencion combinando tecnicas cognitivas y meditaciones de bondad amorosa (C-METTA) que se enfoca especificamente en estas emociones. El C-METTA es una intervencion semanal individual de seis semanas seguidas de una fase de practica de cuatro semanas.Objetivo: El estudio evaluo el C-METTA mediante un estudio de prueba de concepto dentro de un ensayo clinico aleatorizado comparado con lista de espera.Metodos: Se asigno aleatoriamente a 32 pacientes expuestos a trauma que tuviesen algun diagnostico segun el DSM-5 al grupo C-METTA o a la lista de espera. Los resultados primarios fueron los sintomas asociados al TEPT evaluados por un clinico (CAPS-5, por sus siglas en ingles) y la culpa y verguenza relacionadas a trauma. Los resultados secundarios fueron la psicopatologia, la autocritica, el bienestar y la autocompasion.Resultados: Los analisis de diseno mixto mostraron mayores reducciones en los sintomas asociados al TEPT evaluados por un clinico (d = -1.09), en la culpa (d = -2.85), la verguenza (d = -2.14), la psicopatologia y la autocritica en el grupo C-METTA en comparacion con el grupo control. Hubo un mayor incremento en la autocompasion con un tamano del efecto grande. La culpa y la verguenza se redujeron en la fase de intervencion y este efecto se mantuvo estable durante la fase de practica.Conclusion: Los hallazgos son consistentes con resultados positivos del C-METTA y podrian contribuir a mejorar el cuidado de los pacientes con trastornos relacionados con el estres. El estudio fue registrado en el Registro Aleman de Ensayos Clinicos (DRKS00023470).

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction to manage affective symptoms and improve quality of life in gay men living with HIV
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine whether MBSR groups would help gay men living with HIV improve psychosocial functioning and increase mindfulness compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU). Methods: 117 participants were randomized 2:1 to MBSR or TAU. No new psychosocial or psychopharmacological interventions were initiated within 2 months of baseline. Standardized questionnaires were administered pre-, postintervention and at 6 months. An intent-to-treat analysis found significant benefits of MBSR: at post-intervention and 6 months follow up, MBSR participants had significantly lower avoidance in IES and higher positive affect compared to controls. MBSR participants developed more mindfulness as measured by the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) including both TMS subscales, curiosity and decentering, at 8-week and 6 months. For the sample as a whole, increase in mindfulness was significantly correlated with reduction in avoidance, higher positive affect and improvement in depression at 6 months. MBSR has specific and clinically meaningful effects in this population.

TI  - The effectiveness of three mobile-based psychological interventions in reducing psychological distress and preventing stress-related changes in the psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune network in breast cancer survivors: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial
T2  - INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A growing body of literature shows that psychological distress is not only a major threat to psy-chological well-being but can also have a significant impact on physical health. In cancer patients, it can negatively affect prognosis and posttreatment recovery processes. Since face-to-face psychological interventions are often inaccessible to cancer patients, researchers have recently been focusing on the effectiveness of eHealth adaptations of well-established approaches. In this context, there has been a call for high-quality randomised controlled trials that would allow for a direct comparison of different approaches, potentially addressing different needs and preferences of patients, and also for more systematic research focusing on how psychological interventions affect not only psychological but also biological markers of stress. Both of these questions are addressed in the present study.Methods: A randomised controlled trial will be carried out to test and compare the effectiveness of three eight-week eHealth programmes for the mental health support of cancer patients. All programmes will be delivered through the same application for mobile devices MOU MindCare. N = 440 of breast cancer survivors will be recruited at the end of their adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both) and randomly assigned to one of the three interventions - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Cancer (MBCT-Ca), Positive Psy-chology (PP), or Autogenic Training (AT) - or the treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. Psychological and biological markers of stress and adaptive functioning will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), three-month follow-up (T2), and nine-month follow-up (T3). Primary outcomes will include heart-rate variability and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, general quality of life, and positive mental health. Secondary outcomes will include the levels of serum cortisol and immunomarkers, sleep quality, fatigue, com-mon health symptoms, and several transdiagnostic psychological variables that are expected to be specifically affected by the MBCT-Ca and PP interventions, including dispositional mindfulness, emotion regulation, self-compassion, perceived hope, and gratitude. The data will be analysed using the mixed model repeated mea-sures (MMRM) approach.Discussion: This trial is unique in comparing three different eHealth interventions for cancer patients based on three well-established approaches to mental health support delivered on the same platform. The study will allow us to examine whether different types of interventions affect different indicators of mental health. In addition, it will provide valuable data regarding the effects of stress-reducing psychological interventions on the biomarkers of stress playing an essential role in cancer recovery processes and general health.

TI  - Happiness, love, and compassion as antidotes for anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compared the relative effectiveness of happiness, love, and compassion as antidotes for anxiety. Participants were 208 undergraduates averaging 18.9 years of age, 58% female and 42% male. They self-reported emotions at baseline, after an anxiety induction, and after a happiness, love, or compassion induction; emotions were induced by recalling autobiographical memories. All three positive emotions significantly reduced anxiety, but happiness and love yielded significantly greater reductions than compassion. As a secondary dependent variable, anger showed a similar pattern of results, being significantly reduced by happiness and love but not by compassion. Thus, the relative effectiveness of these positive emotions in relieving both anxiety and anger was not a function of their superordinate emotion category (happiness versus love), but rather was a function of the specific emotion. The findings suggest that we need to better attend to differences between love and compassion in theory, research and practice.

TI  - Mindfulness, pension, and life satisfaction of retired older adults in China: mediation effects of positive and negative affect
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rising average life expectancies and continuing early retirement, China has more retirees than ever before. This study builds from previous research to understand how mental and financial resources affect life satisfaction amongst 1,018 Chengdu, China retirees. Specifically, our research examined how the extents of mindfulness and pension influence life satisfaction and whether the relations are mediated by positive and negative affect (PANA). The SEM results indicate mindfulness has a significant direct (& beta; = 0.26) and an indirect (& beta; = 0.18) effect on life satisfaction via PANA, while the amount of pension has small effect on life satisfaction (& beta; = 0.04) and only via negative affect. The estimates, however, varied by gender and age. Mindfulness had a strong influence on reducing NA for female older adults while substantially increasing PA for male older adults. Additionally, the amount of pension significantly reduced NA for older retirees aged 65 and above. These findings call for increased mindfulness interventions and robust pension policies to better support retired older adults in China.

TI  - Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) for Work-related Wellbeing and Job Performance: A Randomised Controlled Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its potential to concurrently improve work-related wellbeing (WRW) and job performance, occupational stakeholders are becoming increasingly interested in the applications of meditation. The present study conducted the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of meditation on outcomes relating to both WRW and job performance. Office-based middle-hierarchy managers (n = 152) received an eight-week meditation intervention (Meditation Awareness Training; MAT) or an active control intervention. MAT participants demonstrated significant and sustainable improvements (with strong effect sizes) over control-group participants in levels of work-related stress, job satisfaction, psychological distress, and employer-rated job performance. There are a number of novel implications: (i) meditation can effectuate a perceptual shift in how employees experience their work and psychological environment and may thus constitute a cost-effective WRW intervention, (ii) meditation-based (i.e., present-moment-focussed) working styles may be more effective than goal-based (i.e., future-orientated) working styles, and (iii) meditation may reduce the separation made by employees between their own interests and those of the organizations they work for.

TI  - Mindfulness Meditation Leads To Increased Dispositional Mindfulness And Interoceptive Awareness Linked To A Reduced Dissociative Tendency
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA & DISSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissociation is an involuntary defensive mechanism to protect oneself by avoiding unbearable internal conflicts or overwhelming emotions. Cultivating mindful awareness could allow the development of voluntary processes that can offer part of the self-protective function of dissociation while favoring internal integration processes. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of a 7-week Mindfulness Oriented Meditation (MOM) training on healthy individuals' self-reported dissociative experience, mindfulness skills and interoceptive awareness. After the training, in comparison to a waiting-list control group (N = 102), the MOM group (N = 110) showed reduced dissociative tendencies (p < .05), increased dispositional mindfulness (p < .001) and increased interoceptive awareness (in the aspects of not-worrying, self-regulation and body listening; p < .001). Moreover, correlational evidence showed that the more MOM participants increased in mindfulness skills after the training the more they reported increased interoceptive awareness and decreased dissociative functioning (p < .05). Mindfulness skills also improved with more home meditation practice executed by MOM participants (p < .05). These findings were attributed to a possible role of mindfulness meditation in enabling the development of volitional processes that afford psychological safety and integration, in contrast with the involuntary nature of dissociation.

TI  - Buddhist-Inspired Meditation Increases the Value of Calm
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies of meditation have focused on "actual affect" (how people actually feel). We predict that meditation may even more significantly alter "ideal affect" (how people ideally want to feel). As predicted, meditators ideally wanted to feel calm more and excited less than nonmeditators, but the groups did not differ in their actual experience of calm or excited states (Study 1). We ruled out self-selection and nonspecific effects by randomly assigning participants to meditation classes, an improvisational theater class, or a no class control (Study 2). After eight weeks, meditators valued calm more but did not differ in their actual experience of calm compared with the other groups. There were no differences in ideal or actual excitement, suggesting that meditation selectively increases the value placed on calm. These findings were not due to expectancy effects (Study 3). We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how meditation alters affective life.

AB  - We examined predictors of students' adherence to a 10-session online mindfulness program. Undergraduates naive to meditation (N= 169) were recruited from an introductory psychology subject pool. Students completed assessments examining physical and psychological health and were asked to complete a 10-session online mindfulness activity. More than half (53%) of the sample was fully adherent to the program. Better physical health and lower levels of anxiety predicted adherence. We present recommendations for increasing adherence in the clinical use of mindfulness with college students.

TI  - Meditation's impact on default mode network and hippocampus in mild cognitive impairment: A pilot study
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Those with high baseline stress levels are more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While meditation may reduce stress and alter the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN), little is known about its impact in these populations. Our objective was to conduct a "proof of concept" trial to determine whether Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) would improve DMN connectivity and reduce hippocampal atrophy among adults with MCI. 14 adults with MCI were randomized to MBSR vs. usual care and underwent resting state fMRI at baseline and follow-up. Seed based functional connectivity was applied using posterior cingulate cortex as seed. Brain morphometry analyses were performed using FreeSurfer. The results showed that after the intervention, MBSR participants had increased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus compared to controls. In addition, MBSR participants had trends of less bilateral hippocampal volume atrophy than control participants. These preliminary results indicate that in adults with MCI, MBSR may have a positive impact on the regions of the brain most related to MCI and AD. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer-follow-up are needed to further investigate the results from this pilot study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Training the Moral Self: An 8-Week Mindfulness Meditation Program Leads to Reduced Dishonest Behavior and Increased Regulation of Interoceptive Awareness
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesRecent meta-analyses suggest that mindfulness meditation may enhance prosocial behavior, while evidence regarding moral behavior is still scarce. We combined a randomized controlled mindfulness training design with an ecologically valid moral decision-making task (Temptation to Lie Card Game; TLCG), in which participants were tempted to deceive an opponent to increase their monetary payoff.MethodTLCG and self-report measures (in the domains of attention regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation, and change in the perspective of the self) were administered to participants who underwent the mindfulness meditation training (experimental group, n = 44) or were waitlisted (control group, n = 25) twice: before and after the 8-week training.ResultsConcerning moral decision-making, we observed a significant effect involving condition, time, and group. Trained participants deceived significantly less in the post-training as compared with the pre-training phase (p = 0.03), while untrained ones showed no significant change (p = 0.58). In the self-reports, significant effects involving time and group were found for the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) in Self-Regulation, Attention Regulation, Body Listening, and for the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) in Non-Reactivity to inner experience. Trained participants showed a time-related increase in all subscales scores, while untrained ones did not. Finally, a moderation analysis revealed a significant interaction between weekly mindfulness meditation training minutes and MAIA-2 Attention Regulation (post-training) on moral behavior change.ConclusionsOur preliminary results suggest that mindfulness meditation practice decreases self-serving dishonest behavior and increases awareness of one's bodily and emotional state. In particular, the amount of mindfulness meditation practice predicted moral behavior change in practitioners who reported the highest regulation of attention towards internal bodily signals.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Urban Youth
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess the general acceptability and to assess domains of potential effect of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and at-risk urban youth.Methods: Thirteen-to twenty-one-year-old youth were recruited from the pediatric primary care clinic of an urban tertiary care hospital to participate in 4 MBSR groups. Each MBSR group consisted of nine weekly sessions of MBSR instruction. This mixed-methods evaluation consisted of quantitative data-attendance, psychologic symptoms (Symptom Checklist 90-Revised), and quality of life (Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent Edition)-and qualitative data-in-depth individual interviews conducted in a convenience sample of participants until interview themes were saturated. Analysis involved comparison of pre-and postintervention surveys and content analysis of interviews.Results: Thirty-three (33) youth attended at least one MBSR session. Of the 33 who attended any sessions, 26 youth (79%) attended the majority of the MBSR sessions and were considered "program completers." Among program completers, 11 were HIV-infected, 77% were female, all were African American, and the average age was 16.8 years. Quantitative data show that following the MBSR program, participants had a significant reduction in hostility (p = 0.02), general discomfort (p = 0.01), and emotional discomfort (p 0.02). Qualitative data (n = 10) show perceived improvements in interpersonal relationships (including less conflict), school achievement, physical health, and reduced stress.Conclusions: The data suggest that MBSR instruction for urban youth may have a positive effect in domains related to hostility, interpersonal relationships, school achievement, and physical health. However, because of the small sample size and lack of control group, it cannot be distinguished whether the changes observed are due to MBSR or to nonspecific group effects. Further controlled trials should include assessment of the MBSR program's efficacy in these domains.

TI  - Effects of a Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss Intervention on Long-term Psychological Well-being Among Adults with Obesity: Secondary Analyses from the Supporting Health by Integrating Nutrition and Exercise (SHINE) Trial
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study tested whether a mindfulness-based intervention for obesity that included components aimed at emotion regulation and mindful eating improved psychological outcomes including stress, anxiety, positive emotion, and depression, during the intervention period and at longer-term follow-up.Methods Adults with obesity (N=194) were randomized to a 5.5-month diet-exercise weight loss intervention with or without mindfulness training focused on emotion regulation and mindful eating. Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness and psychological well-being, which were planned secondary outcomes, at baseline, at mid-intervention (3 months), and at 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline (maintenance period). Mixed effects models and linear regression were used to test between- and within-group changes in psychological well-being. This study also explored whether changes in mindfulness (from baseline to each 6 and 18 months post-baseline) mediated the effects of intervention arm on changes in psychological outcomes during those respective time periods. Finally, this study explored whether changes in mindfulness from baseline to 6 months mediated the effects of intervention arm on changes in psychological outcomes from baseline to 18 months.Results Participants randomized to the mindfulness arm had significant increases in positive emotions at all follow-up times compared to controls. There were statistically significant increases in mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and reflection, as well as decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms at 12 months compared to control participants. These changes remained significant for psychological flexibility and reflection at 18 months. There were no significant differences in perceived stress. Among mindfulness participants, greater increases in mindfulness from 6 to 18 months were associated with greater positive emotions and psychological flexibility as well as lower perceived stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and rumination at 18 months, adjusting for 6-month values. Mediation analyses indicated that randomization to the mindfulness intervention arm was associated with 6-month increases in mindfulness, and these increases were in turn associated with improved psychological outcomes at 6 months and 18 months. Changes from baseline to 18 months did not mediate 18-month changes in psychological outcomes.Conclusions Mindfulness training in emotion regulation and mindful eating may provide greater longer-term psychological well-being benefits in non-clinical populations with obesity compared to conventional diet-exercise interventions.

TI  - Comparing the Effects of Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM), Music and LKM Plus Music on Psychological Well-Being
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a meditative practice directing caring feelings toward self and others, is a popular, evidence-base approach to increasing well-being. Music listening is also a popular form of emotion regulation used to enhance well-being. This interdisciplinary study evaluated a novel intervention called Convergence-combining LKM with accompanying classical guitar music-and its effects on adults' well-being, mindfulness, compassion and self-compassion outcomes. Convergence was compared to active control groups LKM-only and Music-only regarding their relative effectiveness in improving these outcomes. Participants (N = 78; aged 18 to 69 years; 90% females; recruited from the general public) were assigned to either the Convergence, LKM-only, or Music-only condition. Each condition received a 2-hour workshop, involving psychoeducation, three prerecorded meditations, and group enquiry and discussion. Participants were assessed at pre-program, post-program, and 4-week follow-up. Findings revealed that Convergence, LKM-only and Music-only were equally effective interventions, producing improvements in dependent variables with small effect sizes. There was no additive effect of the components when delivered together as Convergence. Significant correlations were found between the amount of home practice, and mindfulness and self-compassion at follow-up. LKM, music listening and Convergence all provide brief, evidence-based alternatives for improving well-being. Practical and theoretical implications are provided, as well as recommendations for future research.

TI  - Enhancing relaxation states and positive emotions in physicians through a mindfulness training program: A one-year study
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research on mindfulness has focused mainly on stress-related negative symptoms and short-term effects. In contrast, the present article focuses on the impact of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on improving well-being (i.e. relaxation states and related positive emotions) in a longitudinal study for a period of one year. A randomized controlled trial in a sample of 42 physicians was used. The intervention group participated in an 8-week MBSR program, with an additional 10-month maintenance period and completed measures of mindfulness and relaxation at pre-intervention, post-intervention and after 10 months. Heart rate measures were also obtained. Significant improvements in favor of the experimental group compared with the control group on the levels of mindfulness and relaxation (including positive emotional states, such as at ease/peace, renewal, energy, optimism, happiness, acceptance, and even transcendence) were obtained after eightweeks. Remarkably, change magnitudes (effect size) significantly increased at the end of the maintenance period after a year, especially for mindfulness and positive energy. Additionally, heart rate significantly decreased for the intervention group and maintained a year after the beginning of the treatment. Results are relevant in terms of practical consequences for improving health and well-being in this population and also in terms of cost-efficiency.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: Evidence of brief mental training
T2  - CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Although research has found that long-term mindfulness meditation practice promotes executive functioning and the ability to sustain attention, the effects of brief mindfulness meditation training have not been fully explored. We examined whether brief meditation training affects cognition and mood when compared to an active control group. After four sessions of either meditation training or listening to a recorded book, participants with no prior meditation experience were assessed with measures of mood, verbal fluency, visual coding, and working memory. Both interventions were effective at improving mood but only brief meditation training reduced fatigue, anxiety, and increased mindfulness. Moreover, brief mindfulness training significantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning. Our findings suggest that 4 days of meditation training can enhance the ability to sustain attention; benefits that have previously been reported with long-term meditators. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Gray Matter Changes in Adolescents Participating in a Meditation Training
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation has shown to benefit a wide range of conditions and symptoms, but the neural mechanisms underlying the practice remain unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the structural brain changes due to the practice by examining volume, density, or cortical thickness changes. However, these studies have focused on adults; meditation's structural effects on the adolescent brain remain understudied. In this study, we investigated how meditation training affects the structure of the adolescent brain by scanning a group of 38 adolescents (16.48 +/- 1.29 years) before and after participating in a 12-week meditation training. Subjects underwent Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA), a program that mainly incorporates elements from mindfulness meditation and yoga-based practices. A subset of the adolescents also received an additional control scan 12 weeks before TARA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess gray matter volume changes pre- to post-training and during the control period. Subjects showed significant gray matter (GM) volume decreases in the left posterior insula and to a lesser extent in the left thalamus and left putamen after meditation training. There were no significant changes during the control period. Our results support previous findings that meditation affects regions associated with physical and emotional awareness. However, our results are different from previous morphometric studies in which meditation was associated with structural increases. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the differences between the adolescent brain and the adult brain.

TI  - Meditation-Based Treatment Yielding Immediate Relief for Meditation-Naive Migraineurs
T2  - PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation is gaining popularity as an effective means of managing and attenuating pain and has been particularly effective for migraines. Meditation additionally addresses the negative emotional states known to exist with migraines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of meditation as an immediate intervention for reducing migraine pain as well as alleviating emotional tension, examined herein as a negative affect hypothesized to be correlated with pain. Twenty-seven migraineurs, with two to ten migraines per month, reported migraine-related pain and emotional tension ratings on a Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 10) before and after exposure to a brief meditation-based treatment. All participants were meditation-naive, and attended one 20-minute guided meditation session based on the Buddhist "loving kindness" approach. After the session, participants reported a 33% decrease in pain and a 43% decrease in emotional tension. The data suggest that a single exposure to a brief meditative technique can significantly reduce pain and tension, as well as offer several clinical implications. It can be concluded that single exposure to a meditative technique can significantly reduce pain and tension. The effectiveness and immediacy of this intervention offers several implications for nurses. (C) 2014 by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing

TI  - Mindfulness-based programmes and 'bigger than self' issues: protocol for a scoping review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionMindfulness-based programmes (MBPs) have an established, growing evidence base as interventions to optimise health, well-being and performance of individual participants. Emerging evidence suggests that MBPs also enhance prosociality, encouraging individuals to contribute to positive social change. This study focuses on the potential of MBPs to facilitate development of participants' inner resources that support prosocial shifts. The review seeks to detect shifts in MBP benefit from individual toward 'bigger than self', informing and empowering individual and collective responses to complex societal and global issues. The review aims to map current literature on MBPs and social change, into a descriptive overview with commentary on quality, trends, theoretical models and gaps, and on how training in MBPs potentially enables individual and collective responses to societal and global issues. Recommendations for future directions for researchers seeking to advance this evidence base, and practitioners developing innovative MBPs for this purpose will be provided.Methods and analysisA scoping review of peer-reviewed literature will be undertaken and reported on according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidance. Systematic searches of four scientific databases will be undertaken to identify potentially eligible articles published from all time to current date. Data will be extracted using an extraction template and analysed descriptively using narrative synthesis.Ethics and disseminationThis scoping review involves no human participants, so ethics is not required. Findings will be shared through professional networks, conference presentations and journal publication.

T2  - MEDITATION
M3  - Review
CP  - International Conference on Meditation
CL  - Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci, Allahabad, INDIA
AB  - All of us consciously experience the world around us through our sensory modalities. Empirical studies on the relationship between attention and awareness have shown that attention does influence perceptual experience or appearance in addition to better performance in perceptual tasks. The practice of meditation also changes perceptual experience in addition to better perceptual performance. For example, a study with Sahaj Samadhi meditators utilizing negative color afterimages had shown that concentrative meditation influences visual experience. However the brain regions that are modified by meditation practice leading to such changes in visual experience or awareness are still not known. Here using negative color afterimages in a functional MRI study, we investigated the brain mechanisms underlying the changes in visual awareness as a function of attentional enhancement achieved through long-term concentrative meditation practice. We found increased activity in right lateralized inferior occipital and inferior frontal cortex, which suggests the importance of attentional control in modulating visual awareness. The results of this study indicate that the link between attention and conscious experience is possibly changed by meditation practices.

TI  - Teachers' stress and training in a school-based mindfulness program: Implementation results from a cluster randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - School -based mindfulness trainings (SBMT) are a contemporary approach for intervening to promote students' social and emotional skills and well-being. Despite evidence from the larger field of evidence-based social and emotional learning programs demonstrating the importance of high-quality implementation, few studies have investigated factors impacting the implementation of SBMTs, particularly teacher-level influences. The present study addressed this issue by investigating whether teachers' stress, trust in their fellow teachers and principal, and expectations about the program at baseline predicted the quality of their implementation of a SBMT for students. In addition, we examined whether teachers' stress at baseline moderated the effect of training condition on implementation quality. Implementation quality was assessed via observations and teacher self-reports. Results from a sample of British secondary (middle-high) school educators (N = 81) indicated that teachers who felt more supported by their principals at baseline were later observed to implement the SBMT with greater quality, whereas teachers who had more positive expectations about the program felt more confident teaching the course in the future. Teachers' baseline stress moderated the effect of training condition on all measures of implementation quality; among teachers experiencing high stress at baseline, more intensive training led to higher quality implementation. Implications for practitioners and prevention researchers are discussed.

TI  - A multivariate twin study of the genetic association between present moment attention and subjective wellbeing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considerable evidence supports the role of present-moment attention, a central feature of mindfulness, in subjective wellbeing maintenance and enhancement. Yet it is not clear why such a relation exists. This study examined the genetic and environmental contributions of present-moment attention to subjective wellbeing. Consistent with the "generalist genes hypothesis" and prior evidence, we hypothesized that presence and subjective wellbeing would show a substantial genetic correlation and smaller environmental correlation. Using a large epidemiological sample of healthy 16-year-old twins in the United Kingdom (N = 1136 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs), genetic overlap was found between presence and the cognitive component of subjective wellbeing (life satisfaction), and to a lesser extent, the affective component of subjective wellbeing (operationalized as happiness). The non-shared environmental overlap between these constructs was substantial. This study provides the first evidence known to us showing that present-centered attention, a primary component of mindfulness, has both genetic and environmental overlap with subjective wellbeing. The findings have implications for understanding mechanisms by which presence is associated with positive emotions and life satisfaction, and suggest, pending additional research, that mindfulness-based interventions to enhance wellbeing may be best suited to those with a genetic propensity toward mindful presence.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for people with multiple sclerosis - a feasibility randomised controlled trial
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a stressful condition. Mental health comorbidity is common. Stress can increase the risk of depression, reduce quality of life (QOL), and possibly exacerbate disease activity in MS. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may help, but has been little studied in MS, particularly among more disabled individuals.Methods: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and likely effectiveness of a standard MBSR course for people with MS. Participant eligibility included: age > 18, any type of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).Results: Fifty participants were recruited and randomised (25 per group). Trial retention and outcome measure completion rates were 90% at post-intervention, and 88% at 3 months. Sixty percent of participants completed the course. Immediately post-MBSR, perceived stress improved with a large effect size (ES 0.93; p < 0.01), compared to very small beneficial effects on QOL (ES 0.17; p = 0.48). Depression (ES 1.35; p < 0.05), positive affect (ES 0.87; p = 0. 13), anxiety (ES 0.85; p = 0.05), and self-compassion (ES 0.80; p < 0.01) also improved with large effect sizes. At three-months post-MBSR (study endpoint) improvements in perceived stress were diminished to a small effect size (ES 0.26; p = 0.39), were negligible for QOL (ES 0.08; p = 0.71), but were large for mindfulness (ES 1.13; p < 0.001), positive affect (ES 0.90; p = 0.54), self-compassion (ES 0.83; p < 0.05), anxiety (ES 0.82; p = 0.15), and prospective memory (ES 0.81; p < 0.05).Conclusions: Recruitment, retention, and data collection demonstrate that a RCT of MBSR is feasible for people with MS. Trends towards improved outcomes suggest that a larger definitive RCT may be warranted. However, optimisation changes may be required to render more stable the beneficial treatment effects on stress and depression.

TI  - One-on-One Mindfulness Meditation Trainings in a Research Setting
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We created a standardized one-on-one mindfulness meditation intervention with six weekly 90-min training sessions and home practice. The trainings included didactic instruction, discussion and guided meditations, and home-practice guided meditations and mindfulness exercises. Twenty-eight participants completed mindful awareness, nonjudgment, perceived stress, positive and negative affect, and credibility/expectancy scales before and after the intervention. There were no adverse events or unanticipated side effects. Participants' mindful awareness and nonjudgment scores and perceived credibility of the intervention increased after the intervention, while negative affect and perceived stress decreased. There was no change in positive affect. Future research is needed comparing group versus one-on-one formats incorporating participant preference in the randomization, personality, and other predictors as measures.

TI  - Compassion and its role in the clinical encounter - An argument for compassion training
T2  - JOURNAL OF HERBAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Empathic communication, (i.e. emotionally engaging with a patient), is an important part of the therapeutic relationship. It hasbeen shown to improve the health and therapeutic outcomes for patients by improving diagnosis and compliance. In the West, front-line medical professionals, including herbal medicine practitioners, put themselves at risk of burnout and compassion fatigue by giving emotionally intensive care. While treatments for compassion fatigue and burnout are available, another way forward is needed to ensure healthcare professionals do not become ill; one that will enable both patients and healthcare professionals to receive the care needed. In this paper it is argued that compassion, which is defined in this paper, involves different neural circuitry to empathy and can protect healthcare professionals from the effects of stress that can, if not addressed, lead to burnout. Traditional Buddhist meditation techniques such as loving-kindness meditation have been shown to increase compassion in non-meditative states. Short daily sessions of such mediation practices have been shown to improve compassion in a way that protects healthcare professionals from burnout. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Short-Term Effects of Meditation on Sustained Attention as Measured by fNIRS
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive abilities such as attention, memory, processing time, perception, and reasoning can be augmented using some type of intervention. Within the broad range of conventional and unconventional intervention methods used in cognitive enhancement, meditation is one of those that is safe, widely practiced by many since ancient times, and has been shown to reduce stress and improve psychological health and cognitive functioning. Various neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown functional and structural changes due to meditation in different types of meditation practices and on various groups of meditators. Recently, a few studies on meditation have used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study the effects of meditation on cerebral hemodynamics. In this study, we examined the short-term effects of loving-kindness (LK) meditation on sustained attention using behavioral performance measures, physiological outcomes, and cognitive activity as measured by fNIRS in first-time meditators during Stroop color word task (SCWT) performance. Our results indicated that behavioral outcomes, assessed mainly on response time (RT) during SCWT performance, showed a significant decrease after meditation. As expected, physiological measures, primarily pulse pressure (PP) measured after meditation dropped significantly as compared to the before meditation measurement. For the hemodynamic measures of oxygenated-hemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxygenated-hemoglobin (Hb), and total-hemoglobin (HbT), our findings show significant differences in SCWT performance before and after meditation. Our results suggest that LK meditation can result in improvements in cognitive, physiological, and behavioral outcomes of first-time meditators after a short-term session.

TI  - Brief mindfulness-based training and mindfulness trait attenuate psychological stress in university students: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Psychological distress in University settings has grown and became a public health concern. In this context, contemplative practices such as mindfulness have been proposed as a strategy to help students on stress management.Methods: Forty university students (20 female), aged between 18 to 30 years (mean = 24.15; SD = 3.56), with no previous experience with meditation or yoga were recruited at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte and randomized to a mindfulness training (MT) or active control (AC) groups. We analyzed measures of anxiety, affect, stress, as well as state and trait mindfulness in order to evaluate the effects of trait mindfulness and a brief mindfulness intervention in forty healthy young students. Participants were classified as Low (n = 27, females = 13) or High (n = 13, females = 7) Trait Mindfulness by k-means clustering and compared between them using Wilcoxon sum rank test. Furthermore, the sample was randomly allocated to an AC (n = 20, females = 10) or a MT (n = 20, females = 10) group, and mixed analysis of variance was performed to analyze the effect of interventions. The mechanisms and role of trait mindfulness in the intervention was assessed by a moderated mediation analysis.Results: We found that High Trait individuals have lower anxiety trait, anxiety state and perceived stress levels. Only the MT group reduced their anxiety state and perceived stress after the intervention and increased their state mindfulness. Both groups reduced negative affect and cortisol, and no change was found in positive affect. Moderated mediation analysis showed that the training-induced change in state mindfulness mediated the increase in positive affect and the decrease in perceived stress and cortisol, regardless of trait mindfulness. For anxiety state the decrease only occurred in individuals with High Trait Mindfulness.Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that higher trait mindfulness is associated with low levels of psychological distress and that a brief mindfulness-based intervention seems to be useful to reduce distress measures in university students.

TI  - Can mindfulness and acceptance be learnt by self-help?: A systematic review and meta-analysis of mindfulness and acceptance-based self-help interventions
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing evidence that mindfulness and acceptance-based interventions have positive consequences for psychological and physical health. The most well-established of these interventions typically involve relatively large resource commitments, in terms of both the provider and participant. A number of recent studies have begun to explore whether the benefits of such interventions can be generalised to less intensive methods. Methods include pure and guided self-help utilising resources such as books and workbooks, computer programmes and applications and audio-visual materials. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that have evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of low-intensity interventions including mindfulness and acceptance-based components. Fifteen RCTs (7 ACT-based, 4 mindfulness-based and 4 multi-component interventions including elements of mindfulness and/or acceptance) were identified and reviewed. Interventions that included mindfulness and/or acceptance-based components produced significant benefits in comparison to control conditions on measures of mindfulness/acceptance, depression and anxiety with small to medium effect sizes. Engagement with the self-help interventions varied but on average two-thirds of participants completed post-intervention measures. Emerging research into low-intensity mindfulness and acceptance-based interventions is hopeful. Recommendations fOr research and practice are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Staying Well: A Follow Up of a 5-Week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Programme for a Range of Psychological Issues
T2  - COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - 112 women and 37 men, with an average age of 50 years were referred for MBSR training with a range of chronic psychological issues. All participants completed the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (Tennant et al. in Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 5:63, 2007) before and after the mindfulness training programme. A significant overall effect of pre/post training was found and this difference was not related to a specific disorder. The results suggest that a 'brief' dose of MBSR can have a positive impact on measures of well-being in a manner that is not related to patient characteristics. A follow-up of 28 participants confirms that participation in the 5-week Living Mindfully MBSR programme significantly enhances psychological well-being immediately after training, and this benefit is maintained up to 4 years after training. Continued practice in mindfulness meditation showed an insignificant relationship to well-being scores at follow up. Qualitative data suggest that the 5 week MBSR is an effective means of developing emotion regulation and psychological well-being.

TI  - The Relationship between Mindful Attention Awareness, Perceived Stress and Subjective Wellbeing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been suggested that mindfulness is a predictive factor in self-reported perceived stress. The present study aimed to investigate the link between mindful attention awareness, perceived stress and subjective wellbeing without the presence of a complementary intervention to promote mindfulness-based strategies. Methods: The online survey participants (N = 257) were university students enrolled in initial teacher training. Self-report measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI). Results: PWI was negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.550, p = .001), MAAS was negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.567, p = .001) and positively correlated with PWI (r = 0.336, p = .001). The mean score for PSS (M = 20.61, SD = 6.62) was above the reported norm (14.2). Conclusions: The findings suggest that higher levels of mindful attention awareness may be associated with lower levels of perceived stress and higher subjective wellbeing levels and lower levels of perceived stress may be associated with higher subjective wellbeing. The findings confirm that pre-service teachers are a demographic that experiences elevated levels of perceived stress regardless of the stage in initial teacher training programs.

TI  - A systemic response to supporting frontline inpatient mental health staff in coping with the COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to outline the process of supporting frontline inpatient mental health staff in developing ways of coping with COVID-19.Design/methodology/approachA whole system approach was used in formulating and developing support structures with particular focus on relationship-focused coping.FindingsInterventions were developed to support staff in coping with problem-focused (e.g. systemic changes) and emotion-focused challenges (e.g. deaths of colleagues). These included psychoeducation, mindfulness-based meditation and rituals to mark the deaths of colleagues. Staff SPACE (Stopping to Process and Consider Events) sessions were used to support staff in managing the many emotions they were experiencing. Positive psychology-based interventions were used to keep morale up and help people to stay motivated. The process of seeking feedback and making changes was introduced to support staff in feeling heard and having a voice. The maternal or master intervention within each of the above was the relational component.Practical implicationsThis work aimed to boost the emotional and psychological literacy of the system. This will be important in the aftermath of the pandemic and could have many benefits thereafter.Social implicationsThe post-COVID-19 health-care workforce will experience significant challenges in terms of readjustment and recovery. It is important that appropriate measures are put in place to ameliorate this.Originality/valueAn innovative systemic formulation of the impact of COVID-19 on frontline staff, and a coordinated way of dealing with this, is outlined.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness practices have become a common component of daily life in many settings and may serve to bolster resiliency, particularly among university students. This study expanded on our previous work to compare the effects of receiving or not receiving a brief daily mindfulness-based practice in large-scale university courses. Data were collected from 88 participants enrolled in two third-year psychology courses at a university in Southwestern Ontario, Canada at the beginning and the end of the semester. The scripted 'Three-Minute Breathing Space' mindfulness intervention took less than 5 min of class time each day in one course, while the course not receiving the intervention served as a control group. By the end of the semester, the intervention group reported experiencing greater enhancements in positive emotionality, and fewer episodes of mind wandering and distractibility than those in the control group. In contrast, there was no detectable effect on mindfulness or negative emotionality in either group. Those receiving the intervention also reported enjoying the practice, and more than half had used the practice outside the course. Results of this study, and others, suggest that brief mindfulness practices taught in university courses may play a role in promoting mental wellness among students. Future work should consider how this brief practice may be applied more broadly and what other resources might be made available to students.

TI  - Addiction Treatment Intervention: An Uncontrolled Prospective Pilot Study of Spiritual Self-Schema Therapy with Latina Women
T2  - SUBSTANCE ABUSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) is a weekly 8-session, mindfulness-based, manual-guided, individual intervention targeting addiction and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors that integrates cognitive behavioral strategies with Buddhist principles and clients' religious/spiritual beliefs. 3-S is efficacious for reducing drug use and HIV risk behaviors among mixed-gender, methadone-maintained outpatients. The study goal was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of 3-S therapy among urban, low-income Latinas (n = 13) in residential addiction treatment. Data gathered via in-person interviews (baseline, 8 and 20 weeks postentry) showed high rates of 3-S acceptability and positive changes in a number of outcomes relevant to recovery from addiction and to HIV prevention, including impulsivity, spirituality, motivation for change, and HIV prevention knowledge. The study findings are promising; however, a controlled study with longer follow-up is needed to rigorously assess the efficacy of 3-S therapy with Latinas in substance abuse treatment.

TI  - The effectiveness of positive psychological interventions for patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims and ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness of positive psychological interventions on quality of life, positive psychological outcomes and negative psychological outcomes in patients with cancer.BackgroundPatients with cancer often suffer from various psychological problems and have a poor quality of life. Positive psychological interventions have been increasingly applied to patients with cancer, but the results of these studies have not been synthesized.DesignA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials according to PRISMA.MethodsSix English databases and four Chinese databases were searched from the inception to December 2022. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RevMan was used for meta-analysis.ResultsTwenty-nine randomized controlled trials examined the effects of positive psychological interventions including meaning therapy, dignity therapy, positive psychotherapy, mindfulness- based intervention, life review, expressive writing intervention, acceptance and commitment psychotherapy, attention and interpretation therapy, compassion training and spiritual therapy on patients with cancer. Positive psychological interventions significantly improved the quality of life, enhanced positive psychological outcomes including well-being, meaning of life, self-esteem, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy and alleviated negative psychological outcomes including depression, anxiety and hopelessness. However, the heterogeneity of some outcomes was rather high, due to the wide diversity of the interventions included.ConclusionPositive psychological interventions have potentially positive effects on improving quality of life, enhancing positive psychological outcomes and alleviating negative psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity and the lack of follow-up studies, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm the results of our review and to clarify the long-term effects of positive psychological interventions.Relevance to clinical practiceAs feasible psychological interventions, healthcare professionals can consider applying appropriate positive psychological interventions according to the condition of cancer patients.Patient or public contributionNo patient or public contribution.

TI  - Parental mindfulness and externalizing problems in Chinese adolescents: Parenting anxiety and negative parenting as mechanisms
T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The current study aims to examine parenting anxiety and negative parenting practices as intervening variables in the relation between parental dispositional mindfulness and Chinese adolescents' externalizing problems. Background Parental dispositional mindfulness is negatively associated with their adolescents' adjustment difficulties through both positive and negative parenting practices in Western samples. However, research does not support these same pathways of effects among Eastern samples. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative mediators of the link between parental mindfulness and lower adolescent adjustment problems in Eastern cultures. The present study addresses this need by examining parenting anxiety as a mechanism linking parental dispositional mindfulness, negative parenting practices, and Chinese adolescents' externalizing problems. Methods Participants were 624 adolescents (aged from 9 to 18 years, M = 12.69 years, SD = 2.30) and their parents from urban areas in Southeast China. Parents completed questionnaires on their dispositional mindful awareness, parenting anxiety, and negative parenting practices, and adolescents reported on their externalizing problems. Results Structural equation modeling revealed that the indirect relation between parental dispositional mindful awareness and adolescents' externalizing problems was significant, with parenting anxiety and negative parenting practices as the first and second intervening variables. Conclusion The results highlighted the importance of parenting anxiety in the relation between parental mindful awareness and parenting. Implications It suggested that mindfulness-based parenting interventions may help alleviate parenting anxiety, which may further improve parenting behaviors and indirectly decrease adolescents' externalizing problems.

TI  - Coherence Between Emotional Experience and Physiology: Does Body Awareness Training Have an Impact?
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Two fundamental issues in emotion theory and research concern: (a) the role of emotion in promoting response coherence across different emotion systems; and (b) the role of awareness of bodily sensations in the experience of emotion. The present study poses a question bridging the two domains; namely, whether training in Vipassana meditation or dance, both of which promote attention to certain kinds of bodily sensations, is associated with greater coherence between the subjective and physiological aspects of emotion. We used lag correlations to examine second-by-second coherence between subjective emotional experience and heart period within individuals across four different films. Participants were either: (a) experienced Vipassana meditators (attention to visceral sensations), (b) experienced dancers (attention to somatic sensations), and (c) controls with no meditation or dance experience. Results indicated a linear relationship in coherence, with meditators having highest levels, dancers having intermediary levels, and controls having lowest levels. We conclude that the coherence between subjective and cardiac aspects of emotion is greater in those who have specialized training that promotes greater body awareness.

TI  - Mindfulness-based emotional eating awareness training: taking the emotional out of eating
T2  - EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Emotional eating is important to study and address because it predicts poor outcome in weight loss interventions. Interventions have only touched the surface in terms of addressing emotional eating. Mindfulness approaches can address emotional eating by modification of emotion regulation and appetitive traits. The current study involved development of an emotional eating-specific mindfulness intervention and assessment of its effect on appetitive traits associated with emotional eating. Methods Participants (n = 14; age M = 29 years; 90% female) completed baseline and end-of-intervention self-report measures of emotional eating, food-cue reactivity, mindfulness, intuitive eating, emotional impulse regulation, stress, and a behavioural measure of inhibitory control. During the 6-week intervention, mindfulness meditation skills were taught weekly embedded in a psycho-educational curriculum about emotional eating. Results Paired t tests, controlled for type 1 error, revealed significant improvements in food-cue reactivity, intuitive eating, emotional impulse regulation, inhibitory control and stress (ps < 0.05; d: 0.58-1.54). Changes in emotional eating approached significance (p = 0.075, d = 0.66). Conclusion The intervention purposefully did not focus on weight loss and recruited participants who had self-declared difficulties with emotional eating. The positive outcomes suggest that intervening with mindfulness training before weight loss is attempted has the potential to change psychological factors that underpin overeating and undermine weight loss efforts. The study provides proof of principle as a basis to design a randomized control trial to assess rigorously the effectiveness of the intervention as a precursor to a weight loss intervention.

TI  - Mindfulness training for stress management: a randomised controlled study of medical and psychology students
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Distress and burnout among medical and psychology professionals are commonly reported and have implications for the quality of patient care delivered. Already in the course of university studies, medicine and psychology students report mental distress and low life satisfaction. There is a need for interventions that promote better coping skills in students in order to prevent distress and future burnout. This study examines the effect of a seven-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme on mental distress, study stress, burnout, subjective well-being, and mindfulness of medical and psychology students.Methods: A total of 288 students (mean age = 23 years, 76% female) from the University of Oslo and the University of Tromso were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The control group continued with their standard university courses and received no intervention. Participants were evaluated using self-reported measures both before and after the intervention. These were: the 'General Health Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory Student version, Perceived Medical School Stress, Subjective Well-being, and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire' and additional indices of compliance.Results: Following the intervention, a moderate effect on mental distress (Hedges'g 0.65, CI = .41, .88), and a small effect on both subjective well-being (Hedges'g 0.40, CI = .27, .63) and the mindfulness facet 'non-reacting' (Hedges'g 0.33, CI = .10, .56) were found in the intervention group compared with the control group. A higher level of programme attendance and reported mindfulness exercises predicted these changes. Significant effects were only found for female students who additionally reported reduced study stress and an increase in the mindfulness facet 'non-judging'. Gender specific effects of participation in the MBSR programme have not previously been reported, and gender differences in the present study are discussed.Conclusion: Female medical and psychology students experienced significant positive improvements in mental distress, study stress, subjective well-being and mindfulness after participating in the MBSR programme.

TI  - Bracing Later and Coping Better: Benefits of Mindfulness During a Stressful Waiting Period
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - People frequently await uncertain news, yet research reveals that the strategies people naturally use to cope with uncertainty are largely ineffective. We tested the role of mindfulness for improving the experience of a stressful waiting period. Law graduates awaiting their bar exam results either reported their trait mindfulness (Study 1; N = 150) or were instructed to practice mindfulness meditation (Study 2; N = 90). As hypothesized, participants who were naturally more mindful or who practiced mindfulness managed their expectations more effectively by bracing for the worst later in the waiting period and perceived themselves as coping better. Additionally, participants who were low in dispositional optimism and high in intolerance of uncertainty benefited most from mindfulness (relative to control) meditation. These findings point to a simple and effective way to wait better, particularly for those most vulnerable to distress.

TI  - Phenotypic Dimensions of Spirituality: Implications for Mental Health in China, India, and the United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the field of empirical study on religion and spirituality in relation to mental health has rapidly expanded over the past decade, little is known about underlying dimensions of spirituality cross-culturally conceived. We aimed to bridge this gap by inductively deriving potential universal dimensions of spirituality through a large-scale, multi-national data collection, and examining the relationships of these dimensions with common psychiatric conditions. Five-thousand five-hundred and twelve participants from China, India, and the United States completed a two-hour online survey consisting of wide-ranging measures of the lived experience of spirituality, as well as clinical assessments. A series of inductive Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and cross-validating Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) were conducted to derive common underlying dimensions of spirituality. Logistic regression analyses were then conducted with each dimension to predict depression, suicidal ideation, generalized anxiety, and substance-related disorders. Preliminary EFA results were consistently supported by ESEM findings. Analyses of 40 spirituality measures revealed five invariant factors across countries which were interpreted as five dimensions of universal spiritual experience, specifically: love, in the fabric of relationships and as a sacred reality; unifying interconnectedness, as a sense of energetic oneness with other beings in the universe; altruism, as a commitment beyond the self with care and service; contemplative practice, such as meditation, prayer, yoga, or qigong: and religious and spiritual reflection and commitment, as a life well-examined. Love, interconnectedness, and altruism were associated with less risk of psychopathology for all countries. Religious and spiritual reflection and commitment and contemplative practice were associated with less risk in India and the United States but associated with greater risk in China. Education was directly associated with dimensions of spiritual awareness in India and China but inversely associated with dimensions in the United States. Findings support the notion that spirituality is a universal phenomenon with potentially universal dimensions. These aspects of spirituality may each offer protective effects against psychiatric symptoms and disorders and suggest new directions for treatment.

TI  - The neurophysiology of the intervention strategies of Awareness Training Program on emotion regulation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Emotion regulation is essential for healthy living. Previous studies have found that mental training such as compassion meditation could help with emotion regulation. However, the underlying neural mechanism and possible intervention strategies of group-based Mahayana Buddhist intervention involved in emotion regulation are still unclear. This event-related potential (ERP) study investigated how compassion and wisdom meditations, two key components of the Awareness Training Program (ATP), may regulate emotion during different mental processing stages, namely attention deployment, cognitive change, and response modification. Eighty-five middle-aged working adults with moderate stress were voluntarily recruited for this study, using a 128-channel electroencephalogram system. After 7 weeks of training, participants (ATP attendance, n = 42; waitlist control, n = 43) were instructed to view negative pictures while practicing compassion or wisdom meditation, with corresponding priming words. Another normal priming condition and a neutral picture condition were set as control conditions. ERP results in the ATP group showed that negative pictures induced greater prefrontal activity (N400 component) in both compassion and wisdom meditation conditions compared with the normal condition, while the control group showed little difference between the conditions. Significantly higher heart rate variability was found in the compassion but not wisdom meditation when compared with the neutral priming condition. Correspondent changes in behavioural data were also found. Converging evidence showed that compassion meditation training could modulate negative emotion processing in stages of attention deployment, cognitive change, and behavioural responses. The prefrontal lobe could play an important role in the process of emotion regulation by compassion meditation, possibly due to the emphasis of the ATP on contemplative practices.

TI  - The efficacy of compassion training programmes for healthcare professionals: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous exposure to the suffering and death of patients produces certain syndromes such as compassion fatigue in health professionals. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect and the effectiveness of interventions based on mindfulness, aimed at training or cultivating compassion or self-compassion in compassion fatigue, self-compassion, compassion, and compassion satisfaction of health professionals. A systematic review is reported in line with the PRISMA guideline and was registered in PROSPERO. The PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were used. Interventions based on compassion training or cultivation were selected, aimed at health professionals. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The effect size and hetereogeneity of the studies were calculated. Eight articles were selected. Among the programmes for the cultivation of compassion we highlight Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT), Mindfulness and Self-Compassion (MSC), Compassionate Meditation (CM), and Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM). The interventions decreased compassion fatigue and increased compassion, self-compassion, and compassion satisfaction in healthcare professionals. Compassion fatigue in healthcare professionals is due to a deficit in empathic and compassionate skills. Health systems should incorporate programmes based on the cultivation of compassion and self-compassion in order to improve the work conditions and quality of life of health professionals.

TI  - STRESS AND COPING IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: PATHWAYS TO RESILIENCE AND RECOVERY
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted virtually every aspect of daily living, engendering forced isolation and social distance, economic hardship, fears of contracting a potentially lethal illness and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Unfortunately, there is no formula or operating manual for how to cope with the current global pandemic. Previous research has documented an array of responses to mass crises or disasters, including chronic anxiety and posttraumatic stress as well as resilience and recovery. Much can be learned from this research about how people have coped in the past in order to identify strategies that may be particularly effective in managing distress and cultivating resilience during these perilous times. We delineate multiple coping strategies (e.g., behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, loving-kindness practices) geared to decrease stress and promote resilience and recovery. These strategics may be especially effective because they help individuals make meaning, build distress tolerance, increase social support, foster a view of our deep human interconnectedness, and take goal-directed value-driven actions in midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Hypnosis, Meditation, and Self-Induced Cognitive Trance to Improve Post-treatment Oncological Patients' Quality of Life: Study Protocol
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: A symptom cluster is very common among oncological patients: cancer-related fatigue (CRF), emotional distress, sleep difficulties, pain, and cognitive difficulties. Clinical applications of interventions based on non-ordinary states of consciousness, mostly hypnosis and meditation, are starting to be investigated in oncology settings. They revealed encouraging results in terms of improvements of these symptoms. However, these studies often focused on breast cancer patients, with methodological limitations (e.g., small sample size, no control group, and no follow-up). Another non-ordinary state of consciousness may also have therapeutic applications in oncology: self-induced cognitive trance (SICT). It seems to differ from hypnosis and meditation, as it involves the body more directly. Thus, investigating its clinical applications, along with hypnosis and meditation interventions, could improve available therapeutic options in oncology. This article details the study protocol of a preference-based longitudinal controlled superiority trial aiming to assess the effectiveness of 3 group interventions (hypnosis, meditation, and SICT) to improve oncological patients' quality of life, and more specifically CRF, emotional distress, sleep, pain, and cognitive difficulties (primary outcomes). Methods and analysis: A power analysis required a total sample of 160 patients. Main inclusion criteria are: cancer diagnosis, active treatments completed for less than a year, no practice of hypnosis, meditation, or SICT, and presence of at least one of these four symptoms: fatigue, sleep difficulties, depression, or anxiety. Each participant will choose the intervention in which they want to participate (hypnosis, mindful self-compassion meditation, SICT, or no intervention-control group). To test the effectiveness of the interventions, data will be collected by questionnaires and neurobiological measures and directly from the medical record at four time points: before inclusion in the study (baseline); immediately after the intervention; and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. The longitudinal data in each group will then be measured. Discussion: In addition to standard cancer therapies, there is a growing interest from patients in complementary approaches, such as hypnosis, meditation, and SICT. The results of this study will be useful to increase knowledge about short- and long-term effectiveness of 3 group interventions for CRF, emotional distress, sleep, pain, and cognitive difficulties in patients with different cancers.

TI  - Investigation of mindfulness meditation practitioners with voxel-based morphometry
T2  - SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness meditators practice the non-judgmental observation of the ongoing stream of internal experiences as they arise. Using voxel-based morphometry, this study investigated MRI brain images of 20 mindfulness (Vipassana) meditators (mean practice 8.6 years; 2 h daily) and compared the regional gray matter concentration to that of non-meditators matched for sex, age, education and handedness. Meditators were predicted to show greater gray matter concentration in regions that are typically activated during meditation. Results confirmed greater gray matter concentration for meditators in the right anterior insula, which is involved in interoceptive awareness. This group difference presumably reflects the training of bodily awareness during mindfulness meditation. Furthermore, meditators had greater gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus. Both regions have previously been found to be involved in meditation. The mean value of gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus was predictable by the amount of meditation training, corroborating the assumption of a causal impact of meditation training on gray matter concentration in this region. Results suggest that meditation practice is associated with structural differences in regions that are typically activated during meditation and in regions that are relevant for the task of meditation.

TI  - Increased Lucid Dream Frequency in Long-Term Meditators but not Following Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong conceptual and theoretical connections have been made between meditation practice, mindfulness, and lucid dreaming. However, only a handful of empirical studies have evaluated the relationship between lucid dreaming and meditation, and conclusions remain tempered by methodological limitations. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between meditation, mindfulness, and lucid dream frequency using several complementary methods. First, using a cross-sectional design, we evaluated differences in lucid dream frequency between long-term meditators and meditation-naive individuals. Second, we evaluated the relationship between lucid dream frequency and specific facets of trait mindfulness in both meditators and nonmeditators. Third, using a blinded, randomized controlled design, we evaluated the effect of an 8-week mindfulness course on lucid dreaming frequency. Our results show that lucid dreaming is more frequent in long-term meditators than in meditation-naive individuals. In addition, lucid dream frequency in meditation-naive individuals was associated with a tendency to verbalize experience, whereas lucid dream frequency in long-term meditators was associated with observational and decentering facets of trait mindfulness. However, an 8-week mindfulness course did not increase the frequency of lucid dreams. Together, these results support a continuity between increased awareness of waking and sleeping states, provide a novel form of evidence linking meditation training to meta-awareness, and support an association between meditation practice and lucid dreaming, but leave open the specific nature of this connection.

TI  - Mindfulness' Effects on Stress, Coping, and Mood: A Daily Diary Goodness-of-Fit Study
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dispositional mindfulness is often linked to higher positive affect and lower negative affect, and coping with stress has been hypothesized to mediate these links. However, few studies have explicitly tested the ways in which stress appraisals, coping strategies, or coping flexibility (i.e., fit of coping to controllability appraisals) uniquely relate to mindfulness and well-being. Drawing on a stress and coping framework, the present study tested the degree to which (a) lower stress appraisals mediate mindfulness' effects on daily positive and negative affect; (b) daily coping mediates mindfulness' impact on daily positive and negative affect, above and beyond the effects of stress appraisals; and (c) coping flexibility mediates mindfulness' impact on positive and negative affect, above and beyond the effects of stress appraisals and average daily coping. Participants were 157 undergraduate students (mean age = 17.81; 79% women), completing daily diary questionnaires regarding stress appraisals, coping, and affect for 1 week. Results demonstrate that lower average stress appraisals mediated 19% of mindfulness' effects on negative affect; further, average use of some "mindful" emotion-focused coping strategies (i.e., non-self-blame and acceptance) independently mediated 3%-13% of mindfulness' effects on positive and negative affect. Although mindfulness was associated with greater "fit" of problem-focused versus acceptance coping to high controllability appraisals, coping flexibility did not appear to mediate mindfulness' effects on either positive or negative affect. Thus, mindfulness-based stress management interventions may be most effective by promoting mindful coping to complement, rather than replace, problem-focused coping.

TI  - Source-space EEG neurofeedback links subjective experience with brain activity during effortless awareness meditation
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Meditation is increasingly showing beneficial effects for psychiatric disorders. However, learning to meditate is not straightforward as there are no easily discernible outward signs of performance and thus no direct feedback is possible. As meditation has been found to correlate with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity, we tested whether source-space EEG neurofeedback from the PCC followed the subjective experience of effortless awareness (a major component of meditation), and whether participants could volitionally control the signal.Methods: Sixteen novice meditators and sixteen experienced meditators participated in the study. Novice meditators were briefly trained to perform a basic meditation practice to induce the subjective experience of effortless awareness in a progressively more challenging neurofeedback test-battery. Experienced meditators performed a self-selected meditation practice to induce this state in the same test-battery. Neurofeedback was provided based on gamma-band (40-57 Hz) PCC activity extracted using a beamformer algorithm. Associations between PCC activity and the subjective experience of effortless awareness were assessed by verbal probes.Results: Both groups reported that decreased PCC activity corresponded with effortless awareness (P < 0.0025 for each group), with high median confidence ratings (novices: 8 on a 0-10 Likert scale; experienced: 9). Both groups showed high moment-to-moment median correspondence ratings between PCC activity and subjective experience of effortless awareness (novices: 8, experienced: 9). Both groups were able to volitionally control the PCC signal in the direction associated with effortless awareness by practicing effortless awareness meditation (novices: median % of time = 77.97, P = 0.001; experienced: 89.83, P < 0.0005).Conclusions: These findings support the feasibility of using EEG neurofeedback to link an objective measure of brain activity with the subjective experience of effortless awareness, and suggest potential utility of this paradigm as a tool for meditation training.

TI  - Compassion meditation increases optimism towards a transgressor
T2  - COGNITION & EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Past research reveals important connections between meditative practices and compassion. Most studies, however, focus on the effects of one type of meditation (vs. a no-intervention control) on a single expression of compassion (e.g. offering a seat) towards a relatable target (e.g. a person on crutches), without exploring possible mechanisms. Hence, few studies include different types of meditation, active controls, multiple ways to express compassion, unrelatable targets, and potential mediators. To this end, the present study compared the effects of mindfulness meditation with those of compassion meditation on different expressions of compassion towards a convicted murderer. Seventy-four participants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness meditation, compassion meditation, or active control class, or a no-class control. After an 8-week programme, we assessed compassion by giving participants the option of fulfilling a murderer's request that they write him and then coding those letters for empathy, sympathy, forgiveness, and optimism. Participants in the compassion meditation class wrote more optimistic letters compared to participants in the other three conditions, in part because they valued positivity more. No statistically significant differences emerged for the other expressions of compassion. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of how meditation increases compassion towards unrelatable targets.

TI  - Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT): the foundation of the therapeutic model and an overview of its contribution to the treatment of patients with chronic physical diseases.
T2  - Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Nowadays, treatment of chronic illnesses, such as stroke, cancer, chronic heart and respiratory diseases, osteoarthritis, diabetes, and so forth, account for the largest part of expenses in western countries national health systems. Moreover, these diseases are by far the leading causes of mortality in the world, representing 60% of all deaths. Any treatment aimed at targeting them might engage an individual for a large portion of his/her life so that personal and environmental factors can play a crucial role in modulating the person's quality of life and functioning, on top of any medical cure. Anxiety, depression, and distress for examples are not rare in patients with chronic diseases. Therefore, Cognitive and Behavior Therapy research has largely contributed in the last decades in identifying and programming interventions on such aspects as real and perceived social and family support, coping abilities, locus of control, self-efficacy that might help patients living with their chronic disease. More recently, third generation Cognitive-Behavior-Therapies, such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) and Acceptance, and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focused their attention and research efforts on developing intervention models targeting the needs of patients with a chronic disease. This paper has three aims. First is to briefly introduce ACT epistemological (Functional Contextualism) and theoretical (Relational Frame Theory) foundations as a stand point for understanding the peculiarity of ACT as a modern form of Clinical Behavior Analysis. The second aim is to introduce ACT clinical model and its six core processes (acceptance, defusion, present moment, self as a context, values and committed action) as both accountable, in their continuum, for psychological flexibility and inflexibility. Third, to present a brief overview of studies and outcomes of ACT intervention protocols and assessment tools that have been investigated in patients with chronic physical diseases, and namely: diabetes, obesity, epilepsy, and chronic pain.

TI  - Psychological Therapies for Auditory Hallucinations (Voices): Current Status and Key Directions for Future Research
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This report from the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research considers the current status and future directions in research on psychological therapies targeting auditory hallucinations (hearing voices). Therapy approaches have evolved from behavioral and coping-focused interventions, through formulation-driven interventions using methods from cognitive therapy, to a number of contemporary developments. Recent developments include the application of acceptance-and mindfulness-based approaches, and consolidation of methods for working with connections between voices and views of self, others, relationships and personal history. In this article, we discuss the development of therapies for voices and review the empirical findings. This review shows that psychological therapies are broadly effective for people with positive symptoms, but that more research is required to understand the specific application of therapies to voices. Six key research directions are identified: (1) moving beyond the focus on overall efficacy to understand specific therapeutic processes targeting voices, (2) better targeting psychological processes associated with voices such as trauma, cognitive mechanisms, and personal recovery, (3) more focused measurement of the intended outcomes of therapy, (4) understanding individual differences among voice hearers, (5) extending beyond a focus on voices and schizophrenia into other populations and sensory modalities, and (6) shaping interventions for service implementation.

TI  - Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches to Manage Chronic Pain in US Military Populations: Results From a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, 1985-2019
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Review
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches for reducing pain intensity (primary outcome) and depressive symptoms (secondary outcome) as well as improving physical functioning (secondary outcome) among U.S. military personnel living with chronic pain. Studies were retrieved from bibliographic databases, databases of funded research, and reference sections of relevant articles. Studies that (a) evaluated a CIH approach to promote chronic pain management among military personnel, (b) used a randomized controlled trial design, and (c) assessed pain intensity were included. Two coders extracted data from each study and calculated effect sizes. Discrepancies between coders were resolved through discussion. Comprehensive searches identified 12 studies (k = 15 interventions) that met inclusion criteria. CIH practices included cognitive- behavioral therapies (k = 5), positive psychology (k = 3), yoga (k = 2), acupuncture (k = 2), mindfulness-based interventions (k = 2), and biofeedback (k = 1). Across these studies, participants who received the intervention reported greater reductions in pain intensity (d+ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.21, 0.67], k = 15) compared to controls. Statistically significant improvements were also observed for physical functioning (d+ = 0.36, 95% CI [0.11, 0.61], k = 11) but not for depressive symptoms (d== 0.21, 95% CI [=0.15, 0.57], k = 8). CIH approaches reduced pain intensity and improved physical functioning. These approaches offer a nonpharmacological, nonsurgical intervention for chronic pain management for military personnel. Future studies should optimize interventions to improve depressive symptoms in military populations experiencing chronic pain.

TI  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for people with advanced progressive illness, their caregivers and staff involved in their care: A scoping review
T2  - PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: People with an advanced progressive illness and their caregivers frequently experience anxiety, uncertainty and anticipatory grief. Traditional approaches to address psychological concerns aim to modify dysfunctional thinking; however, this is limited in palliative care, as often concerns area valid and thought modification is unrealistic. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a mindfulness-based behavioural therapy aimed at promoting acceptance and valued living even in difficult circumstances. Evidence on its value in palliative care is emerging. Aims: To scope the evidence regarding Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for people with advanced progressive illness, their caregivers and staff involved in their care. Design: Systematic scoping review using four databases (Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL and AMED), with relevant MeSH terms and keywords from January 1999 to May 2023. Results: 1,373 papers were identified and 26 were eligible for inclusion. These involved people with advanced progressive illness (n = 14), informal caregivers (n = 4), palliative care staff (n = 3), bereaved carers (n = 3), and mixed groups (n = 2). Intervention studies (n = 15) showed that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable and may have positive effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and sleep in palliative care populations. Observational studies (n = 11) revealed positive relationships between acceptance and adjustment to loss and physical function. Conclusion: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable and feasible in palliative care, and may improve anxiety, depression, and distress. Full scale mixed-method evaluation studies are now needed to demonstrate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness amongst patients; while further intervention development and feasibility studies are warranted to explore its value for bereaved carers and staff.

TI  - Looking Inside the Black Box of Mindfulness Meditation: Investigating Attention and Awareness During Meditation Using the Mindful Awareness Task (MAT)
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Training attention and awareness in mindfulness meditation is theorized to be essential for the cultivation of mindfulness and its salutary outcomes. Yet, the empirical foundation for this central premise in mindfulness science is surprisingly small due to a limited methodological capacity to measure attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation. Accordingly, we set out to measure and study these processes in a laboratory study (N = 143, 76.92% female) using a novel behavioral measurement paradigm-the mindful awareness task (MAT). We empirically characterized attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation and found novel behavioral evidence indicating that, as long-theorized, these processes were related to previous mindfulness meditation practice, attitudinal qualities of mindfulness, attention regulation, and mental health. Furthermore, we found that the accuracy of self-reported mindfulness was, paradoxically, dependent on behavioral capacities for mindful awareness; and that sustained visual attention and executive functions, measured via cognitive-experimental tasks, were not meaningfully related to attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation. In contrast, the MAT demonstrated sound psychometric performance as a measure of mindful awareness, and may overcome significant limitations of extant mindfulness measurement methods. Collectively, findings challenge conceptual and methodological assumptions in mindfulness science, provide a novel paradigmatic direction for research on mindfulness, and present long-awaited evidence that attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation may indeed be fundamental to its practice, cultivation, and salutary functions.

TI  - The Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Fidelity Measure (MORE-FM): Development and Validation of a New Tool to Assess Therapist Adherence and Competence
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) is a mind-body therapy that unites complementary aspects of mindfulness training, third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and principles from positive psychology into an integrative treatment for addiction and its comorbidities. As interest in MORE has grown among researchers and clinicians, there is an increasing need to provide quality assurance measures to ensure treatment integrity during implementation of MORE. Here, we describe the development and validation of the Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Fidelity Measure (MORE-FM).Method: We developed a 17-item scale assessing therapist competence and adherence to the MORE treatment manual, which was then used for fidelity monitoring of 40 MORE treatment sessions across two Stage 2 and two Stage 1 RCT for addictive behaviors (e.g., opioid misuse, obesity) involving a total N = 295.Results: Internal consistency for the Adherence (alpha =.89) and Competence subscales (alpha =.92) was high, and interrater reliability was adequate (Adherence subscale ICC =.77; Competence subscale ICC =.51), with therapists exhibiting good-to-excellent levels of fidelity across all trials. Importantly, linear mixed modeling indicated that higher levels of overall fidelity were associated with greater reductions in opioid misuse across two Stage 2 RCTs (F-1,F-48.00 = 7.38, p=.009), indicating that the MORE-FM is a valid measure of treatment fidelity that can predict clinical outcomes.Conclusions: Findings from this study yielded insights for future iterations of the MORE-FM. In sum, the MORE-FM is a valuable tool for assessing and enhancing the integrity of MORE in future research trials and clinical applications.

TI  - Effects of a brief mindfulness-meditation intervention on neural measures of response inhibition in cigarette smokers
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Research suggests that mindfulness-practices may aid smoking cessation. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness-practices on smoking are unclear. Response inhibition is a main deficit in addiction, is associated with relapse, and could therefore be a candidate target for mindfulness-based practices. The current study hence investigated the effects of a brief mindfulness-practice on response inhibition in smokers using behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures. Fifty participants (33 females, mean age 20 years old) underwent a protocol of cigarette exposure to induce craving (cueexposure) and were then randomly assigned to a group receiving mindfulness-instructions or control-instructions (for 15 minutes approximately). Immediately after this, they performed a smoking Go/ NoGo task, while their brain activity was recorded. At the behavioral level, no group differences were observed. However, EEG analyses revealed a decrease in P3 amplitude during NoGo vs. Go trials in the mindfulness versus control group. The lower P3 amplitude might indicate less-effortful response inhibition after the mindfulness-practice, and suggest that enhanced response inhibition underlies observed positive effects of mindfulness on smoking behavior.

T2  - MENTAL HEALTH RELIGION & CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ten perfections (known as inner strengths) are considered positive psychological characteristics, namely, generosity, morality, mindfulness/meditation, wisdom, perseverance, patience and endurance, truthfulness, determination, loving kindness and equanimity. The goal of this study was to develop a new instrument, the (inner) Strength-Based Inventory (SBI) based on these ten perfections. In all, 947 participants completed the SBI for item evaluation using Rasch analysis, and 556 completed the original version of the SBI comprising 10 items with five to eight response choices. The final version comprising 10 items, with five choices for each item, which were completed by 391 participants for the second evaluation. All 10 items showed a unidimensional construct with good fit statistics, good reliability and targeting. The SBI provided sufficient validity and reliability based on the Rasch measurement model. It may facilitate counselling and psychotherapy by enabling clinicians to use it as an individual's positive resource. Further investigation among diverse cultures is encouraged.

TI  - Mindful Age and Technology: a Qualitative Analysis of a Tablet/Smartphone App Intervention Designed for Older Adults
T2  - INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global population is aging while modern healthcare systems are responding with limited success to the growing care demands of the senior population. Capitalizing on recent technological advancements, new ways to improve older adults' quality of life have recently been implemented. The current study investigated, from a qualitative point of view, the utility of a mindfulness-based smartphone application for older adults. A description of the older adults' experience with the smartphone application designed to enhance well-being and mindfulness will be presented. Participants'general beliefs about the benefits of technology for personal well-being will also be discussed. 68 older adults were recruited from different education centers for seniors. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: a) a treatment group, which received the smartphone application intervention (n = 34), or b) a waitlist control group (n = 34). The experimental intervention included the utilization of a smartphone app designed specifically for improving older adult well-being and mindfulness levels. Participants completed semi-structured interviews evaluating participants' treatment experience and technology-acceptance at recruitment (T0, baseline) and post-intervention (T1, post-intervention). Through thematic analysis, four themes were identified from verbatim responses of both interviews: Utility of technology for health, Impressions of technology, Mindful-benefits of smartphone application usage, and Smartphone application usage as a means to improve interpersonal relationships. Participants showed a positive experience of the app intervention. Qualitative analysis underlined the main Mindfulness-benefits reported by participants and the potentially crucial role of "Langerian" mindfulness in the relationship between older adults and health technology.

AB  - Many recent behavioral and neuroscientific studies have revealed the importance of investigating meditation states and traits to achieve an increased understanding of cognitive and affective neuroplasticity, attention and self-awareness, as well as for their increasingly recognized clinical relevance. The investigation of states and traits related to meditation has especially pronounced implications for the neuroscience of attention, consciousness, self-awareness, empathy and theory of mind. In this article we present the main features of meditation-based mental training and characterize the current scientific approach to meditation states and traits with special reference to attention and consciousness, in light of the articles contributed to this issue.

TI  - Relationships Between Applied Mindfulness Practice, Chronic Pain, and Pain-Related Functioning in Veterans.
T2  - The journal of pain
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to improve chronic pain and associated conditions like depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. However, there is limited research on how veterans with chronic pain apply mindfulness skills to manage pain in daily life. This cross-sectional study examined the association between applied mindfulness practice, pain, and several pain-related conditions among 1,737 veterans with chronic pain prior to enrollment in a trial of 2 MBIs. Applied mindfulness practice was assessed using the Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS). Theoutcomes included pain interference, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, physical function, and social participation. Higher overall AMPS scores, as well as the positive and negative emotional regulation subscales of the AMPS, were associated with less pain interference and catastrophizing, as well as better outcomes for all pain-related conditions. The positive emotional regulation subscale had the strongest associations with outcomes. There was no significant association between the AMPS and pain intensity. Theresults suggest applied mindfulness practice, especially positive emotional regulation, may improve pain and functioning. In addition, the AMPS shows promise as a process measure of mindfulness skills applied in daily life. Additional research is needed to examine different aspects of mindfulness in the context of MBIs. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes the relationship between applied mindfulness practice and pain-related outcomes, prior to a MBI, using a novel measure of mindfulness practice. These findings underscore the importance of measuring applied mindfulness practice prior to and during clinical interventions to treat chronic pain.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Neff's (2003a, 2003b) notion of self-compassion emphasizes kindness towards one's self, a feeling of connectedness with others, and mindful awareness of distressing experiences. Because exposure to trauma and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) may be associated with self-criticism and avoidance of internal experiences, the authors examined the relationship between self-compassion and PSS. Out of a sample of 210 university students, 100 endorsed experiencing a Criterion A trauma. Avoidance symptoms significantly correlated with self-compassion, but reexperiencing and hyperarousal did not. Individuals high in self-compassion may engage in less avoidance strategies following trauma exposure, allowing for a natural exposure process.

TI  - Mindfulness meditation training effects on CD4+T lymphocytes in HIV-1 infected adults: A small randomized controlled trial
T2  - BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness meditation training has stress reduction benefits in various patient populations, but its effects on biological markers of HIV-1 progression are unknown. The present study tested the efficacy of an 8-week Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) meditation program compared to a 1-day control seminar on CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in stressed HIV infected adults. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with enrollment and follow-up occurring between November 2005 and December 2007. A diverse community sample of 48 HIV-1 infected adults was randomized and entered treatment in either an 8-week MBSR or a 1-day control stress reduction education seminar. The primary outcome was circulating counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Participants in the 1-day control seminar showed declines in CD4+ T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among participants in the 8-week MBSR program were unchanged from baseline to post-intervention (time x treatment condition interaction, p=.02). This effect was independent of antiretroviral (ARV) medication use. Additional analyses indicated that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness meditation training on buffering CD4+ T lymphocyte declines. These findings provide an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training can buffer CD4+ T lymphocyte declines in HIV-1 infected adults.

TI  - Trait mindfulness and the mental and physical health of caregivers for individuals with cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Mindfulness plays a role in one's mental and physical health outcomes. The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between trait mindfulness and the (1) psychological functioning, (2) health behaviors, (3) and physical health of caregivers for individuals diagnosed with cancer. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted with family caregivers of individuals diagnosed with cancer . Caregivers were recruited for the study during oncology appointments with their loved ones at twelve academic and community oncology centers located in western Pennsylvania. Caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires and examinations assessing sociodemographic characteristics, trait mindfulness, depression, perceived stress, caregiver stress, sleep, diet, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use, blood pressure, and BMI. Demographic and cancer-related information was collected from the individuals whom caregivers supported and the medical chart. Linear, logistic, and ordinal regression were performed.Results: Of the 77 caregivers, the mean age was 64 (S.D.= 10.7); 60% identified as female; 97% identified as White; the response rate was 72.6%. Regression analyses indicated that caregivers who reported higher levels of trait mindfulness reported significantly lower levels of depression ( 3=-0.35, SE = 1.13, 95% CI =-5.95,-1.43, p = .002), better caregiver quality of life ( 3=-0.422, SE = 2.17, 95% CI =-13.03,-4.38, p < .001), lower levels of perceived stress ( 3=-.517, SE = 0.90, 95% CI =-6.06,-2.47, p < .001), better sleep quality ( 3=-0.23, SE = 0.44, 95% CI =-1.78,-0.2, p = 0.05), lower rates of tobacco use (OR = 7.15; 95% CI = 1.36, 37.47, p = .007), and greater levels of physical activity ( X 2 = 20.60, p < .001). Trait mindfulness was not significantly related to diet, alcohol use, blood pressure, or BMI.Conclusions: Findings indicated that higher levels of trait mindfulness are associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes for caregivers. Future research would benefit from further examining mindfulness-based interventions and their impacts in mitigating the negative toll of caregiving in the context of cancer.

TI  - Interventions that target improvements in mental health for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders: A narrative review
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) suggest that one in 68 children is affected. With convincing evidence that parenting a child with ASD is associated with elevated distress and mental health problems, researchers have begun to investigate treatments that directly target parents' psychological well-being. We conducted a narrative review of studies that empirically tested the effects of interventions targeting improvements in the mental health of parents of children with ASD. Following a range of search strategies, a total of 13 studies, seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six pre-post test designs, met inclusion criteria. We calculated and reported effect sizes for all RCTs. On average, treatment produced medium to large effect sizes with improvements in parenting stress and general health, and reductions in depression and anxiety. Interventions that appeared promising included: Stress Management and Relaxation Techniques, Expressive Writing, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. However, only one study conducted a follow-up assessment >3 months post intervention. Study populations primarily consisted of English-speaking mothers, ages 39 to 42 years. Conclusions were limited by small sample sizes, homogeneity of sample population, and reliance on self-report Therefore, this body of research contains significant limitations in need of improvement for this field to move forward and benefit a sizable number of parents.

TI  - Appreciative Joy Meditation Enhances Acceptance of Unfair Offer in Ultimatum Game
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesEmpirical studies have shown that the Four Immeasurables Meditations (FIM) can enhance compassionate decisions towards others, such as helping victims being treated unfairly in economic games. However, research investigating how FIM affects individuals' decisions when they themselves are victims is sparse. Thus, the current study utilized a randomized trial to scrutinize the causal influence of practicing FIM on people's reactions towards unfairness that is directed at them.MethodsMeditation novices (N=135) were randomly assigned to practice either a brief Appreciative Joy Meditation (AJM) or a matched neutral visualization. They then took part in the Ultimatum Game where they first acted as a proposer to propose an offer to another person, then acted as a responder to decide whether to accept a set of offers.ResultsThe AJM group accepted significantly more unfair offers, but neither proposed a higher offer to others nor changed the perception of fairness, as compared with the neutral visualization control group. Furthermore, self-reported emotional changes during meditation practice could not predict behavior in the Ultimatum Game, but the Self-Transcendence dimension of the Appreciative Joy Scale, which reflects one's ability to feel happy for others when one is in an inferior situation, predicted higher acceptance rate of unfair offers.ConclusionsThis study provided a piece of causal evidence that a brief practice of AJM can make people more tolerable to unfairness directed against them. Broadly, this study also inspired more investigations on attitudes towards people in superior situations in future studies on FIM.

TI  - Loving-kindness and walking meditation with a robot: Countering negative mood by stimulating creativity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Young adults undergoing psychological changes are particularly vulnerable. Recent social isolation impedes interpersonal help while stress from family, school, work, and society has brought negative effects on mental health, even in otherwise healthy young adults. Recent research has shown that daily creativity contributes to well-being. To circumvent issues of contamination, we tried a NAO robot guiding a Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM) and Walking Meditation (WM). By improving mental states (i.e. positive valence and state openness), we stimulated creative behavior to reduce negative mood. Participants (N = 142) were healthy individuals, aged between 18 and 34, joining a one-time laboratory experiment. They responded to two rounds of questionnaires, with a 10 min intervention guided by audio or a NAO robot in between each round. A control group with participants with no treatment (i.e. taking a 10 min rest) was added for comparison. Both audio-guided LKM and WM successfully evoked state openness, with the former also exerting a positive effect on valence. Valence and state openness were positively correlated, and both were associated with a higher willingness to create. With positive valence, young adults likely perform better on convergent thinking. The result may potentially lead to negative mood reduction. The discussion emphasizes the importance of designing specific characteristics of social robots in accordance with the task's context.

TI  - Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (PREVENT): a randomised controlled trial
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Individuals with a history of recurrent depression have a high risk of repeated depressive relapse or recurrence. Maintenance antidepressants for at least 2 years is the current recommended treatment, but many individuals are interested in alternatives to medication. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk of relapse or recurrence compared with usual care, but has not yet been compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in a definitive trial. We aimed to see whether MBCT with support to taper or discontinue antidepressant treatment (MBCT-TS) was superior to maintenance antidepressants for prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence over 24 months.Methods In this single-blind, parallel, group randomised controlled trial (PREVENT), we recruited adult patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes and on a therapeutic dose of maintenance antidepressants, from primary care general practices in urban and rural settings in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT-TS or maintenance antidepressants (in a 1:1 ratio) with a computer-generated random number sequence with stratification by centre and symptomatic status. Participants were aware of treatment allocation and research assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was time to relapse or recurrence of depression, with patients followed up at five separate intervals during the 24-month study period. The primary analysis was based on the principle of intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN26666654.Findings Between March 23, 2010, and Oct 21, 2011, we assessed 2188 participants for eligibility and recruited 424 patients from 95 general practices. 212 patients were randomly assigned to MBCT-TS and 212 to maintenance antidepressants. The time to relapse or recurrence of depression did not differ between MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants over 24 months (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.67-1.18; p=0.43), nor did the number of serious adverse events. Five adverse events were reported, including two deaths, in each of the MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants groups. No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial.Interpretation We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals at risk for depressive relapse or recurrence. Both treatments were associated with enduring positive outcomes in terms of relapse or recurrence, residual depressive symptoms, and quality of life.

TI  - Functional neuroanatomy of meditation: A review and meta-analysis of 78 functional neuroimaging investigations
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Meditation is a family of mental practices that encompasses a wide array of techniques employing distinctive mental strategies. We systematically reviewed 78 functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) studies of meditation, and used activation likelihood estimation to meta-analyze 257 peak foci from 31 experiments involving 527 participants. We found reliably dissociable patterns of brain activation and deactivation for four common styles of meditation (focused attention, mantra recitation, open monitoring, and compassion/loving-kindness), and suggestive differences for three others (visualization, sense-withdrawal, and non-dual awareness practices). Overall, dissociable activation patterns are congruent with the psychological and behavioral aims of each practice. Some brain areas are recruited consistently across multiple techniques including insula, pre/supplementary motor cortices, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex but convergence is the exception rather than the rule. A preliminary effect-size meta-analysis found medium effects for both activations (d = 0.59) and deactivations (d = -0.74), suggesting potential practical significance. Our meta-analysis supports the neurophysiological dissociability of meditation practices, but also raises many methodological concerns and suggests avenues for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Zen Practice: A Training Method to Enhance the Skills of Clinical Social Workers
T2  - SOCIAL WORK IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Zen Buddhist meditation in clinical practice has received specific attention from mental health disciplines in the West. A study was undertaken to examine the influence of a personal practice of Zen on the professional work of clinical social workers, Ten experienced clinical social workers who were long-term Zen practitioners were interviewed. Findings from this qualitative study suggest that Zen meditation has direct application to clinical social work in three areas: (1) cultivating Awareness, (2) enhancing Acceptance, and (3) nurturing Responsibility. This article reports on the findings in the area of Awareness, Awareness increases a social worker's focus on the present moment with the client, providing for a suspension of preconceived ideas about the client. Building on the view that social work is both art and science, the author proposes the use of Zen in the training of clinical social workers.

TI  - Effects of Breathing Meditation Training on Sustained Attention Level, Mindfulness Attention Awareness Level, and Mental State of Operating Room Nurses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: In this paper, we explore the effects of breathing meditation training on the sustained attention level, mindfulness attention awareness level, and mental state of nurses in the operating room. Methods: We enrolled 40 nurses from September 2019 to December 2019, and divided them into a control group (N=20) and an observation group (N=20) using a random number table. The control group received routine training, based on which the observation group received breathing meditation training. We compared their sustained attention index, fatigue score, mindfulness attention awareness score, mental state score, work stress score, career satisfaction score, and career happiness index. Results: After training, the sustained attention response time was shorter at 8:00 and 18:00 in the observation group than in the control group (p < .05). The physical fatigue score, mental fatigue score, reduced activity score, reduced motivation score, and overall fatigue score of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (p < .05). The observation group had a higher mindfulness attention awareness score than did the control group (p < .05). The SAS and SDS scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (p < .05). The work stress score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group, whereas the career satisfaction score and career happiness index were higher (p < .05). Conclusion: Breathing meditation training can improve the sustained attention level and mindfulness attention awareness level, reduce the feeling of fatigue and work stress, help adjust the mental state, and enhance the career satisfaction and career happiness of nurses in the operating room.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness Training on Body Awareness to Sexual Stimuli: Implications for Female Sexual Dysfunction
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Treatments of female sexual dysfunction have been largely unsuccessful because they do not address the psychological factors that underlie female sexuality. Negative self-evaluative processes interfere with the ability to attend and register physiological changes (interoceptive awareness). This study explores the effect of mindfulness meditation training on interoceptive awareness and the three categories of known barriers to healthy sexual functioning: attention, self-judgment, and clinical symptoms. Methods: Forty-four college students (30 women) participated in either a 12-week course containing a "meditation laboratory'' or an active control course with similar content or laboratory format. Interoceptive awareness was measured by reaction time in rating physiological response to sexual stimuli. Psychological barriers were assessed with self-reported measures of mindfulness and psychological wellbeing. Results: Women who participated in the meditation training became significantly faster at registering their physiological responses (interoceptive awareness) to sexual stimuli compared with active controls (F(1,28) = 5.45, p = .03, eta(2)(p) = 0.15). Female meditators also improved their scores on attention (t = 4.42, df = 11, p = .001), self-judgment, (t = 3.1, df = 11, p = .01), and symptoms of anxiety (t = -3.17, df = 11, p = .009) and depression (t = -2.13, df = 11, p < .05). Improvements in interoceptive awareness were correlated with improvements in the psychological barriers to healthy sexual functioning (r = -0.44 for attention, r = -0.42 for self-judgment, and r = 0.49 for anxiety; all p < .05). Conclusions: Mindfulness-based improvements in interoceptive awareness highlight the potential of mindfulness training as a treatment of female sexual dysfunction.

TI  - Investigating differential effects of socio-emotional and mindfulness-based online interventions on mental health, resilience and social capacities during the COVID-19 pandemic: The study protocol
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a mental health crisis on a global scale. Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21.MethodsWe will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including 'Affect Dyad') and a mindfulness-based (including 'Breathing Meditation') intervention, delivered through a weband cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample (N = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva.DiscussionResults will reveal the differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of global stressors.

TI  - Common variant in <i>OXTR</i> predicts growth in positive emotions from loving-kindness training
T2  - PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ample research suggests that social connection reliably generates positive emotions. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide implicated in social cognition and behavior, is one biological mechanism that may influence an individual's capacity to extract positive emotions from social contexts. Because variation in certain genes may indicate underlying neurobiological differences, we tested whether several SNPs in two genes related to oxytocin signaling would show effects on positive emotions that were context-specific, depending on sociality. For six weeks, a sample of mid-life adults (N = 122) participated in either socially-focused loving kindness training or mindfulness training. During this timespan they reported their positive emotions daily. Five SNPs within OXTR and CD38 were assayed, and each was tested for its individual effect on daily emotions. The hypothesized three-way interaction between time, training type, and genetic variability emerged: Individuals homozygous for the G allele of OXTR rs1042778 experienced gains in daily positive emotions from loving-kindness training, whereas individuals with the T allele did not experience gains in positive emotions with either training. These findings are among the first to show how genetic differences in oxytocin signaling may influence an individual's capacity to experience positive emotions as a result of a socially-focused intervention.

TI  - Enhancing Clinicians' Well-Being and Patient-Centered Care Through Mindfulness
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:Mindful clinicians are resilient and more likely to provide patient-centered care. We aimed to enhance clinicians' well-being by offering a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course that teaches mindfulness and stress management and then determine whether this impacted their subsequent medical encounters.Methods:In a longitudinal cohort study with 27 clinicians, MBSR was taught by a certified instructor. Pre-MBSR and post-MBSR online questionnaires assessed burnout, depression, stress, meaningfulness, and mindfulness. Patients independently rated their clinicians using the Rochester Communication Rating Scale (RCRS) after a clinical encounter before and after their clinician took the MBSR course. Nine medical doctors audiorecorded the consultations before and after MBSR; the tapes were coded and analyzed by an independent team using the Roter interaction analyses system.Results:Significant reductions in stress and burnout were found, and increases in mindfulness and meaningfulness. The decrease in stress was correlated with less judgmental attitudes and less reactivityfacets of mindfulness. The decrease in emotional exhaustion was correlated with more acting with awareness and less judgmental attitudesfacets of mindfulness. Patients' perceptions of the clinical encounter suggested that patient-centered care improved after MBSR. Decreased depersonalization was significantly associated with the RCRS subscale, understanding of the patient's experience of illness. At both time points, doctors dominated the exchange and were patient-centered.Discussion:Mindfulness has a direct and positive impact on clinicians' well-being. When clinicians' experienced less depersonalization, their patients reported being better understood.

TI  - Imaging-Guided Core-Needle Breast Biopsy: Impact of Meditation and Music Interventions on Patient Anxiety, Pain, and Fatigue
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of guided meditation and music interventions on patient anxiety, pain, and fatigue during imaging-guided breast biopsy.Methods: After giving informed consent, 121 women needing percutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy were randomized into three groups: (1) guided meditation; (2) music; (3) standard-care control group. During biopsy, the meditation and music groups listened to an audio-recorded, guided, loving-kindness meditation and relaxing music, respectively; the standard-care control group received supportive dialogue from the biopsy team. Immediately before and after biopsy, participants completed questionnaires measuring anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale), biopsy pain (Brief Pain Inventory), and fatigue (modified Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue). After biopsy, participants completed questionnaires assessing radiologist-patient communication (modified, Questionnaire on the Quality of Physician-Patient Interaction), demographics, and medical history.Results: The meditation and music groups reported significantly greater anxiety reduction (P values <.05) and reduced fatigue after biopsy than the standard-care control group; the standard-care control group reported increased fatigue after biopsy. The meditation group additionally showed significantly lower pain during biopsy, compared with the music group (P =.03). No significant difference in patient-perceived quality of radiologist-patient communication was noted among groups.Conclusions: Listening to guided meditation significantly lowered biopsy pain during imaging-guided breast biopsy; meditation and music reduced patient anxiety and fatigue without compromising radiologist-patient communication. These simple, inexpensive interventions could improve women's experiences during core-needle breast biopsy.

T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS)
CL  - FL
AB  - Post-traumatic stress and other problems often occur after combat, deployment, and other military operations. Because techniques such as mindfulness meditation show efficacy in improving mental health, our team developed a mobile application (app) for individuals in the armed forces with subclinical psychological problems as secondary prevention of more significant disease. Based on the Personal Health Intervention Toolkit (PHIT), a mobile app framework for personalized health intervention studies, PHIT for Duty integrates mindfulness-based relaxation, behavioral education in sleep quality and alcohol use, and psychometric and psychophysiological data capture. We evaluated PHIT for Duty in usability and health assessment studies to establish app quality for use in health research. Participants (N = 31) rated usability on a 1 (very hard) to 5 (very easy) scale and also completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire (N = 9). Results were (mean +/- SD) overall (4.5 +/- 0.6), self-report instruments (4.5 +/- 0.7), pulse sensor (3.7 +/- 1.2), sleep monitor (4.4 +/- 0.7), sleep monitor comfort (3.7 +/- 1.1), and wrist actigraphy comfort (2.7 +/- 0.9). The average SUS score was 85 +/- 12, indicating a rank of 95%. A comparison of PHIT-based assessments to traditional paper forms demonstrated a high overall correlation (r = 0.87). These evaluations of usability, health assessment accuracy, physiological sensing, system acceptability, and overall functionality have shown positive results and affirmation for using the PHIT framework and PHIT for Duty application in mobile health research.

TI  - Smokers Show Lower Levels of Psychological Well-Being and Mindfulness than Non-Smokers
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness is defined as "paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally". Mindfulness is associated with positive affect, life satisfaction, self-esteem, lower negative affect and rumination. Conversely, evidence suggests a relationship between nicotine dependence and psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to compare the levels of Mindfulness and Subjective Well-Being (SWB) between smokers and non-smokers. Ninety seven smokers and eighty four non-smokers participated in the study (n = 181). The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-BR) and the Subjective Well-Being Scale (SWBS) were used. In all the factors of SWBS, the total scores in the FFMQ-BR and in the facets of Observing and Non-Reactivity, the non-smokers scored higher than the smokers. This study suggests that smokers present lower levels of Mindfulness and SWB than non-smokers. Consequently, we propose that Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) may help smokers deal with treatment and abstinence by increasing their level of SWB.

TI  - Meditation training and enduring changes in psychological functioning: a 7-year longitudinal study
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Considerable research has now documented the beneficial effects of mindfulness-based practices on psychological functioning. Less is known about the long-term durability of such changes following formal meditation training. In a sample of adults (N = 67, 52% female, ages 22-70 years), we examined changes in 16 measures of psychological adaptive functioning across a 3-month residential meditation intervention and across a subsequent 7-year period. We observed general training-related improvements followed by multi-year returns toward pre-training levels. However, beneficial changes in two personality attributes (agreeableness and neuroticism) were of moderate effect size (d = 0.51 and d = 0.45, respectively) and were retained across the 7-year follow-up. We further found that individual variation in changes was represented by three latent attributes: (Changes related to) Mindful Well-being, Resilient Extraversion, and Self-Compassionate Openness. These results suggest that intensive meditation training is associated with improved adaptive functioning and enduring changes in aspects of personality.

TI  - Spiritual and religious interventions as a complementary and supportive therapy in women with breast cancer: an integrative literature review
T2  - KONTAKT-JOURNAL OF NURSING AND SOCIAL SCIENCES RELATED TO HEALTH AND ILLNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Effective coping mechanisms and available support systems are essential to managing the disease and maintaining the mental health of women with breast cancer. It has been found that spirituality and religion can be an important supportive element in coping with cancer and its consequences. Aim: To analyse spiritual and religious (s/r) interventions provided by health care professionals to breast cancer patients, and their relationship to physical health, psychosocial, and spiritual outcomes. Methods: Integrative literature review of systematic literature reviews and/or meta -analysis was chosen. PubMed and Web of Science databases for the period 2013-2023 after entering the keywords "spiritual, religious, existential, positive psychology, mindfulness, interventions, breast cancer, cancer" in English were searched. Results: The review included 13 systematic reviews and/or meta -analyses (SRMA). Effect of mindfulness intervention was most frequently analysed. S/r interventions significantly associated with improvements in spiritual and existential well-being, quality of life and personal well-being, hope, optimism, cognitive functions and reductions of anxiety, depression, hopelessness, stress, and fatigue. Two SRMA found that s/r interventions were associated with improvements in cortisol levels, inflammatory cytokine activity, and lymphocyte function. Conclusion: The analysed studies showed that s/r interventions are associated with improved biological, psychosocial and spiritual outcomes, which supports the application of these interventions in clinical practice.

TI  - Effects of meditation on frontal α-asymmetry in previously suicidal individuals
T2  - NEUROREPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the effects of a meditation-based treatment for preventing relapse to depression, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), on prefrontal alpha-asymmetry in resting electroencephalogram (EEG), a biological indicator of affective style. Twenty-two individuals with a previous history of suicidal depression were randomly assigned to either MBCT (N=10) or treatment-as-usual (TAU, N=12). Resting electroencephalogram was measured before and after an 8-week course of treatment. The TAU group showed a significant deterioration toward decreased relative left-frontal activation, indexing decreases in positive affective style, while there was no significant change in the MBCT group. The findings suggest that MBCT can help individuals at high risk for suicidal depression to retain a balanced pattern of baseline emotion-related brain activation.

TI  - Mindfulness Training for Emotion Dysregulation in Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) report greater emotion dysregulation, which is associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Given the transdiagnostic significance of emotion dysregulation, the current study was designed to assess the feasibility and treatment effects of mindfulness meditation in reducing emotion dysregulation for PwMS. Method: Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 4-week mindfulness-based training (MBT), 4-week adaptive cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist control group. Using self-report and behavioral measures, we examined the effects of MBT on emotion dysregulation, use of emotion regulation strategies. experience of negative and positive affect, and overall quality of life. Results: Mindfulness training was associated with reduced emotion dysregulation compared with the adaptive cognitive training and the waitlist control group (eta(2)(p) = .20). Relative to the waitlist group, the MBT group also demonstrated reductions on a composite score of preservative cognition, measuring rumination and worry (eta(2 )(p)= .15). However, there was no differential use of emotion regulation strategies or between-groups differences in overall quality of life as a function of training. Conclusions: Our pilot study provides preliminary support for MBT to reduce self-reported emotion dysregulation in PwMS. Given the widespread prevalence of mental health disturbances in this population, MBT can serve as a promising rehabilitation tool for PwMS (clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02717429).

TI  - Is There a Biofeedback Response to Art Therapy? A Technology-Assisted Approach for Reducing Anxiety and Stress in College Students
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - College students are exposed to daily stressors throughout their academic careers, which can have lasting consequences to their health and well-being. Mindfulness practices, art therapy, and the simple act of manipulating clay have independently demonstrated positive effects on stress and anxiety, but there is little research on the feasibility of incorporating these into an online resource for students to proactively address their mental health. In this pilot study, full-time university students (N = 15) were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) program that used clay for all art directives or an unstructured, undirected neutral clay-manipulating task (NCT) for 10 weeks. Anxiety symptoms, salivary cortisol concentrations, and perceived levels of stress were assessed. Within-group analysis demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety symptoms and cortisol concentrations for MBAT participants, with no significant decrease in perceived stress. NCT participants experienced a significant decrease in cortisol concentrations on Week 1 but not on Week 10, with no other statistical significance in outcomes detected. Between-group analysis generated no significant interactions between variables. Based on these results, the structure of a therapist-directed online MBAT program using clay has the capacity to elicit anxiety-reducing benefits and may produce a trained biofeedback response for combating stress, offering a feasible strategy for addressing the mental health crisis on college campuses.

TI  - SlowMo therapy, a new digital blended therapy for fear of harm from others: An account of therapy personalisation within a targeted intervention
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives SlowMo therapy is a pioneering blended digital therapy for paranoia, augmenting face-to-face therapy with an interactive 'webapp' and a mobile app. A recent large-scale trial demonstrated small-moderate effects on paranoia alongside improvements in self-esteem, worry, well-being and quality of life. This paper provides a comprehensive account of therapy personalisation within this targeted approach. Design Case examples illustrate therapy delivery and descriptive data are presented on personalised thought content. Method Thought content was extracted from the webapp (n = 140 participants) and coded using newly devised categories: Worries: (1) Persecutory, (2) Negative social evaluation, (3) Negative self-concept, (4) Loss/life stresses, (5) Sensory-perceptual experiences and (6) Health anxieties. Safer thoughts: (1) Safer alternative (specific alternatives to worries), (2) Second-wave (generalised) coping, (3) Positive self-concept, (4) Positive activities and (5) Third-wave (mindfulness-based) coping. Data on therapy fidelity are also presented. Results Worries: 'Persecutory' (92.9% of people) and 'Negative social evaluation' (74.3%) were most common. 'General worries/ life stresses' (31.4%) and 'Negative self-concept' (22.1%) were present in a significant minority; 'Health anxieties' (10%) and 'Sensory-perceptual' (10%) were less common. Safer thoughts: 'Second-wave (general) coping' (85%), 'Safer alternatives' (76.4%), 'Positive self-concept' (65.7%) and 'Positive activities' (64.3%) were common with 'Third-wave' (mindfulness) coping observed for 30%. Fidelity: Only three therapy withdrawals were therapy related. Session adherence was excellent (mean = 15.2/16; SD = 0.9). Behavioural work was conducted with 71% of people (119/168). Conclusion SlowMo therapy delivers a targeted yet personalised approach. Potential mechanisms of action extend beyond reasoning. Implications for cognitive models of paranoia and causal interventionist approaches are discussed.

TI  - Meditation-induced neuroplastic changes in amygdala activity during negative affective processing
T2  - SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that the effects of meditation practice on affective processing and resilience have the potential to induce neuroplastic changes within the amygdala. Notably, literature speculates that meditation training may reduce amygdala activity during negative affective processing. Nonetheless, studies have thus far not verified this speculation. In this longitudinal study, participants (N=21, 9 men) were trained in awareness-based compassion meditation (ABCM) or matched relaxation training. The effects of meditation training on amygdala activity were examined during passive viewing of affective and neutral stimuli in a non-meditative state. We found that the ABCM group exhibited significantly reduced anxiety and right amygdala activity during negative emotion processing than the relaxation group. Furthermore, ABCM participants who performed more compassion practice had stronger right amygdala activity reduction during negative emotion processing. The lower right amygdala activity after ABCM training may be associated with a general reduction in reactivity and distress. As all participants performed the emotion processing task in a non-meditative state, it appears likely that the changes in right amygdala activity are carried over from the meditation practice into the non-meditative state. These findings suggest that the distress-reducing effects of meditation practice on affective processing may transfer to ordinary states, which have important implications on stress management.

TI  - The effectiveness of mindfulness training in improving medical students' stress, depression, and anxiety
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThere is growing interest in Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program to combat mental distress in medical students. In Saudi Arabia, literature is insufficient about MBSR and its effectiveness. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of MBSR in improving mindful state, stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students. Also, the study explores the association between the attendance rate of MBSR sessions and its effectiveness. Lastly, the study examines gender differences in response to MBSR.MethodsThis is a stratified randomized controlled study of 84 medical students from two medical schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They were recruited voluntarily from November 2018 to April 2021, and allocated to MBSR and waitlist groups using a stratified randomization method based on gender. MBSR group received eight weeks of sessions through audiovisual materials. An online survey utilizing validated questionnaires assessing stress, mindfulness, anxiety, and depression was used to evaluate both groups pre-program (time 0), post-program (time 1), and three months later (time 2).ResultsSeventy-one participants completed the post-test (time 1). There were no differences between study groups at time 0 and 1. However, in 41 subjects who completed the follow-up test (time 2), the anxiety dropped significantly in MBSR group (mean difference (MD), -3.935; 95% CI, -7.580 to -0.290). Furthermore, attending more MBSR sessions was inversely correlated with depression (r, -0.556; P, 0.002), and anxiety (r, -0.630; P, 0.000). Compared to their baseline, males in MBSR group improved in stress (MD, 3.08; 95% CI, 0.30 to 5.86), anxiety (MD, 4.91; 95% CI, 3.32 to 6.50), and mindfulness (MD, -0.58; 95% CI, -1.01 to -0.15), while females improved in stress (MD, 2.64; 95% CI, 0.02 to 5.26).ConclusionDespite the study being interrupted by the stressful COVID-19 outbreak, the findings suggest that MBSR improved psychological outcomes when participants commit to the program.

TI  - A mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students (MediMind): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Medical training is very demanding and associated with a high prevalence of psychological distress. Compared to the general population, medical students are at a greater risk of developing a psychological disorder. Various attempts of stress management training in medical school have achieved positive results on minimizing psychological distress; however, there are often limitations. Therefore, the use of a rigorous scientific method is needed. The present study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a specifically developed mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students that includes selected elements of cognitive behavioral strategies (MediMind).Methods/Design: This study protocol presents a prospective randomized controlled trial, involving four assessment time points: baseline, post-intervention, one-year follow-up and five-year follow-up. The aims include evaluating the effect on stress, coping, psychological morbidity and personality traits with validated measures. Participants are allocated randomly to one of three conditions: MediMind, Autogenic Training or control group. Eligible participants are medical or dental students in the second or eighth semester of a German university. They form a population of approximately 420 students in each academic term. A final total sample size of 126 (at five-year follow-up) is targeted. The trainings (MediMind and Autogenic Training) comprise five weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes each. MediMind will be offered to participants of the control group once the five-year follow-up is completed. The allotment is randomized with a stratified allocation ratio by course of studies, semester, and gender. After descriptive statistics have been evaluated, inferential statistical analysis will be carried out with a repeated measures ANOVA-design with interactions between time and group. Effect sizes will be calculated using partial.-square values.Discussion: Potential limitations of this study are voluntary participation and the risk of attrition, especially concerning participants that are allocated to the control group. Strengths are the study design, namely random allocation, follow-up assessment, the use of control groups and inclusion of participants at different stages of medical training with the possibility of differential analysis.

TI  - <i>Mettabhavana</i> in Traditional and Popular Buddhist Contexts
T2  - ASIAN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Some have referred to relatively recent forms of popular Buddhism as an engaged' Buddhism that has revived or redirected traditional Buddhist ideas and practices found in meditation texts to reflect a greater social or worldly emphasis than suggested in earlier historical moments. One of these ideas is the quadripartite framework of the immeasurable states' (aprameya/appameya) or divine abidings' (brahmavihra), the most prominent of which in popular Buddhism is mett (friendliness/loving-kindness). This article traces the philosophy of the immeasurable states' found in meditation texts from various Indic traditions (Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu) and then presents the ways in which these traditional ideas (especially mett) have informed popular Buddhist movements in the twentieth century. Points of discussion include: engaged' Buddhism's relationship with traditional Buddhist ethics; arguments concerning the coalescence of monastic-centred meditation practices with popular Buddhist notions of social service; and the distinct utilization of mett in contemporary Buddhist societies in contrast to the mobilizing impulses of comparable religious communities (Hindu and Jain) with a similar heritage of mett discourse in South Asia.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of contemplation and meditation (CM) training, with a focus on developing great compassion, on the psychological well-being (PWB) of adolescents. Participants (N=51, mean age=15.8) were randomly allocated to either CM training (n=26) or a comparison group (n=25). Both groups completed measures of PWB before and after the intervention. Adolescents who received CM training showed statistically significant increases in environmental mastery and personal growth, as well as decreased negative affect compared to the comparison group. Girls in the experimental group also showed a significant decrease in negative affect compared with boys in the experimental group. Both the experimental and comparison groups demonstrated increased life satisfaction, environmental mastery, self-acceptance, autonomy, and purpose in life. There were no changes in positive affect and positive relations with others for both groups.

TI  - Domain-Specific Enhancement of Metacognitive Ability Following Meditation Training
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemplative mental practices aim to enable individuals to develop greater awareness of their own cognitive and affective states through repeated examination of first-person experience. Recent cross-sectional studies of long-term meditation practitioners suggest that the subjective reports of such individuals are better calibrated with objective indices; however, the impact of mental training on metacognitive ability has not yet been examined in a randomized controlled investigation. The present study evaluated the impact of a 2-week meditation-training program on introspective accuracy in the domains of perception and memory. Compared with an active control group that elicited no change, we found that a 2-week meditation program significantly enhanced introspective accuracy, quantified by metacognitive judgments of cognition on a trial-by-trial basis, in a memory but not a perception domain. Together, these data suggest that, in at least some domains, the human capacity to introspect is plastic and can be enhanced through training.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of compassion cultivation training: Effects on mindfulness, affect, and emotion regulation
T2  - MOTIVATION AND EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Compassion is a positive orientation towards suffering that may be enhanced through compassion training and is thought to influence psychological functioning. However, the effects of compassion training on mindfulness, affect, and emotion regulation are not known. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which 100 adults from the community were randomly assigned to either a 9-week compassion cultivation training (CCT) or a waitlist (WL) control condition. Participants completed self-report inventories that measured mindfulness, positive and negative affect, and emotion regulation. Compared to WL, CCT resulted in increased mindfulness and happiness, as well as decreased worry and emotional suppression. Within CCT, the amount of formal meditation practiced was related to reductions in worry and emotional suppression. These findings suggest that compassion cultivation training effects cognitive and emotion factors that support psychological flexible and adaptive functioning.

TI  - Effect of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction on Quality of Life (SF-36) and Spirometry Parameters, in Chemically Pulmonary Injured Veterans
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies have shown that Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has positive effect on physical and psychological dimensions of chronic illnesses. In this study for the first time we examine the effect of this new technique on quality of life and pulmonary function in chemically pulmonary injured veterans who have chronic pulmonary problem, psychological problems and low quality of life.Methods: Forty male pulmonary injured veterans were randomly replaced in two groups with 20 participants (MBSR and control Wait List (WL)). Then MBSR group received 8-weekly sessions intervention. We evaluate quality of life (used SF-36 questionnaire) and Spirometry parameters two times; before and after intervention in two group. We used "mixed factorial analyses of variance" test for analyzing data in each dependent variables. Then if we have significant interactional effect, we used "paired- sample t-test" for comparing before and after intervention data of each group, and "Independent-Sample t-test" for comparing after intervention data of two groups.Results: The MBSR compare to WL group improved SF-36 total score, (F (1, 38) = 12.09, P=0.001), "Role limitations due to physical problems"(F(1,38)= 6.92, P=0.01), "Role limitations due to emotional problems"(F(1,38)= 7.75, P=0.008), "Social functioning"(F(1,38)= 9.89, P=0.003), "Mental health"(F(1,38)= 15.93, P=0), "Vitality"(F(1,38)= 40.03, P <= 0.001), and "Pain"(F(1,38)= 27.60, P <= 0.001). MBSR had no significant effect on "FEV1" (F (1, 38) = 0.03, P=0.85),"FVC" (F (1, 38) = 0.16, P=0.69) and "FEV1/FVC" (F (1, 38) = 2.21, P=0.14).Conclusion: MBSR can improve individual's quality of life but not lung function in chemically pulmonary injured veterans.

TI  - The impact of mindfulness therapy combined with mentalization-based family therapy on suicidal ideation in adolescents with depressive disorder: randomized intervention study
T2  - ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Adolescents with depression who engage in non-suicidal self harming behaviors are more likely to adopt negative coping strategies when faced with negative events. Therefore, these patients should be introduced to positive coping strategies. Evidences have showed that mindfulness-based interventions can positively impact the psychology of patients with mental disorders. This study was to explore the impact of a combination of mindfulness therapy and mentalization-based family therapy (MBFT) on suicidal ideation in adolescents with depressive disorder. Methods Eighty adolescent patients with depression and suicidal ideation admitted to our hospital from September 2021 to February 2022 were selected as subjects. They were divided into a control group and a study group using the random number table method, with each group comprising 40 subjects. The control group received MBFT, whereas the study group received both mindfulness therapy and MBFT. The psychological status and suicidal ideations of the two groups were compared before and after the intervention. Results The psychological health scores of both groups of patients were lower after the intervention, with the scores of the study group being lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The scores on the suicidal ideation scales for both groups were lower after intervention, and the study group scored lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The absolute values of the differences in psychological health scale scores and suicidal ideation scale scores before and after the intervention were higher in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion The combination of mindfulness therapy and MBFT can improve the psychological condition of adolescents with depression, reduce their suicidal ideations, and help them develop a healthy and positive outlook toward life, making this method worthy of clinical recommendation.

TI  - Regulation of Mindfulness-Based Music Listening on Negative Emotions Related to COVID-19: An ERP Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to explore the behavioral and neural correlates of mindfulness-based music listening regulation of induced negative emotions related to COVID-19 using the face-word Stroop task. Eighty-five young adults visited the laboratory and were randomly assigned to three groups: a calm music group (CMG: n = 28), a happy music group (HMG: n = 30), and a sad music group (SMG: n = 27). Negative emotions were induced in all participants using a COVID-19 video, followed by the music intervention condition. Participants underwent the face-word Stroop tasks during which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The N2, N3, P3, and late positive component (LPC) were investigated. The results showed that calm music and happy music effectively regulate young adults' induced negative emotions, while young adults experienced more negative emotions when listening to sad music; the negative mood states at the post-induction phase inhibited the reaction of conflict control in face-word Stroop tasks, which manifested as lower accuracy (ACC) and slower reaction times (RTs). ERP results showed negative mood states elicited greater N2, N3, and LPC amplitudes and smaller P3 amplitudes. Further studies are needed to develop intervention strategies to enhance emotion regulation related to COVID-19 for other groups.

TI  - Mindfulness-What Works for Whom? Referral, Feasibility, and User Perspectives Regarding Patients with Mixed Chronic Pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe and predict the patients who would benefit from a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course and those for whom the conditions or timing are not optimal. The hypothesis was that patients' sociodemographic status would affect the effectiveness of MBSR.Methods: Data were collected by using mixed methods. Quantitative data were collected from a group of 58 patients who completed health-related questionnaires and from an evaluation 6 months after completion of a mindfulness course. Qualitative data were collected from three focus group interviews and seven case stories.Results: There were no significant differences in positive or negative outcomes after MBSR regarding any sociodemographic variables, and no clear predictors to identify patients best suited for participating in mindfulness were found. Techniques used by most patients (with or without positive outcome) were meditation and focus on breathing. Patients expressed positive feedback and reported positive changes they felt would last for the rest of their lives. Focusing on the issue of what works, four categories of interest were identified from the transcribed interviews: lessons learned, being oneself, permanence, and continuity as a condition for success.Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation makes a difference for patients. Patients felt rested and in better control of their pain and its role in their life. Only older age predicted better outcome, but patients who recognized that pain is part of their life and were living under stable conditions may have been more likely to learn and put forth personal effort, which may have made change possible. More specific variables have to be developed to study good match between the specific intervention and the specific patient.

TI  - Online mindfulness-based intervention for women with pregnancy distress: design of a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Psychological distress during pregnancy is common: up to 20% of the childbearing women experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. Apart from the adverse effects on the woman herself, pregnancy distress can negatively affect pregnancy outcomes, infant health, postpartum mother-child interaction and child development. Therefore, the development of interventions that reduce pregnancy distress is very important. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promising positive effects on pregnancy distress, but there is a need for randomized controlled trials with sufficient power. Trials on online MBIs, which are readily accessible and not expensive, also show positive effects on stress reduction in non-pregnant populations. Moreover, specific working mechanisms of MBIs remain unclear. The aim of the current study is to test the effectiveness of an online MBI in pregnant women with pregnancy distress, as well as exploring potential working mechanisms. Methods The current study is a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures. Consenting women with elevated levels of pregnancy distress will be randomized into an intervention group (MBI) or control group (care as usual) around 12 weeks of pregnancy, with an intended sample size of 103 women in each group. The primary outcome, pregnancy distress, will be assessed via questionnaires at baseline, halfway through the intervention and post intervention in both intervention and control group, and after 8 weeks follow-up in the intervention group. Secondary outcomes are mindfulness skills, rumination and self-compassion, which are also seen as potential working mechanisms, and will be assessed via questionnaires before intervention, halfway through the intervention, post intervention and after 8 weeks follow-up in the intervention group. Tertiary outcome variables are obstetric data and will be collected from the obstetric records for both intervention and control group. Analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Multilevel regression models for repeated measures (mixed models) will be used to evaluate changes in primary and secondary outcome variables. Tertiary outcomes will be compared between groups using independent t-tests and Chi Square analyses. Discussion The trial is expected to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of online MBIs during pregnancy in women with pregnancy distress and to evaluate potential working mechanisms.

TI  - Does mindfulness meditation increase empathy? An experiment
T2  - SELF AND IDENTITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivating empathy is a presumed benefit of mindfulness, but this possibility has rarely been investigated experimentally. We examined whether a five-minute mindfulness exercise would cultivate empathy relative to two equally brief control exercises: relaxation and mind-wandering. We further examined whether mindfulness would be especially beneficial for people with autistic or narcissistic traits. Results showed no effect of mindfulness relative to both control conditions on mind reading, empathic responding, or prosocial behavior. Mindfulness effects were independent of autistic traits. Unexpectedly, people higher in autistic traits did show increased prosocial behavior across conditions. Intriguingly, mindfulness improved mind reading in non-narcissistic people, but reduced it in narcissistic people. These findings question whether a brief mindfulness exercise is sufficient for building empathy.

TI  - Meditation and the Startle Response: A Case Study
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of two kinds of meditation (open presence and focused) on the facial and physiological aspects of the defensive response to an aversive startle stimulus were studied in a Buddhist monk with approximately 40 years of meditation experience. The participant was exposed to a 115-db, 100-ms acoustic startle stimulus under the 2 meditation conditions, a distraction condition (to control for cognitive and attentional load) and an unanticipated condition (startle presented without warning or instruction). A completely counterbalanced 24-trial, single-subject design was used, with each condition repeated 6 times. Most aspects of the participant's responses in the unanticipated condition did not differ from those of a comparison group of 12 age-matched male controls. Both kinds of meditation produced physiological and facial responses to the startle that were smaller than in the distraction condition. Within meditation conditions, open presence meditation produced smaller physiological and facial responses than focused meditation. These results from a single highly expert meditator indicate that these 2 kinds of meditation can differentially alter the magnitude of a primitive defensive response.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of Mindfulness-Based Group Visits for Smoking Cessation in Low-Socioeconomic Status and Minority Smokers with Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Smoking cessation studies tailored for low-income and racial/ethnic minority cancer patients are limited. African American and low-socioeconomic status (SES) smokers have higher cancer mortality rates and are less likely to use evidence-based smoking cessation treatments compared with white and higher SES counterparts. Mindfulness training is a promising approach to address racial and SES disparities in smoking cessation. The authors assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation (MBSC) medical group visit for low-income and racially diverse smokers with cancer. Design and intervention: The authors adapted the integrative medical group visit model used for chronic pain and included the You Can Quit smoking cessation curriculum used at the study site, Tobacco Treatment Center. The program was conducted in eight weekly 2-h visits. The authors then tested the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention for actively smoking cancer patients and cancer survivors in two pilot groups (N = 18) using a pre-post design. Setting/Location: This study took place at Boston Medical Center, a large urban safety net academic teaching hospital. Outcome measures: The authors used a medical group visit intake form to collect data on weekly cigarette intake and home practice. They also gathered additional qualitative data from focus groups and in-depth interviews. Results: Over 50% of participants (n = 10) self-identified as black and 56% reported an annual income of $20,000 or less. Over two-thirds of the participants attended four or more of the eight group visits. There was a significant decrease in weekly cigarette intake from 75.1 cigarettes at baseline to 44.3 at 3 months (p = 0.039). None of the participants quit smoking. Participants were satisfied with the program and reported positive lifestyle changes. Conclusion: MBSC group visits are feasible and acceptable among racially diverse and low-SES smokers with cancer and should be further studied in a larger cohort.

TI  - Impact of meditation training on the default mode network during a restful state
T2  - SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness meditation has been shown to promote emotional stability. Moreover, during the processing of aversive and self-referential stimuli, mindful awareness is associated with reduced medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity, a central default mode network (DMN) component. However, it remains unclear whether mindfulness practice influences functional connectivity between DMN regions and, if so, whether such impact persists beyond a state of meditation. Consequently, this study examined the effect of extensive mindfulness training on functional connectivity within the DMN during a restful state. Resting-state data were collected from 13 experienced meditators (with over 1000 h of training) and 11 beginner meditators (with no prior experience, trained for 1 week before the study) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Pairwise correlations and partial correlations were computed between DMN seed regions' time courses and were compared between groups utilizing a Bayesian sampling scheme. Relative to beginners, experienced meditators had weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions involved in self-referential processing and emotional appraisal. In addition, experienced meditators had increased connectivity between certain DMN regions (e.g. dorso-medial PFC and right inferior parietal lobule), compared to beginner meditators. These findings suggest that meditation training leads to functional connectivity changes between core DMN regions possibly reflecting strengthened present-moment awareness.

TI  - Assessment of Intuitive Eating and Mindful Eating among Higher Education Students: A Systematic Review
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The role of mindful eating (ME) and intuitive eating (IE) in improving eating behavior, diet quality, and health is an area of increasing interest. Objective: The objective of this review was to identify the instruments used to assess ME and IE among higher education students and outcomes related to these dimensions. Methods: This review was carried out according to the PRISMA statement, through systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Scopus. The inclusion criteria selected for higher education students, levels of ME and/or IE reported, and observational and clinical studies. The exclusion criteria selected against reviews, qualitative studies, and case studies. Quality was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist. Results: A total of 516 initial records were identified, from which 75 were included. Cross-sectional studies were the most common research design (86.7%). Most studies were conducted with samples that were predominantly female (90.7%), White (76.0%), aged 18 to 22 years (88.4%), with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (83.0%), and in the United States (61.3%). The Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ), and their different versions were the most used instruments. The outcomes most studies included were eating behavior and disorders (77.3%), anthropometric assessments (47.8%), mental health (42.0%), and body image (40.6%). Regarding the quality of studies, 34.7% of studies were assigned a positive, 1.3% a negative, and 64.0% a neutral rate. Conclusions: IES and MEQ were the most used instruments. RCT and cohort studies are scarce, and future research with a higher level of quality is needed, especially on the topics of food consumption, diet quality, and biochemical markers.

TI  - The Mindfulness-Based Phase-Oriented Trauma Therapy (MB-POTT): Hypnosis-informed mindfulness approach to trauma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPNOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypnosis has long been successfully used in the treatment of trauma and related disorders. In this paper, I describe a hypnosis-informed approach to PTSD using mindfulness. The Mindfulness-Based Phase-Oriented Traumatic Therapy (MB-POTT) follows the phase-oriented tradition that was originally proposed by Pierre Janet, later expanded by Daniel Brown and Erika Fromm using clinical hypnosis.MB-POTT comprises four distinct, yet recursive, stages: (1) therapeutic alliance building and symptom stabilization, (2) formation of a narrative about the trauma, (3) re-creation of meaning of life after trauma, and (4) future symptom management. In explaining these categories, I delineate the nature of mindfulness, both similarities and dissimilarities to hypnosis, with an emphasis on techniques that resemble hypnotic approaches (e.g., ego state therapy, ego-strengthening).Finally, I provide a case study in which MB-POTT was implemented with a client who suffered from PTSD after a near-fatal industrial accident.

TI  - Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: A Review of Therapeutic Role of Meditation Interventions
T2  - RESPIRATORY AILMENTS IN CONTEXT
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This review is an attempt to provide a comprehensive view of post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD) and its therapy, focusing on the use of meditation interventions. PTSD is a multimodal psycho-physiological-behavioral disorder, which calls for the potential usefulness of spiritual therapy. Recent times witness a substantial scientific interest in an alternative mind-to-body psychobehavioral therapy; the exemplary of which is meditation. Meditation is a form of mental exercise that has an extensive, albeit still mostly empiric, therapeutic value. Meditation steadily gains an increasing popularity as a psychobehavioral adjunct to therapy in many areas of medicine and psychology. While the review does not provide a final or conclusive answer on the use of meditation in PTSD treatment we believe the available empirical evidence demonstrates that meditation is associated with overall reduction in PTSD symptoms, and it improves mental and somatic quality of life of PTSD patients. Therefore, studies give a clear cue for a trial of meditation-associated techniques as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy or standalone treatment in otherwise resistant cases of the disease.

TI  - An affective neuroscience model of boosting resilience in adults
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Although research has identified dozens of behavioral and psychosocial strategies for boosting resilience in adults, little is known about the common underlying pathways. A comprehensive review of these strategies using an affective neuroscience approach indicates three distinct general routes to resilience: 1) down-regulating the negative (e.g., exposure, cognitive reappraisal) by reducing distress-related responses of the amygdala, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and autonomic nervous system; 2) up-regulating the positive (e.g., optimism, social connectedness) by activating mesostriatal reward pathways, which in turn can buffer the effects of stress; and 3) transcending the self (e.g., mindfulness, religious engagement) by reducing activation in the default mode network, a network associated with self-reflection, mind-wandering, and rumination. Some strategies (e.g., social support) can boost resilience via more than one pathway. Under- or over-stimulation of a pathway can result in vulnerability, such as over-stimulation of the reward pathway through substance abuse. This tripartite model of resilience-building is testable, accounts for a large body of data on adult resilience, and makes new predictions with implications for practice.

TI  - The effect of a 7-day intensive Buddhist meditation on existential isolation, interpersonal isolation, and compassion among South Koreans
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the effects of an intensive Buddhist (Zen) meditation practice on reductions in existential isolation and increases in prosocial behavior. This study also examines whether the hypothesized reduction in existential isolation resulting from the intensive meditation practice predicts other-focused compassion. Study 1 utilized a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of meditation on existential isolation and other compassion by comparing healthy Koreans who completed a 7-day intensive silent Zen meditation (n = 35) with those who completed a 7-day vacation (n = 30). All participants completed measures twice: at baseline and after either their meditation retreat or their vacation. Study 2 used a longitudinal design to investigate whether Study 1 findings would replicate among 75 new TempleStay program participants. In Study 1, relative to participants in the vacation group, participants in the meditation group experienced reduced existential isolation and increased other-focused compassion from Time 1 to Time 2. Reductions in existential isolation mediated the increases in other-focused compassion. In Study 2, after a 1-week intensive meditation training, participants experienced a reduction in existential isolation and an increased in other-focused compassion; again, the reductions in existential isolation mediated increases in other-focused compassion. Across two studies, we found evidence of reduced existential isolation and increased other-focused compassion following an intensive Zen-meditation practice. These results indicate that meditation practice may help people who suffer from existential isolation, as well as the people with whom they interact.

TI  - The customer is always right? Subjective target symptoms and treatment preferences in patients with psychosis
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinicians and patients differ concerning the goals of treatment. Eighty individuals with schizophrenia were assessed online about which symptoms they consider the most important for treatment, as well as their experience with different interventions. Treatment of affective and neuropsychological problems was judged as more important than treatment of positive symptoms (p < 0.005). While most individuals had experience with Occupational and Sports Therapy, only a minority had received Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Family Therapy, and Psychoeducation with family members before. Patients appraised Talk, Psychoanalytic, and Art Therapy as well as Metacognitive Training as the most helpful treatments. Clinicians should carefully take into consideration patients' preferences, as neglect of consumers' views may compromise outcome and adherence to treatment.

TI  - Cognitive Restructuring and Acceptance: An Empirically Grounded Conceptual Analysis
T2  - COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study explores the constructs of cognitive restructuring and acceptance using items from well-established measures of the respective constructs in order to determine what subcategories or conceptual nuances that could be empirically detected, and examines these factors' relationship to each other and to positive and negative emotionality, quality of life and clinical status. The design of the study is cross-sectional and uses data from both a clinical (N = 172) and a non-clinical sample (N = 638). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used to identify and validate first order factors related to cognitive restructuring and acceptance, and regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the identified factors and the criterion variables. In sum, the findings from the study indicate that acceptance and cognitive restructuring should not be regarded as unitary and non-related constructs, but rather as partly overlapping general dimensions of emotion regulation consisting of several sub constructs or conceptual nuances with somewhat different psychological functions and properties. The results are interpreted and discussed in relation to the ongoing discussion within clinical psychology concerning the concepts and processes related to cognitive restructuring and acceptance.

TI  - Mindfulness improves psychological quality of life in community-based patients with severe mental health problems: A pilot randomized clinical trial
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To examine the effectiveness of group mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in patients diagnosed with severe mental illness. The primary outcome was health-related psychological quality of life. Secondary measures were environmental, social and physical health related quality of life, frequency and intensity of psychotic symptoms and daily-life mindfulness.Method: Forty-four patients from a public community rehabilitation center for people with severe mental illness were recruited, and randomly allocated to Integrated Rehabilitation Treatment (IRT) or IRT plus MBI. Measures included PANSS interview, WHOQOL-BREF, and Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale. MBI comprised 26 one-hour weekly sessions. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.Results: One patient did not complete IRT + MBI and two did not complete IRT. At baseline there were no statistical group differences in demographic characteristics or primary and secondary outcomes. At post-treatment interaction between treatment and time in health-related psychological quality of life was statistically significant, and simple effect analysis showed significant differences for between and within subject factor in favor of MBI. Interaction was also significant in PANSS negative symptoms, simple effects showed a statistical trend in within subject factor. Time factor was significant in environmental and physical quality of life.Conclusions: Data suggest mindfulness added to IRT may enhance psychological quality of life in people with severe mental illness from a public community center. Results also suggest that mindfulness may impact frequency and intensity of negative symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Psychological and Non-Pharmacologic Treatments for Pain in Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Context. Pain is the most fearful symptom in cancer. Although there is a relationship between psychosocial variables and oncologic pain, psychological and non-pharmacological treatments for pain management in cancer patients are not very widespread.Objectives. To analyze the efficacy of psychological and non-pharmacological treatments for reducing pain in cancer patients.Methods. We performed a systematic review following the PRISMA protocol. In January 2021, data were extracted from PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, including randomised controlled trials (RCT) published in the last five years (from 28 January, 2015 to December 15, 2020), in the English language and whose sample was patients with cancer pain. The database search used the following keywords: cancer, cancer-related pain, psychological intervention, non-pharmacologic intervention. The Cochrane risk of bias assess ment for randomised trials (RoB 2) was used for quality appraisal.Results. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, ten papers were fully screened. The evidence suggested that the most effective interventions to reduce cancer pain were mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation and emotional and symptom focused engagement (EASE). Music therapy and brief cognitive behavioral strategies (CBS) require more research, while coping skills training and yoga did not show positive effects. Overall, we obtained a moderate size effect (d = 0.642, 95% CI: 0.125-1.158) favourable to psychological and non-pharmacologic treatments at posttreatment, which increased at follow-up (k = 5, d = 0.826, 95% CI: 0.141-1.511).Conclusion. This study provides insight into psychological interventions which might be applied and contribute to cancerrelated pain reduction in adults. Although the results are not completely consistent, they may shed light on psychology applications in the oncology environment. (C) 2021 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

TI  - For Whom Do Meditation Interventions Improve Mental Health Symptoms? Looking at the Roles of Psychological and Biological Resources over Time
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Engaging in meditation seems to be an effective manner of bettering psychosocial health. Although these findings hold for most people, individual differences may affect who gets greater gains from meditation. Psychological (i.e., resilience, spirituality) and biological (i.e., cardiac vagal tone, oxytocin) personal resources may work individually or synergistically to catalyze meditation-related improvements in mental health, such as increased positive (well-being) and decreased negative (depression) mental health symptoms. Methods A community-based sample of 210 adults (mode(age) = 35 years; 61.86% female) were recruited and randomly assigned to either mindfulness (n = 107; 51.2%) or loving-kindness (n = 102; 48.8%) meditation conditions (1 missing). The study lasted 18 months, starting with baseline measures, succeeded by a 6-week meditation intervention, and follow-up assessments every 3 months. Results The fixed effect of resilience was significant, as was the interaction between resilience and time, indicating different mental health symptom trajectories during and after a meditation intervention based on resilience. Conclusions Participants low in resilience tended to have the greatest gains (increased subjective well-being and decreased depressive symptoms) following a meditation intervention, yet these gains were not maintained 18 months following the intervention. Those high in resilience did not show mental health gains following a meditation intervention but did have higher subjective well-being symptoms 18 months following the intervention indicating that they may have experienced delayed gains.

TI  - The neurophysiological basis of compassion: An fMRI meta-analysis of compassion and its related neural processes
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Theoretical and neurophysiological investigations into compassion are burgeoning, yet the putative neural mechanisms which underpin such processes are less well understood. Therefore, we have conducted an Activation-Likelihood Estimate meta-analysis in order to ascertain the shared neural processes consistently identified as relevant to compassion. Our analysis of sixteen fMRI studies revealed activation across seven broad regions, with the largest peaks localized to the Periaqueductal Grey, Anterior Insula, Anterior Cingulate, and Inferior Frontal Gyrus. Overall, we identified a tendency for studies to operationalize compassion in one of three ways, as driven either 'top-down', 'bottom-up', or modified by target context. We failed to identify regions purportedly common to compassion such as the DLPFC, OFC, and Amygdala, possibly due to a small number of studies which used Loving-Kindness meditation. We argue future research in compassion science continue a multi-modal approach to examine links between neural activity and actual prosocial behavior, and recommend the application of fMRI paradigms on compassion with clinically diagnosed populations to parallel current trends in psychotherapy such as Compassion Focused Therapy.

TI  - Stress, coping and the acceptability of mindfulness skills among pregnant and parenting women living with HIV in the United States: A focus group study
T2  - HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnant and parenting women living with HIV (WLWH) face high levels of psychological stress and mental illness but lack tailored and acceptable psychosocial treatments. The research team sought to inform the adaptation of a mindfulness intervention for pregnant and parenting WLWH through focus groups exploring psychosocial treatment needs and mindfulness intervention preferences. The research team conducted focus groups with pregnant and parenting WLWH (n = 16) and case managers (n = 6) recruited from a community-based enhanced case management program. The research team utilised an iterative inductive approach to coding of the transcripts from these focus groups. Five themes emerged: stressors, signs of stress, coping, lack of access and acceptability of care, and motivation and trust in care engagement. These focus groups revealed a desire for a group intervention that could decrease isolation while protecting against involuntary disclosure of HIV status. Participants expressed openness to mindfulness skills for coping with stress. The focus group participants' preference for a non-stigmatising group intervention supports the potential of a mindfulness-based group intervention to reduce stress and improve the mental health of pregnant and parenting women living with HIV.

TI  - Cultivating connectedness: Effects of an app-based compassion meditation course on changes in global identity, nature connectedness, and pro-environmental behaviour
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual behaviour change and political measures are required to solve pressing global environmental crises such as climate change. Identification with an ingroup that includes all humanity (i.e., a global identity) was positively related to pro-environmental engagement in various studies, but little is known about how to foster a global identity. We argue that meditation with a focus on cultivating compassion might increase global identity because connectedness with people all over the world is a traditional goal of such practice. In a randomised controlled intervention study with pre-post design (N =164, Germany), participants received an app-based 7-day meditation course. Controlling for pre-survey levels, compared to the waiting control group, the meditation group reported stronger changes in global identity and pro-environmental behaviour but not climate policy support. We found that participating in the meditation course indirectly predicted changes in pro-environmental behaviour through a strengthened global self-investment, as one dimension of global identity. Moreover, we also found stronger changes in nature connectedness in the meditation group compared to the control group. Hence, a 7-day app-based compassion meditation course indeed seems to cultivate connectedness - with both humans and the broader natural world. Future research should compare different course curricula. Moreover, it should aim at diverse samples, longitudinal assessments, and investigate reasons for self-selecting in and dropping out of meditation-related studies.

TI  - Tendency to Worry and Fear of Mental Health during Italy's COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We tested whether the tendency to worry could affect psychological responses to quarantine by capitalizing on the opportunity of having collected data before the COVID-19 outbreak on measures of worry, anxiety, and trait mindfulness in a group of university students. Methods: Twenty-five participants completed self-report measures assessing worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ), anxiety (Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3), and trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS) at T0 (pre-lockdown, 4 November 2019-17 February 2020) and T1 (at the end of lockdown, 26 April-30 April 2020). We compared assessments at the two time points in the whole sample and in high and low worriers (defined at T0 by scores on PSWQ respectively above and below 1.5 SD from mean of the Italian normative sample). Outcomes: High worriers showed at T1 a significant increase of anxiety sensitivity and fear of mental health in comparison to low worriers. Moreover, in the whole sample, at T1 trait mindfulness was inversely related to worry and fear of mental health. Interpretation: A valuable approach to support individuals experiencing anxiety related to the COVID-19 outbreak could be represented by mindfulness-based interventions improving the ability to focus attention and awareness on the present moment.

TI  - A Comparison of Two Brief Present Moment Awareness Training Paradigms in High Worriers
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - High levels of worry are a common phenomenon in undergraduate populations, with 28 to 40% of undergraduates in introductory psychology courses classified as "high worriers." Worry is characterized by a pervasive neglect of the present moment and persistent thoughts about the future. Various methods of increasing present moment focus have been devised. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two brief present moment awareness training paradigms-Mindfulness Meditation and Present Moment Joy-in high worriers. Although both paradigms seek to increase present moment awareness, the processes by which each does so are different and potentially contradictory. Prior studies have not compared these two paradigms, and the field has yet to examine Present Moment Joy as an independent technique. Ninety-seven high worriers completed two, 20-minute training sessions across 2 days of either Mindfulness Meditation or Present Moment Joy. Participants rated levels of state mindfulness (curiosity and decentering), affect, and anxiety before and after each session. Both conditions increased curiosity and decentering, but Mindfulness Meditation led to greater decentering changes on day 2 than did Present Moment Joy. Both conditions decreased anxiety and negative affect. Only Present Moment Joy increased positive affect. Results suggest that, although Mindfulness Meditation and Present Moment Joy operate via different mechanisms, both increase present moment awareness and reduce anxiety and negative affect; however, when one's goal is also to increase positive affect, Present Moment Joy may be the more effective intervention.

TI  - Interventions to reduce post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in health care professionals from 2011 to 2021: a scoping review
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives This scoping review aimed to describe available interventions for decreasing (post-traumatic stress disorder) PTSD symptoms among healthcare professionals in hospital care. Method A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's framework. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest were searched for original research published in English from 2011 to 2021, on 8 July 2021. We included studies that described interventions that focused on reducing the PTSD symptoms of healthcare professionals. A narrative synthesis was adopted to synthesise the data. Results A total of eight studies out of 2558 articles were identified. Six used a quantitative study design and two adopted qualitative methods. cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness-based interventions were the most commonly adopted. Most studies used a combination of different intervention strategies. Trauma-related knowledge, emotion regulation and relaxation skill training, and psychological support from peers and psychologists were three core intervention components. The duration ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months. Healthcare professionals who participated in training programmes reported both positive experiences and suggestions for the improvement of PTSD-reducing interventions in their qualitative feedback. Conclusions The scoping review provides a practical summary of the intervention characteristics for reducing the PTSD symptoms of healthcare professionals. Hospitals and managers could use the overview of interventions to assist healthcare professionals with PTSD symptoms. More research investigating the effects of PTSD symptom-reducing interventions for healthcare professionals with appropriate follow-up assessments is needed in the future.

TI  - Meditation and the cultivation of virtue
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, social psychology has produced an expansive array of studies wherein introducing a seemingly morally innocuous feature into the situation a subject inhabits often yields morally questionable, dubious, or even appalling behavior. Several fascinating lines of philosophical enquiry issue from this research, but the most pragmatically salient question concerns how we ought most effectively to develop and maintain the virtues so that such putatively morally problematic behavior is less likely to occur. In this paper, I examine four empirically embedded accounts of virtue cultivation: Hagop Sarkissian's social signaling, Mark Alfano's virtue labeling, Nancy Snow's self-punishment, and Peter Railton's implementation intentions. But none of these accounts of virtue cultivation provides adequate resources for regulating our affective states, whose attention-constricting and behavior-priming functional roles are likely at the root of much of our less than virtuous behavior. Instead, I defend an account of virtue cultivation that proceeds via meditation, which can help us to identify and regulate our emotions and moods. Further, meditation enables us to develop the attentional focus, emotional intelligence, and sense of social connection that ground (many of) the virtues and, thus, our virtuous behavior.

M3  - Article
AB  - In French universities, only one out of two students is successful in his/her first year. The change of the working rhythm and the importance of self-regulated learning (relying on metacognition) can to a large extent explain these dramatic rates. Metacognition, as the process of being aware of one's own cognition and activity implies awareness and consciousness. Nowadays, its improvement has only been achieved through the training of monitoring for a specific task. Regarding awareness, techniques like meditation and relaxation (attentional practices or APs) lead to its general development. Therefore, we investigated the possible improvement of metacognition thanks to AP. We conducted a longitudinal study with two groups of students: one group took a training programme in autogenic training (an AP), and the second one received no training in awareness or metacognition. We found out that metacognition could be improved thanks to an AP. This approach could therefore be used as a global metacognitive remediation for students.

TI  - Psychological interventions to enhance positive outcomes in adult cancer caregivers: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This systematic review aims to examine the characteristics of psychological interventions that aim to enhance positive outcomes, such as wellbeing, post-traumatic growth, or hope in cancer caregivers. Studies published until December 2023 were searched on PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, WOS, PsycARTICLES and were included when examining interventions targeting positive outcomes with adult cancer caregivers. Of the 1424 articles retrieved through the databases, 16 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review, targeting 908 caregivers (70.2% female; Mage = 53.5). A narrative synthesis was used to describe the interventions, which were based on a variety of approaches such as psychoeducation, mindfulness, or Existential Behavioral Therapy, and reported positive gains for the positive outcomes. The results show few randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the contrast between the focus shift towards these outcomes and the need for systematic testing of the interventions, to be able to inform evidence-based service delivery.

AB  - A growing body of research suggests that meditation practices are associated with substantial psychological as well as physiological benefits. In searching for the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial impact of meditation, studies have revealed practice-induced alterations of neurotransmitters, brain activity, and cognitive abilities, just to name a few. These findings not only imply a close link between meditation and brain structure, but also suggest possible modulating effects of meditation on age-related brain atrophy. Given that normal aging is associated with significant loss of brain tissue, meditation-induced growth and/or preservation might manifest as a seemingly reduced brain age in meditators (i.e., cerebral measures characteristic of younger brains). Surprisingly, there are only three published studies that have addressed the question of whether meditation diminishes age-related brain degeneration. This paper reviews these three studies with respect to the brain attributes studied, the analytical strategies applied, and the findings revealed. The review concludes with an elaborate discussion on the significance of existing studies, implications and directions for future studies, as well as the overall relevance of this field of research.

TI  - Feeling Love and Doing More for Distant Others: Specific Positive Emotions Differentially Affect Prosocial Consumption
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating, recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness. Love-as a trait and a momentary emotionis unique among positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage prosocial behavior.

TI  - The limited prosocial effects of meditation: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many individuals believe that meditation has the capacity to not only alleviate mental-illness but to improve prosociality. This article systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the effects of meditation interventions on prosociality in randomized controlled trials of healthy adults. Five types of social behaviours were identified: compassion, empathy, aggression, connectedness and prejudice. Although we found a moderate increase in prosociality following meditation, further analysis indicated that this effect was qualified by two factors: type of prosociality and methodological quality. Meditation interventions had an effect on compassion and empathy, but not on aggression, connectedness or prejudice. We further found that compassion levels only increased under two conditions: when the teacher in the meditation intervention was a co-author in the published study; and when the study employed a passive (waiting list) control group but not an active one. Contrary to popular beliefs that meditation will lead to prosocial changes, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the effects of meditation on prosociality were qualified by the type of prosociality and methodological quality of the study. We conclude by highlighting a number of biases and theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this area.

TI  - The Nondiscriminating Heart: Lovingkindness Meditation Training Decreases Implicit Intergroup Bias
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although meditation is increasingly accepted as having personal benefits, less is known about the broader impact of meditation on social and intergroup relations. We tested the effect of lovingkindness meditation training on improving implicit attitudes toward members of 2 stigmatized social outgroups: Blacks and homeless people. Healthy non-Black, nonhomeless adults (N = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 6-week lovingkindness practice, 6-week lovingkindness discussion (a closely matched active control), or waitlist control. Decreases in implicit bias against stigmatized outgroups (as measured by Implicit Association Test) were observed only in the lovingkindness practice condition. Reduced psychological stress mediated the effect of lovingkindness practice on implicit bias against homeless people, but it did not mediate the reduced bias against Black people. These results suggest that lovingkindness meditation can improve automatically activated, implicit attitudes toward stigmatized social groups and that this effect occurs through distinctive mechanisms for different stigmatized social groups.

TI  - Psychological treatment of traumatic memories in COVID-19 survivors
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected a significant number of individuals worldwide, is generating serious mental health issues. Recovered COVID-19 patients have experienced traumatic events related to their symptoms, isolation, possible hospitalization, bereavement, fear of infecting loved ones and the physical consequences of COVID-19. One effective psychological treatment for these patients is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). The aim of this paper is to describe the therapeutic intervention and effects of EMDR in a pool of COVID-19 survivors referred to an integrated psychological/psychiatric outpatient service. Twelve patients, comprising of nine males and three females, underwent EMDR psychotherapy from October 2020 to February 2022. Each patient received 8-16 weekly treatment sessions. The standard EMDR protocol of eight stages was administered to enable desensitization and reprocessing of four main targets: first positive swab, hospitalization, isolation and fear for relatives' health. Efficacy of EMDR was demonstrated by the significant improvement at clinical scale for subjective distress caused by traumatic events. For the therapists, carrying out these treatments was an intense and challenging experience. In fact, the perceived distance between therapist and patient was less defined than in other hospital settings because the pandemic affects everyone equally. However, with the widespread availability of vaccines and although the pandemic is still ongoing with the emergence of new variants, a window of improvement in the mental health landscape is starting to open up.

TI  - Awareness of subtle emotional feelings: A comparison of long-term meditators and nonmeditators
T2  - EMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors explored whether meditation training to enhance emotional awareness improves discrimination of subtle emotional feelings hypothesized to guide decision-making. Long-term meditators and nonmeditators were compared on measures of self-reported valence and arousal, skin conductance response (SCR), and facial electromyography (EMG) to masked and nonmasked emotional pictures, and on measures of heartbeat detection and self-reported emotional awareness. Groups responded similarly to nonmasked pictures. In the masked condition, only controls showed discrimination in valence self-reports. However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination in the masked condition. These findings provide qualified support for the somatic marker hypothesis and suggest that meditation may influence how emotionally ambiguous information is processed, regulated, and represented in conscious awareness.

TI  - Exploring the Embodied Mind: Functional Connectome Fingerprinting of Meditation Expertise
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY: GLOBAL OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Short mindfulness-based interventions have gained traction in research due to their positive impact on well-being, cognition, and clinical symptoms across various settings. However, these short-term trainings are viewed as preliminary steps within a more extensive transformative path, presumably leading to long-lasting trait changes. Despite this, little is still known about the brain correlates of these meditation traits. METHODS: To address this gap, we investigated the neural correlates of meditation expertise in long-term Buddhist practitioners, comparing the large-scale brain functional connectivity of 28 expert meditators with 47 matched novices. Our hypothesis posited that meditation expertise would be associated with specific and enduring patterns of functional connectivity present during both meditative (open monitoring/open presence and loving- kindness and compassion meditations) and nonmeditative resting states, as measured by connectivity gradients. RESULTS: Applying a support vector classifier to states not included in training, we successfully decoded expertise as a trait, demonstrating its non-state-dependent nature. The signature of expertise was further characterized by an increased integration of large-scale brain networks, including the dorsal and ventral attention, limbic, frontoparietal, and somatomotor networks. The latter correlated with a higher ability to create psychological distance from thoughts and emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Such heightened integration of bodily maps with affective and attentional networks in meditation experts could point toward a signature of the embodied cognition cultivated in these contemplative practices.

TI  - Therapeutic intervention in fear of cancer recurrence in adult oncology patients: a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER SURVIVORSHIP
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose The study aims to provide an updated overview of studies that show the impact of psychotherapeutic interventions on fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), to explore the relationship between FCR and related factors (psychological distress, well-being, anxiety, depression, fear, coping strategies, quality of life), and to identify the most effective therapeutic approaches in managing FCR.Methods Three databases were searched between January 2021 and April 2021 using the key words "fear of cancer recurrence - psychotherapy - intervention" following the a priori established PRISMA protocol.Results Thirteen studies were included in the final review. The database search identified 239 potential papers. After removing duplicates and irrelevant articles by title and language, population, and type of study, 13 articles were assessed for eligibility of the abstract, and 13 full-text articles were reviewed and included in this systematic review. The studies were mainly from the Netherlands (4 out of 13). Positive benefits of therapeutic interventions on FCR were reported.Conclusions This research highlights challenges in using therapeutic approaches in dealing with FCR and its management. Therapeutic intervention is an effective means of managing not only FCR but also related factors (distress, well-being, quality of life). However, individual needs and preferences must be taken into consideration whilst choosing a therapeutic approach. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and mindfulness-based interventions are the most used approaches with CBT being the most effective, especially in a blended form (i.e. standard CBT combined with other self-help activities).Implications for Cancer Survivors The aim was to provide information about the most effective therapeutic approaches for coping with FCR.

TI  - Improving emotion regulation and mood in teacher trainees: Effectiveness of two mindfulness trainings
T2  - BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objective The present research investigated potential effects of mindfulness training on emotion regulation and mood of future schoolteachers in a nonrandomized pre-post design, and whether these are influenced by the yoga component of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and/or by homework practice. Method N = 169 university students received either mindfulness training (experimental groups), awareness activities (active control group), or no training (passive control group), in the context of university seminars. Allocation to groups was bound by the seminar chosen by participants, and in that sense was self-selected. Mindfulness was trained in two adapted MBSR courses, one of which including yoga, and the other excluding yoga. Results Specific benefits of both mindfulness training groups were observed for emotion regulation in terms of an increase in cognitive reappraisal and a reduction in symptom-focused rumination as well as depressive mood. No benefits of mindfulness training were observed for reductions in expressive suppression, self-focused rumination, anxious, and negative mood or an increase in distraction and positive mood respectively. Mindfulness training with and without yoga was mostly equally effective. Outcomes were largely not moderated by practice quantity or quality, but reductions in depressive mood were mediated by gains in reappraisal and distraction. Conclusions Mindfulness training can be implemented in the context of university seminars to foster advantageous emotion regulation strategies and lower depressive mood in future schoolteachers. Discontinuing yoga within mindfulness interventions does not seem to reduce training benefits.

TI  - The relationship between mindfulness, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, depression, and quality of life among cancer survivors living with chronic neuropathic pain
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine if mindfulness is associated with pain catastrophizing, depression, disability, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain (CNP).We conducted a cross-sectional survey with cancer survivors experiencing CNP. Participants (n = 76) were men (24 %) and women (76 %) with an average age of 56.5 years (SD = 9.4). Participants were at least 1 year post-treatment, with no evidence of cancer, and with symptoms of neuropathic pain for more than three months. Participants completed the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), along with measures of pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, pain interference, depression, and HRQOL.Mindfulness was negatively correlated with pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, pain interference, and depression, and it was positively correlated with mental health-related HRQOL. Regression analyses demonstrated that mindfulness was a negative predictor of pain intensity and depression and a positive predictor of mental HRQOL after controlling for pain catastrophizing, age, and gender. The two mindfulness facets that were most consistently associated with better outcomes were non-judging and acting with awareness. Mindfulness significantly moderated the relationships between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing and between pain intensity and pain interference.It appears that mindfulness mitigates the impact of pain experiences in cancer survivors experiencing CNP post-treatment.This study suggests that mindfulness is associated with better adjustment to CNP. This provides the foundation to explore whether mindfulness-based interventions improve quality of life among cancer survivors living with CNP.

TI  - Increases in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and decreases the rostral prefrontal cortex activation after-8 weeks of focused attention based mindfulness meditation
T2  - BRAIN AND COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mindfulness meditation is a form of attention control training. The training exercises the ability to repeatedly focus attention. We addressed the activation changes related to an 8-weeks mindfulness oriented focused attention meditation training on an initially nave subject cohort. Before and after training participants underwent an fMRI experiment, thus, although not strictly a cross over design, they served as their internal own control. During fMRI they exercised focused attention on breathing and body scan as compared to resting. We found increased and decreased activation in different parts of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by comparing pre- vs. post-mindfulness training (MT) during breathing and body scan meditation exercises that were compared against their own resting state. In the post-MT (vs. pre- MT) meditation increased activation in the right dorsolateral PFC and in the left caudate/anterior insula and decreased activation in the rostral PFC and right parietal area 3b.Thus a brief mindfulness training caused increased activation in areas involved in sustaining and monitoring the focus of attention (dorsolateral PFC), consistent with the aim of mindfulness that is exercising focused attention mechanisms, and in the left caudate/anterior insula involved in attention and corporeal awareness and decreased activation in areas part of the "default mode" network and is involved in mentalizing (rostral PFC), consistent with the ability trained by mindfulness of reducing spontaneous mind wandering.

TI  - Exploring Mindfulness and Mindfulness with Self-Compassion-Centered Interventions to Assist Weight Loss: Theoretical Considerations and Preliminary Results of a Randomized Pilot Study
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research explored whether developing mindfulness and self-compassion through meditation supports weight loss. The research addressed if (a) mindfulness meditation and (b) mindfulness with self-compassion Meditation (through loving kindness meditation and psychoeducational material to develop self-compassion) aid weight loss and maintenance. Sixty-three soldiers followed independent diet plans and were randomly assigned to a control group, or, one of the two meditation interventions for 5 weeks. Participants lost weight in both experimental groups, while the control group gained weight during the initial 5 weeks. Six months of subsequent, self-motivated and unguided meditative practice, revealed that only the mindfulness with self-compassion meditation group continued losing weight, while the mindfulness meditation group showed no significant weight differences. At a 1-year follow-up, both experimental groups regained some weight, while the control group paradoxically lost weight. Overall, however, the mindfulness with self-compassion meditation group lost significantly more weight than either of the two remaining groups (which did not significantly differ). The findings suggest that developing both mindfulness and self-compassion appears more promising for weight loss than developing mindfulness alone or simply dieting; nevertheless, weight maintenance requires more attention in future research.

TI  - Practice of Therapy Acquired Regulatory Skills and Depressive Relapse/Recurrence Prophylaxis Following Cognitive Therapy or Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. Method: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulnessbased cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. Results: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta =.177), and for DT (beta =.259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) =.232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [. 067,.806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). Conclusions: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination.

TI  - Mediators of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Younger Breast Cancer Survivors: Effects on Depressive Symptoms
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveDepression is associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer patients, with higher prevalence among younger women. Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated therapeutic effects, the mechanisms of intervention effects are poorly understood. We investigated whether rumination, self-kindness, intrusive thoughts about cancer, cancer-related worry, or a sense of meaning and peace mediated the intervention effects of an MBI, Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs), on depressive symptoms. Additionally, we explored the same variables as mediators of a psychoeducation program, Survivorship Education (SE). Methods Women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer at age <50 years were randomized to 6 weeks of MAPs (n = 85), SE (n = 81), or wait-list control (WLC; n = 81). During preintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up (FU), we assessed depressive symptoms, rumination, self-kindness, intrusive thoughts, worry, and meaning and peace. Results MAPs and SE significantly reduced depressive symptoms at postintervention, and reductions remained through 6-month FU for MAPs. Models revealed that reductions in rumination (beta = -0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.64 to -0.07) and intrusive thoughts (beta = 1.17, 95% CI = -2.17 to -0.37) and improvements in self-kindness (beta = -1.09, 95% CI = -2.37 to -0.28) and meaning and peace (beta = -1.09, 95% CI = -3.16 to -0.56) mediated MAPs' effects at all time points. Reductions in worry (beta = -1.34, 95% CI = -2.47 to -0.45]) mediated effects at postintervention only. Worry and intrusive thoughts mediated SE effects at postintervention and 6-month FU, respectively. Conclusions Findings identified depression-relevant mediators of MAPs' effects, expanding the understanding of MBI mechanisms. Results highlight pathways that could be leveraged to optimize intervention outcomes. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139.

TI  - The effectiveness of mindfulness meditation for nurses and nursing students: An integrated literature review
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: A growing body of literature has identified a range of beneficial physiological and psychological outcomes from the regular practice of mindfulness meditation. For healthcare professionals, mindfulness meditation is claimed to reduce stress, anxiety and burnout, and enhance resilience.Objective: The objective of this integrative review was to critically appraise the literature that related to the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation programs for nurses and nursing students.Design: This review was conducted using Whittemore and knafl's framework for integrated reviews.Data Sources: Using the terms mindfulness, mindfulness-based-stress reduction, Vipassana, nurses, and nurse education a comprehensive search of the following electronic databases was conducted: CINAHAL, Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE. EMCARE, ERIC and SCOPUS.Review Methods: The initial search located 1703 articles. After screening and checking for eligibility 20 articles were critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for qualitative papers and McMaster's Critical appraisal form for quantitative papers. The final number of papers included in the review was 16.Results: The results of this review identified that mindfulness meditation has a positive impact on nurses' and nursing students' stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, sense of well-being and empathy. However, the majority of the papers described small scale localised studies which limits generalisability.Conclusion: Contemporary healthcare is challenging and complex. This review indicated that mindfulness meditation is an effective strategy for preventing and managing the workplace stress and burnout, which so often plague nursing staff and students. Further studies with larger sample sizes using rigorous research methods would be useful in extending this work.

T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSystematic reviews and meta-analyses reveal the importance of an accepting attitude towards cancer for mental health and functional coping. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the German translation of the Peace, Equanimity, and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience (PEACE) questionnaire (Mack et al., 2008) and to investigate its associations with mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and related constructs.MethodsThe German version of the PEACE (PEACE-G) was created and validated with cancer patients in a cross-sectional two center questionnaire study. Construct validity was tested with confirmational factor analyses (CFA); Cronbach's alpha was used to determine internal consistency of items. We further examined associations with depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), distress (NCCN distress thermometer), HRQoL (SF-12), psychological flexibility (AAQ-II), resilience (RS-11) and acceptance scales, to evaluate concurrent and divergent validity.ResultsN = 213 cancer patients with different tumor entities participated in this study. Results of the CFA replicated the two-factor solution of the original PEACE (peaceful acceptance and struggle with illness) with satisfactory psychometric properties. Peaceful acceptance showed negative associations with depression, anxiety, distress, psychological inflexibility, and positive associations with HRQoL, acceptance, resilience, and mindfulness. Results of sensitivity analyses indicate a third factor (injustice/anger).ConclusionsThe results demonstrate the validity and reliability of PEACE-G in cancer patients and point to the essential role of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions in psycho-oncology. Further studies are needed to investigate the different facets of struggle with the cancer illness.

TI  - Older Adult Caregivers' Experiences in an Online, Interactive Mindfulness Intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. While today's older adults experience longevity, they often manage several chronic conditions and increasingly serve as informal caregivers for aging parents, children with life-long disabilities, and spouses. Older adult caregivers managing personal chronic illness often experience significant psychosocial hardships. Objective. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of older adult caregivers in an online, interactive mindfulness intervention. Methods. Self-reported older caregivers who participated in an online-based mindfulness program (n = 20) were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to provide feedback about any previous experience with mindfulness and/or meditation, hopes or goals held prior to the start of the program, desired expectations, motivation for joining, impressions of sessions, most beneficial topics, potential application of content, and any perceived effects. Participants' responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results. Five themes emerged from the analysis: Managing the Comprehensive Effects of Caregiving, Openness to Meditation and Mindfulness, Course Engagement and Incremental Growth, Building Rapport through Shared Experiences, and Ongoing Application and Opportunities for Refinement. Participants reported both short-term post-exercise benefits such as increased calm, relaxation, and stress relief, as well as long-term positive outcomes. Notably, participants found the program's unique interactive feature to be particularly beneficial as a form of perceived social support. Conclusions. Caregivers for older adults may derive benefit and potentially experience reduced subjective caregiver burden as a result of participating in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, particularly when the program is augmented with a self-compassion approach and perceived social support.

TI  - Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery (MMWR): Mindfulness-based intervention effects on residential substance use disorder treatment retention in a randomized controlled trial
T2  - BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we test the efficacy of Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery (MMWR), a mindfulness-based intervention adapted to support women with substance use disorder (SUD) while in residential treatment. We use a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a time-matched psychoeducation control to test MMWR effects on residential treatment retention. We used clinical staff-determined residential site discharge status and discharge date from the SUD treatment site record to determine retention. We tested for study group differences in retention defined as time to treatment non-completion without improvement (i.e., patient left treatment before completion of the treatment plan and made little or no progress toward achieving treatment goals based on clinical team determination), as well as differences in self-report of study intervention mechanisms of action (i.e., mindfulness, perceived stress, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, distress, affect, and drug and alcohol craving). The analytic timeframe for the survival analysis was from study intervention start date to 150 days later. The sample (N = 200) was female, majority amphetamine/methamphetamine users (76%), Hispanic (58%), with a history of incarceration (62%). By the 150-day analytic endpoint, the sample had 74 (37%) treatment Completers, 42 (21%) still In-residence, 26 (13%) Non-completers with satisfactory progress, and 58 (29%) Non-completers without satisfactory progress. Survival analysis of the intent-to-treat sample showed the risk of non-completion without improvement was lower in MMWR as compared to the control group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.16-1.08, p = .07). Both groups improved on select self-reported mechanism measure scores at immediate post-intervention, but only in the MMWR group did class attendance (dosage) have a large-size correlation with improved mindfulness (r = .61, p < .01), distress tolerance (r = 0.55, p < .01) and positive affect (r = 0.52, p < .01) scores. The hazard ratio for retention was of medium-to-large effect size, suggesting the clinical relevance of adding MMWR to an all-women's, ethnoracially diverse, SUD residential treatment center. An extended curriculum may be helpful considering the protective benefits of class attendance on psychological health indicators.

TI  - Short mindfulness meditation training: does it really reduce perceived stress?
T2  - COGNITIVE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To study whether an 8-week mindfulness meditation training program truly reduces perceived stress without designing a stress reduction program. An experimental study was performed in which we studied the effects of 8 weeks of MM training on attention and awareness, as measured by the MAAS (mindfulness attention awareness scale) and perceived stress, as measured by the PSQ (perceived stress questionnaire), in 80 volunteers from the general public recruited by email from university centers. An increase in the individual's dispositional capacity to be attentive and aware of the experience of the present moment in everyday life was observed in the experimental group versus the control group; F (2, 156) = 14.30, p = .000, eta 2 partial = .155. Perceived stress showed no significant differences between groups in: social acceptance; F (2, 156) = 2.30, p = .103, overload; F (2, 156) = 2.32, p = .101, irritability, tension and fatigue; F (2, 156) = 2.27, p = .106, energy and joy; F (2, 156) = 2.79, p = .065. MM practice for 8 weeks of training increases the individual's dispositional capacity to be attentive and aware of the experience of the present moment in everyday life but may not reduce perceived stress.

This gamma increase was specific for NREM sleep, was present throughout the entire night and correlated with meditation expertise, thus suggesting underlying long-lasting neuroplastic changes induced through prolonged training. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroplastic changes acutely induced by 2 intensive days of different meditation practices in the same group of practitioners. We also repeated baseline recordings in a meditation-naive cohort to account for time effects on sleep EEG activity.DesignHigh-density EEG recordings of human brain activity were acquired over the course of whole sleep nights following intervention.SettingSound-attenuated sleep research room.Patients or ParticipantsTwenty-four long-term meditators and twenty-four meditation-naive controls.InterventionsTwo 8-h sessions of either a mindfulness-based meditation or a form of meditation designed to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, hereafter referred to as compassion meditation.Measurements and ResultsWe found an increase in EEG low-frequency oscillatory activities (1-12 Hz, centered around 7-8 Hz) over prefrontal and left parietal electrodes across whole night NREM cycles. This power increase peaked early in the night and extended during the third cycle to high-frequencies up to the gamma range (25-40 Hz). There was no difference in sleep EEG activity between meditation styles in long-term meditators nor in the meditation naive group across different time points. Furthermore, the prefrontal-parietal changes were dependent on meditation life experience.ConclusionsThis low-frequency prefrontal-parietal activation likely reflects acute, meditation-related plastic changes occurring during wakefulness, and may underlie a top-down regulation from frontal and anterior parietal areas to the posterior parietal and occipital regions showing chronic, long-lasting plastic changes in long-term meditators.

TI  - Enhancing Compassion: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Compassion Cultivation Training Program
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychosocial interventions often aim to alleviate negative emotional states. However, there is growing interest in cultivating positive emotional states and qualities. One particular target is compassion, but it is not yet clear whether compassion can be trained. A community sample of 100 adults were randomly assigned to a 9-week compassion cultivation training (CCT) program (n = 60) or a waitlist control condition (n = 40). Before and after this 9-week period, participants completed self-report inventories that measured compassion for others, receiving compassion from others, and self-compassion. Compared to the waitlist control condition, CCT resulted in significant improvements in all three domains of compassion-compassion for others, receiving compassion from others, and self-compassion. The amount of formal meditation practiced during CCT was associated with increased compassion for others. Specific domains of compassion can be intentionally cultivated in a training program. These findings may have important implications for mental health and well-being.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness Training on Levels of Cortisol in Cancer Patients
T2  - PSYCHOSOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training intervention among cancer patients on levels of salivary cortisol, and further to explore if changes in psychological variables mediate intervention effects on cortisol. Methods: Patients with a previous cancer diagnosis (n = 71) were recruited and randomized into an intervention group or a waiting-list control group. The intervention consisted of an 8-week MBSR training course. Results: There were no overall effects of the intervention on cortisol levels at 3-month or 6-month follow-up. However, a significant effect of moderation was found showing a different intervention effect on awakening cortisol among participants with varying baseline level of cortisol. Among those with initial low levels of cortisol, there was an increase from baseline to 3-month follow-up, and among those with initial high levels there was a decreased level of cortisol at 3-month follow-up. There was no association between changes in psychological outcomes and cortisol levels. Conclusions: The results suggest an adjustment of cortisol levels as a result of MBSR. The study gives preliminary support indicating that MBSR can influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis functioning. The importance of these findings for future research in the field of mindfulness and stress reduction among cancer patients are discussed. (Psychosomatics 2013; 54:158-164)

TI  - Advancing breast cancer survivorship among African-American women
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances have occurred in breast cancer survivorship but, for many African-American women, challenges and gaps in relevant information remain. This article identifies opportunities to address disparities in breast cancer survival and quality of life, and thereby to increase breast cancer survivorship among African-American women. For breast cancer survivors, common side effects, lasting for long periods after cancer treatment, include fatigue, loss of strength, difficulty sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. For addressing physical and mental health concerns, a variety of interventions have been evaluated, including exercise and weight training, dietary interventions, yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction, and support groups or group therapy. Obesity has been associated with breast cancer recurrence and poorer survival. Relative to white survivors, African-American breast cancer survivors are more likely to be obese and less likely to engage in physical activity, although exercise improves overall quality of life and cancer-related fatigue. Considerable information exists about the effectiveness of such interventions for alleviating distress and improving quality of life among breast cancer survivors, but few studies have focused specifically on African-American women with a breast cancer diagnosis. Studies have identified a number of personal factors that are associated with resilience, increased quality of life, and positive adaptation to a breast cancer diagnosis. There is a need for a better understanding of breast cancer survivorship among African-American women. Additional evaluations of interventions for improving the quality of life and survival of African-American breast cancer survivors are desirable.

TI  - The Pursuit of Happiness and Its Relationship to the Meta-experience of Emotions and Culture
T2  - AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - In this commentary, I provide a brief background of the meta-experience of emotions, the philosophical and psychological literature on happiness, and further discuss the influence of culture on happiness. The meta-experience of emotions implies that there are primary and secondary emotions (i.e., emotions about emotions), similar to the concept of meta-cognitions. Primary and secondary emotions are closely associated with one's cultural background and happiness. Most scholars throughout history believe that happiness per se cannot be taught. However, it is possible to teach practices that lead to the path towards happiness. Promising strategies include loving-kindness and compassion meditation. These strategies are based on Buddhist teachings, which are deeply rooted in a collectivistic culture. This illustrates the close association among emotions, approaches towards happiness, and cultural background.

TI  - Prenatal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical and research implications
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to identify risk and protective factors related to general prenatal distress and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress to inform intervention targets among women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study relied on data obtained from U.S. pregnant women (N = 701) who participated in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study from May 21 to October 3, 2020. The present cross-sectional study examined the potential risk and protective factors associated with different features of prenatal distress among U.S. pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Approximately two-thirds of expectant mothers indicated being more stressed about going to the hospital because of COVID-19. Generalized anxiety and PTSD were associated with higher levels of general and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress. Depression symptoms were associated with higher general prenatal distress. Higher levels of distress tolerance were associated with lower levels of general prenatal distress (B = - 0.192, p < .001) and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress (B = - 0.089, p < .05). Higher levels of instrumental social support were marginally associated with lower COVID-19-specific prenatal distress (B = - 0.140, p < 0.1). Conclusion Findings draw attention to prenatal distress experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including new types of distress arising from the pandemic itself. Women might benefit from the introduction of interventions such as mindfulness-based or relaxation therapy. Coverage of responsibilities and financial assistance is particularly needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations include a majority White and high socioeconomic sample. These findings provide specificity regarding potential targets for addressing prenatal distress.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) for the Treatment of Co-occurring Schizophrenia and Pathological Gambling: A Case Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a paucity of interventional approaches that are sensitive to the complex needs of individuals with co-occurring schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Utilizing a single-participant design, this study conducted the first clinical evaluation of a novel and integrated non-pharmacological treatment for a participant with dual-diagnosis schizophrenia and pathological gambling. The participant underwent a 20-week treatment course comprising: (i) an initial phase of second-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and (ii) a subsequent phase employing a meditation-based recovery model (involving the administering of an intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training). The primary outcome was diagnostic change (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) for schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Secondary outcomes were: (i) psychiatric symptom severity, (ii) pathological gambling symptom severity, (iii) psychosocial functioning, and (iv) dispositional mindfulness. Findings demonstrated that the participant was successfully treated for both schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Significant improvements were also observed across all other outcome variables and positive outcomes were maintained at 3-month follow-up. An initial phase of CBT to improve social coping skills and environmental mastery, followed by a phase of meditation-based therapy to increase perceptual distance from mental urges and intrusive thoughts, may be a diagnostically-syntonic treatment for co-occurring schizophrenia and pathological gambling.

TI  - Association between Mindfulness and Weight Status in a General Population from the NutriNet-Sante Study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mindfulness is defined as non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. There is some evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in weight loss. However, this psychological concept has only been rarely explored in observational studies, and no study to date has examined the association between dispositional mindfulness and weight status in a large population-based sample.ObjectiveWe aimed to examine the relationship between mindfulness scores and weight status in a large sample of the adult general population in France.Design and MethodsA total of 14,400 men and 49,228 women aged >= 18 y participating in the NutriNet-Sante study were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We collected mindfulness data using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire as well as self-reported weight and height. The association between weight status and dispositional mindfulness, as well as its subscales (observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reactivity), was assessed using multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors.ResultsWomen with higher dispositional mindfulness scores were less likely to be overweight (excluding obesity) (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90) and obese (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.78). In addition, overall, in this group, all subscales were inversely associated with weight status, with the strongest association found for the "observing" subscale. In men, higher mindfulness was associated only with lower odds of obesity (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.81 (0.69, 0.96)), and only the "observing" and "non-reactivity" subscales were significantly inversely associated with weight status.ConclusionResults support the interest of a shift in perspective that takes into account positive psychological and cognitive factors such as dispositional mindfulness in the investigation of obesity and its associated factors.

TI  - Individual Differences in the Relationship Between Attachment and Nomophobia Among College Students: The Mediating Role of Mindfulness.
T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in nomophobia, which is defined as the fear of being out of cellular phone contact, or "feelings of discomfort or anxiety experienced by individuals when they are unable to use their mobile phones or utilize the affordances these devices provide". However, only limited research can be found in terms of its determinants at present. Contemporary literature suggests that the relationships among attachment styles, mindfulness, and nomophobia have not been investigated.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the mediating effect of mindfulness on the relationship between attachment and nomophobia. In addition, the study also focuses on gender differences in attachment, mindfulness, and nomophobia. A theory-based structural model was tested to understand the essentials of the associations between the constructs.METHODS: The Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, Nomophobia Questionnaire, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were used to collect data from undergraduate students (N=450; 70.9% women [319/450]; mean age=21.94 years [SD 3.61]). Two measurement models (ie, attachment and mindfulness) and a structural model were specified, estimated, and evaluated.RESULTS: The structural equation model shows that the positive direct effects of avoidant (.13, P=.03) and anxious attachment (.48, P<.001) on nomophobia were significant. The negative direct effects of avoidant (-.18, P=.01) and anxious attachment (-.33, P<.001) on mindfulness were also significant. Moreover, mindfulness has a significant negative effect on nomophobia for women only (-.13, P=.03). Finally, the Sobel test showed that the indirect effects of avoidant and anxious attachment on nomophobia via mindfulness were significant (P<.001). The direct and indirect effects of anxious attachment, avoidant attachment, and mindfulness altogether accounted for 33% of the total variance in nomophobia. Gender comparison results show that there is a significant difference in attachment based on gender (F2,447=6.97, P=.01, Wilk lambda=.97, partial eta2=.03). Women (mean 68.46 [SD 16.96]) scored significantly higher than men (mean 63.59 [SD 15.97]) in anxious attachment (F1=7.93, P=.01, partial eta2=.02). Gender differences in mindfulness were not significant (F4,448=3.45, P=.69). On the other hand, results do show significant gender differences in nomophobia (F4,445=2.71, P=.03, Wilk lambda=.98, partial eta2=.02) where women scored significantly higher than men.CONCLUSIONS: In general, individuals who are emotionally more dependent and crave more closeness and attention in the relationship tend to display higher levels of fear or discomfort when they have no access to their mobile phones. However, gender has a differential impact on the relationship between avoidant attachment and nomophobia. This study establishes the impact of mindfulness on nomophobia for women; therefore, future studies should test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy approaches and confirm whether they are effective and efficient. On the basis of significant gender difference in nomophobia and attachment, we conclude that gender should be taken into account in mindfulness-based treatments dealing with nomophobia.

TI  - Neural responses underlying extraordinary altruists' generosity for socially distant others
T2  - PNAS NEXUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most people are much less generous toward strangers than close others, a bias termed social discounting. But people who engage in extraordinary real-world altruism, like altruistic kidney donors, show dramatically reduced social discounting. Why they do so is unclear. Some prior research suggests reduced social discounting requires effortfully overcoming selfishness via recruitment of the temporoparietal junction. Alternatively, reduced social discounting may reflect genuinely valuing strangers' welfare more due to how the subjective value of their outcomes is encoded in regions such as rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala. We tested both hypotheses in this pre-registered study. We also tested the hypothesis that a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) training intervention would cause typical adults' neural and behavioral patterns to resemble altruists. Altruists and matched controls (N = 77) completed a social discounting task during functional magnetic resonance imaging; 25 controls were randomized to complete LKM training. Neither behavioral nor imaging analyses supported the hypothesis that altruists' reduced social discounting reflects effortfully overcoming selfishness. Instead, group differences emerged in social value encoding regions, including rostral ACC and amygdala. Activation in these regions corresponded to the subjective valuation of others' welfare predicted by the social discounting model. LKM training did not result in more generous behavioral or neural patterns, but only greater perceived difficulty during social discounting. Our results indicate extraordinary altruists' generosity results from the way regions involved in social decision-making encode the subjective value of others' welfare. Interventions aimed at promoting generosity may thus succeed to the degree they can increase the subjective valuation of others' welfare.

TI  - Lessons for the Health-care Practitioner from Buddhism.
T2  - Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - From its earliest days, Buddhism has been closely intertwined with the practice of medicine, both being concerned in their own way in the alleviation and prevention of human suffering. However, while the connection between Buddhism and healthcare has long been noted, there is scarce literature on how Buddhist philosophy can guide health-care practitioners in their professional as well as personal lives. In the sutras, we find analogies that describe the Buddha as a doctor, knowledge of Dharma as the treatment, and all lay people as patients. The occurrence of disease is closely related to one's mental, physical and spiritual health, society, culture, and environment. It is not enough to approach medicine in a manner that simply eradicates symptoms; the psychosocial aspects of disease and its mind based causes and remedies must be a primary consideration. Holistic care involves harmonization of all these elements, and the Buddhist philosophy offers great insight for the physician. The Buddhist medical literature lays out moral guidelines and ethics for a health-care practitioner and this has corollaries in the principles of medical ethics: nonmaleficence, benevolence, justice, and autonomy. There is emphasis on loving-kindness, compassion, empathy, and equanimity as key attributes of an ideal physician. The practice of medicine is a stressful profession with physician burnout an often neglected problem. Mindfulness meditation, as developed in Buddhism, can help health-care professionals cope up with the stress and develop the essential attributes to improve patient care and self-care. This article outlines the spiritual and ethical values which underlie Buddhist concern for the sick and gives an overview of lessons which health-care practitioners can imbibe from Buddhism.

TI  - "I Felt It and I Let It Go": Perspectives on Meditation and Emotional Regulation among Female Survivors of Interpersonal Trauma with Co-occurring Disorders
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Emotional dysregulation poses significant challenges for women who have experienced trauma and can contribute to problems with substance use in an attempt to manage intense emotions and arousal. Various forms of meditation have shown benefits for improved awareness and management of emotions and offer a promising complementary treatment for women in residential substance use treatment who have histories of interpersonal traumas. This qualitative study explored lived experiences with meditation practice and emotional regulation among female trauma survivors with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders. Thirty-two trauma survivors participated in a six-week curriculum at their residential treatment program that included mindfulness, compassion, and loving-kindness meditations. Using an emergent design based on the constant comparative method, the study analyzed qualitative data from individual interviews and focus groups and identified common themes. The findings indicated a perceived pathway through which meditation promoted emotional regulation. This pathway started with increased awareness of their emotions, involved the ability to then accept and let go of their emotions, and ended with emotional growth and improved self-regulation. Though participants portrayed meditation as beneficial, several participants also described suppressed emotions and traumatic memories resurfacing during meditation and described the importance of support from program staff outside of group to help them process and cope. The participants' perspectives support the appropriateness of meditation as an empowering complementary intervention for female trauma survivors with co-occurring disorders, but also indicate the importance of supervision and support at the start of meditation practice in case negative experiences arise.

TI  - Meditation experience is associated with differences in default mode network activity and connectivity
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many philosophical and contemplative traditions teach that "living in the moment" increases happiness. However, the default mode of humans appears to be that of mind-wandering, which correlates with unhappiness, and with activation in a network of brain areas associated with self-referential processing. We investigated brain activity in experienced meditators and matched meditation-naive controls as they performed several different meditations (Concentration, Loving-Kindness, Choiceless Awareness). We found that the main nodes of the default-mode network (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) were relatively deactivated in experienced meditators across all meditation types. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger coupling in experienced meditators between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (regions previously implicated in self-monitoring and cognitive control), both at baseline and during meditation. Our findings demonstrate differences in the default-mode network that are consistent with decreased mind-wandering. As such, these provide a unique understanding of possible neural mechanisms of meditation.

TI  - An Introduction to Compassion Focused Therapy in Cognitive Behavior Therapy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines the early origins of Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) from within the Cognitive Behavioral tradition (CBT). It will then focus on how our new understanding in the areas of affect regulation systems, and the importance of affiliative and kind relationships in regulating mental states, point to key processes that underpin mental health difficulties-as well as to possible mechanisms for therapy and change. CFT recognizes the huge debt to Eastern psychologies such as Buddhism that have articulated the importance of compassion for our personal and social well-being for thousands of years. However CFT was originally developed for, and with, people who suffer from high levels of shame and self-criticism and who find experiences of support, kindness, and compassion-both from themselves and from others-difficult or even frightening. The article will provide the conceptual background for the articles that follow which focus on the applications of CFT.

TI  - Meditation focused on self-observation of the body impairs metacognitive efficiency
T2  - CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade of research on metacognition, the literature has been focused on understanding its mechanism, function and scope; however, little is known about whether metacognitive capacity can be trained. The specificity of the potential training procedure is in particular still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluate whether metacognition is trainable through generic meditation training, and if so, which component of meditation would be instrumental in this improvement. To this end, we evaluated participants' metacognitive efficiency before and after two types of meditation training protocols: the first focused on mental cues (Mental Monitoring [MM] training), whereas the second focused on body cues (Self-observation of the Body [SoB] training). Results indicated that while metacognitive efficiency was stable in MM training group, it was significantly reduced in the SoB group after training. This suggests that metacognition should not be conceived as a stable capacity but rather as a malleable skill.

TI  - How Positive Emotions Build Physical Health: Perceived Positive Social Connections Account for the Upward Spiral Between Positive Emotions and Vagal Tone
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanisms underlying the association between positive emotions and physical health remain a mystery. We hypothesize that an upward-spiral dynamic continually reinforces the tie between positive emotions and physical health and that this spiral is mediated by people's perceptions of their positive social connections. We tested this overarching hypothesis in a longitudinal field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group that self-generated positive emotions via loving-kindness meditation or to a waiting-list control group. Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions relative to those in the control group, an effect moderated by baseline vagal tone, a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions, in turn, produced increases in vagal tone, an effect mediated by increased perceptions of social connections. This experimental evidence identifies one mechanismperceptions of social connectionsthrough which positive emotions build physical health, indexed as vagal tone. Results suggest that positive emotions, positive social connections, and physical health influence one another in a self-sustaining upward-spiral dynamic.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness training on decision-making in critical and high-demand situations: A pilot study in combat aviation
T2  - SAFETY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study investigated the effects of a mindfulness-based training program (Attentional Regulation Optimization) on decision-making in an elite population operating in a highly-demanding context, namely the actions of fighter pilots in critical flight situations that lead to ejection. Our hypothesis was that both mindfulness skills and decision-making performance would improve in pilots who participated in the ARO program (n = 7), compared to a control group (n = 8). Mindfulness skills were measured with the FFMQ-15. Decision-making performance was evaluated in two tests that were implemented in scenarios in a full flight simulator. Five dependent variables were assessed, corresponding to the phases of the decision-making process when faced with an in-flight failure: reaction time after the first failure input, correctness of the first action, emergency procedure score, ejection procedure score, and quality of ejection. Adherence to the ARO program was assessed with the number of out-of-class individual mindfulness sessions and the number of out-of-class body-mind scans. No statistically significant improvement in mindfulness skills for the ARO group compared to the control group were found. Reaction time was significantly shortened for the ARO group compared to the control group-but only for complex failures. A positive effect on the correctness of the first action was also found. On the other hand, ARO training had no significant effect on the downstream phases of decision-making (emergency pro-cedure score, ejection procedure score and quality of ejection). Given the small sample size, these results must be considered with caution. However, they open up interesting avenues for future work, notably with regard to the benefits of mindfulness training on perceptual and atten-tional skills (to detect flight failure cues) and cognitive control skills (to diagnose and select appropriate pro-cedures). From an operational perspective, the program appears to have beneficial effects on safety and performance in elite populations who must face critical situations.

TI  - Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention Program as an Adjunct to the Standard Treatment for Smoking: A Pragmatic Design Pilot Study
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Posttreatment relapse is a major roadblock to stemming the global epidemic of tobacco-related illness. This article presents results from a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and initial efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) as an adjunct to standard relapse prevention treatment (ST) for smoking cessation.Aims and Methods: Smokers (n = 86) in the maintenance phase of treatment were randomized to receive either ST plus MBRP (MBRP) (n = 44) or ST alone (ST) (n = 42). Data were collected at baseline and at 4-, 12-, and 24-week follow-up points. We evaluated the feasibility of the protocol with frequency analysis, and the efficacy with both intention to treat and complete case analyses of the effects of MBRP on abstinence. Secondary outcomes included mindfulness, craving, depression, anxiety, and positive/negative affect.Results: High adherence suggested MBRP is acceptable and feasible. Participants in the MBRP group reported increases in mindfulness (M = -7.833, p =.016), and reductions in craving (M = 17.583, p =.01) compared with the ST group. Intention to treat analysis found that, compared with MBRP (36.4%), ST (57.1%) showed trend-level superiority in abstinence at Week 4 (Prevalence Ratio = 0.63, p =.06); however at Week 24, the ST group (14.3%) demonstrated a twofold greater decrease in abstinence, compared with the MBRP group (20.1%) (Prevalence Ratio = 2.25, p =.08). Therefore, the MBRP group maintained a higher abstinence rate for longer. Reported effects were greater in the complete case analysis.Conclusions: MBRP holds promise for preventing relapse after aided tobacco quit attempts.Implications: Findings suggest that MBRP is acceptable, feasible, and valued by participants. At 24-week follow-up, there was a large effect size and a statistical trend toward fewer MBRP patients relapsing compared with ST patients. MBRP conferred ancillary benefits including reductions in craving and increases in levels of mindfulness. MBRP for tobacco cessation is highly promising and merits further research.

TI  - The role of self body brushing vs mindfulness meditation on interoceptive awareness: A non-randomized pilot study on healthy participants with possible implications for body image disturbances
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Adaptive interoceptive awareness has been revealed to be an important factor for mental health. Touch is one of the modalities through which we perceive bodily feelings. In this pilot study, self touch's role in enhancing interoceptive awareness was investigated. It was tested by means of a Self Body Brushing (SBB) procedure, which entails self-administered brushing of the entire body.Methods: A pre vs. post three-arm design was used, with 49 healthy adult participants. The SBB training was delivered to a first group (N = 13) and a Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) training to a second group (N = 15), considered as a reference intervention for promoting interoceptive awareness; a third group of inactive control participants (N = 14) was also included. Assessment included two self-report questionnaires: the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).Results: In several MAIA scales significant changes were observed: for Noticing, Attention regulation and Body listening, an overall improvement was observed, which was particularly due to changes in the active groups (SBB and MOM); Emotional awareness and Self-regulation scores increased more in the SBB group than in the other two groups. In the PSS measure, the changes in the active groups did not produce a statistically significant effect relative to the control group.Conclusions: SBB led to improvements in several aspects of self-reported interoceptive awareness at least as well as mindfulness meditation training. Further studies could investigate the potential effectiveness of SBB for promoting individual psychophysical health and well-being, in particular in the case of body image disturbances.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for family carers of people with dementia
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundCaring for people with dementia is highly challenging, and family carers are recognised as being at increased risk of physical and mental ill-health. Most current interventions have limited success in reducing stress among carers of people with dementia. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) draws on a range of practices and may be a promising approach to helping carers of people with dementia.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing the stress of family carers of people with dementia.Search methodsWe searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 9 of 12, 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1950 to September 2017), Embase (Ovid SP 1974 to Sepetmber 2017), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science 1945 to September 2017), PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to September 2017), CINAHL (all dates to September 2017), LILACS (all dates to September 2017), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 6 September 2017, with no language restrictions.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MBSR for family carers of people with dementia.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently screened references for inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information, then conducted meta-analyses, or reported results narratively in the case of insufficient data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsWe included five RCTs involving 201 carers assessing the effectiveness of MBSR. Controls used in included studies varied in structure and content. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes were compared with either active controls (those matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. education, social support, or progressive muscle relaxation), or inactive controls (those not matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. self help education or respite care). One trial used both active and inactive comparisons with MBSR. All studies were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about selective reporting, incomplete outcome data, or allocation concealment.1. Compared with active controls, MBSR may reduce depressive symptoms of carers at the end of the intervention (3 trials, 135 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD)-0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI)-0.98 to -0.28; P<0.001; low-quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low-quality evidence).Mindfulness-based stress reduction compared with active control may decrease carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 78 participants; mean difference (MD) -7.50, 95% CI-13.11 to -1.89; P<0.001; low-quality evidence) and may slightly increase carer burden (3 trials, 135 participants; SMD 0.24, 95% CI-0.11 to 0.58; P=0.18; low-quality evidence), although both results were imprecise, and we could not exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be sure of any effect on carers' coping style, nor could we determine whether carers were more or less likely to drop out of treatment.2. Compared with inactive controls, MBSR showed no clear evidence of any effect on depressive symptoms (2 trials, 50 participants; MD-1.97, 95% CI-6.89 to 2.95; P=0.43; low-quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low-quality evidence).In this comparison, MBSR may also reduce carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 33 participants; MD-7.27, 95% CI 14.92 to 0.38; P=0.06; low-quality evidence), although we were unable to exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be certain of any effects of MBSR on carer burden, the use of positive coping strategies, or dropout rates.We found no studies that looked at quality of life of carers or care-recipients, or institutionalisation.Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting a single adverse event related to yoga practices at homeAuthors' conclusionsAfter accounting for non-specific effects of the intervention (i.e. comparing it with an active control), low-quality evidence suggests that MBSR may reduce carers' depressive symptoms and anxiety, at least in the short term.There are significant limitations to the evidence base on MBSR in this population. Our GRADE assessment of the evidence was low to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily because of high risk of detection or performance bias, and imprecision.In conclusion, MBSR has the potential to meet some important needs of the carer, but more high-quality studies in this field are needed to confirm its efficacy.

TI  - Meditating in Virtual Reality: Proof-of-Concept Intervention for Posttraumatic Stress
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We investigate the potential therapeutic application of virtual reality (VR) technology as an aid to meditation practice among persons varying in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method: In this within-group mixed-methods study, 96 young adults practiced both VR- and non-VR-guided meditations and reported on their experience of positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), other meditative experiences and perceived satisfaction-credibility of each meditation. Results: Participants reported more PA and greater perceived satisfaction-credibility following the VR as compared to non-VR-guided meditations primarily when the VR meditation was practiced first, before the non-VR meditation, as opposed to vice versa. The experience of NA during meditation practice was infrequent, although persons with increased PTSD symptoms reported increased distress during both VR and non-VR meditation. Conclusions: Further study of therapeutic applications of VR as an aid to meditation practice among people with PTSD symptoms is warranted.

TI  - Attentional and cognitive monitoring brain networks in long-term meditators depend on meditation states and expertise
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meditation practice is suggested to engage training of cognitive control systems in the brain. To evaluate the functional involvement of attentional and cognitive monitoring processes during meditation, the present study analysed the electroencephalographic synchronization of fronto-parietal (FP) and medial-frontal (MF) brain networks in highly experienced meditators during different meditation states (focused attention, open monitoring and loving kindness meditation). The aim was to assess whether and how the connectivity patterns of FP and MF networks are modulated by meditation style and expertise. Compared to novice meditators, (1) highly experienced meditators exhibited a strong theta synchronization of both FP and MF networks in left parietal regions in all mediation styles, and (2) only the connectivity of lateralized beta MF networks differentiated meditation styles. The connectivity of intra-hemispheric theta FP networks depended non-linearly on meditation expertise, with opposite expertise-dependent patterns found in the left and the right hemisphere. In contrast, inter-hemispheric FP connectivity in faster frequency bands (fast alpha and beta) increased linearly as a function of expertise. The results confirm that executive control systems play a major role in maintaining states of meditation. The distinctive lateralized involvement of FP and MF networks appears to represent a major functional mechanism that supports both generic and style-specific meditation states. The observed expertise-dependent effects suggest that functional plasticity within executive control networks may underpin the emergence of unique meditation states in expert meditators.
