TI  - Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery (MMWR): Mindfulness-based intervention 
      effects on residential substance use disorder treatment retention in a randomized 
      controlled trial.

AB  - In this study we test the efficacy of Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery 
      (MMWR), a mindfulness-based intervention adapted to support women with substance 
      use disorder (SUD) while in residential treatment. We use a parallel-group 
      randomized controlled trial with a time-matched psychoeducation control to test 
      MMWR effects on residential treatment retention. We used clinical 
      staff-determined residential site discharge status and discharge date from the 
      SUD treatment site record to determine retention. We tested for study group 
      differences in retention defined as time to treatment non-completion without 
      improvement (i.e., patient left treatment before completion of the treatment plan 
      and made little or no progress toward achieving treatment goals based on clinical 
      team determination), as well as differences in self-report of study intervention 
      mechanisms of action (i.e., mindfulness, perceived stress, distress tolerance, 
      emotion regulation, distress, affect, and drug and alcohol craving). The analytic 
      timeframe for the survival analysis was from study intervention start date to 150 
      days later. The sample (N = 200) was female, majority amphetamine/methamphetamine 
      users (76%), Hispanic (58%), with a history of incarceration (62%). By the 
      150-day analytic endpoint, the sample had 74 (37%) treatment Completers, 42 (21%) 
      still In-residence, 26 (13%) Non-completers with satisfactory progress, and 58 
      (29%) Non-completers without satisfactory progress. Survival analysis of the 
      intent-to-treat sample showed the risk of non-completion without improvement was 
      lower in MMWR as compared to the control group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% 
      CI: 0.16-1.08, p = .07). Both groups improved on select self-reported mechanism 
      measure scores at immediate post-intervention, but only in the MMWR group did 
      class attendance (dosage) have a large-size correlation with improved mindfulness 
      (r = .61, p < .01), distress tolerance (r = 0.55, p < .01) and positive affect 
      (r = 0.52, p < .01) scores. The hazard ratio for retention was of medium-to-large 
      effect size, suggesting the clinical relevance of adding MMWR to an all-women's, 
      ethnoracially diverse, SUD residential treatment center. An extended curriculum 
      may be helpful considering the protective benefits of class attendance on 
      psychological health indicators.

TI  - Practice of therapy acquired regulatory skills and depressive relapse/recurrence 
      prophylaxis following cognitive therapy or mindfulness based cognitive therapy.
PG  - 161-170
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate whether usage of treatment-acquired regulatory skills 
      is associated with prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. METHOD: Remitted 
      depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly 
      group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the 
      criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. RESULTS: Factor analysis 
      identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress 
      tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and 
      MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed 
      positive slopes for DC (β = .177), and for DT (β = .259), but not for RS (β = 
      -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox 
      regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of 
      relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval 
      (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and 
      medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct 
      effect on relapse/recurrence (β = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through 
      an indirect path (β = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills 
      following treatment promoted increases in DC (β = .462), which, in turn, 
      predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (β = -.270). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend 
      upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the 
      acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is 
      strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination.

TI  - Polysomnographic and subjective profiles of sleep continuity before and after 
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in partially remitted depression.
PG  - 539-48
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181dc1bad [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether mindfulness meditation (MM) was associated with 
      changes in objectively measured polysomnographic (PSG) sleep profiles and to 
      relate changes in PSG sleep to subjectively reported changes in sleep and 
      depression within the context of a randomized controlled trial. Previous studies 
      have indicated that mindfulness and other forms of meditation training are 
      associated with improvements in sleep quality. However, none of these studies 
      used objective PSG sleep recordings within longitudinal randomized controlled 
      trials of naïve subjects. METHODS: Twenty-six individuals with partially remitted 
      depression were randomized into an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy 
      (MBCT) course or a waitlist control condition. Pre-post measurements included PSG 
      sleep studies and subjectively reported sleep and depression symptoms. RESULTS: 
      According to PSG sleep, MM practice was associated with several indices of 
      increased cortical arousal, including more awakenings and stage 1 sleep and less 
      slow-wave sleep relative to controls, in proportion to amount of MM practice. 
      According to sleep diaries, subjectively reported sleep improved post MBCT but 
      not above and beyond controls. Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased more in 
      the MBCT group than controls. Improvements in depression were associated with 
      increased subjective sleep continuity and increased PSG arousal. CONCLUSIONS: MM 
      is associated with increases in objectively measured arousal during sleep with 
      simultaneous improvements in subjectively reported sleep quality and mood 
      disturbance. This pattern is similar to the profiles of positive responders to 
      common antidepressant medications.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions can enhance cognitive abilities among older 
      adults, thereby effectively delaying cognitive decline. These cognitive 
      enhancements are theorized to accompany neuroplastic changes in the brain. 
      However, this mindfulness-associated neuroplasticity has yet to be documented 
      adequately. A randomized controlled trial was carried out among participants with 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based 
      intervention on various cognitive outcomes and cortical thickness (CT) in the 
      context of age-related cognitive impairment. Participants were assigned to a 
      mindfulness awareness program (MAP)(n = 27) and an active control condition - 
      health education program (n = 27). In both, they attended weekly sessions for 
      three months and subsequently, monthly sessions for six months. Cognitive 
      assessments and structural scans were carried out across three time-points. Whole 
      brain analyses on CT were carried out and were supplemented with region of 
      interest-based analyses. ROI values and cognitive outcomes were analyzed with 
      mixed MANOVAs and followed up with univariate ANOVAs. Nine-month MAP-associated 
      gains in working memory span and divided attention, along with an increased CT in 
      the right frontal pole and decreased CT in the left anterior cingulate were 
      observed. Three-month MAP-associated CT increase was observed in the left 
      inferior temporal gyrus but did not sustain thereafter. MAP led to significant 
      cognitive gains and various CT changes. Most of these neurobehavioral changes, 
      may require sustained effort across nine months, albeit at a reduced intensity. 
      MAP can remediate certain cognitive impairments and engender neuroplastic effects 
      even among those with MCI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The low level of psychological well-being is one of the most common 
      problems of the women who are the heads of households, and various educational 
      programs have been conducted to improve the psychological well-being of such a 
      group. The present study was conducted to outline the effectiveness of 
      mindfulness-based educational intervention in the psychological well-being of 
      women as the heads of households. METHODS: This research as a semi-experimental 
      study was done by pretest-posttest design and control group. The study 
      statistical population included all women as the heads of households in Shiraz, 
      who had a file in the Shiraz based welfare office and at the same time their 
      children were studying in schools covered by the 2nd district educational 
      department of Shiraz in 2022-2023. Out of the female heads of the households in 
      the statistical community, 30 women were selected as Purposive sampling and then 
      randomly divided into two 15-individual groups, including experimental group 
      (training on mindfulness-based therapy) and control group. The research tool 
      included Ryff's psychological well-being scale (Ryff, 1989). The experimental 
      group was subjected to training on mindfulness-based therapy (Baer et al., 2006) 
      during eight 90-min sessions. However, the control group did not receive any 
      intervention. RESULT: After running the intervention, a significant difference 
      was seen between the components of autonomy, personal growth, purpose in life, 
      self-acceptance, positive relationship with others, and psychological well-being 
      after running the educational intervention between the experimental and control 
      groups (P < 0.05), while no meaningful difference popped up between the 
      experimental and control groups in terms of environmental mastery as one of the 
      aspects measured in psychological well-being scale after the educational 
      intervention (P = 0.602). CONCLUSION: According to the results, it seems that 
      psychologists can benefit from the method of training on mindfulness-based 
      therapy in order to increase the psychological well-being of women as the heads 
      of households.

TI  - Only Small Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Biomarker Levels of

      Meta-Analyses.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have a positive effect on biomarkers of 
      inflammation and stress in patients with psychiatric disorders and physical 
      illnesses. Regarding subclinical populations, results are less clear. The present 
      meta-analysis addressed the effects of MBIs on biomarkers in psychiatric 
      populations and among healthy, stressed, and at-risk populations. All available 
      biomarker data were investigated with a comprehensive approach, using two 
      three-level meta-analyses. Pre-post changes in biomarker levels within treatment 
      groups (k = 40 studies, total N = 1441) and treatment effects compared to control 
      group effects, using only RCT data (k = 32, total N = 2880), were of similar 
      magnitude, Hedges g = -0.15 (95% CI = [-0.23, -0.06], p < 0.001) and g = -0.11 
      (95% CI = [-0.23, 0.001], p = 0.053). Effects increased in magnitude when 
      including available follow-up data but did not differ between type of sample, 
      MBI, biomarker, and control group or duration of the MBI. This suggests that MBIs 
      may ameliorate biomarker levels in both psychiatric and subclinical populations 
      to a small extent. However, low study quality and evidence of publication bias 
      may have impacted on the results. More large and preregistered studies are still 
      needed in this field of research.

TI  - A brief mindfulness-based intervention for stress, pain, emotion and attention 
      regulation in military service members with mild traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 1876-1900
LID - 10.1002/jclp.23699 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The primary aim of this study was to conduct an open pilot clinical trial of 
      a brief mindfulness-based intervention for persistent postconcussion symptoms 
      that occur after mild traumatic brain injury in military service members. For 
      many service members, operational tempo and other time constraints may prevent 
      them from completing a standard mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Thus, 
      this study sought to examine the effectiveness of a five-session intervention 
      called mindfulness-based stress, pain, emotion, and attention regulation 
      (MSPEAR). METHODS: Participants were active duty service members with a history 
      of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and persisting postconcussion symptoms, all 
      of whom were recruited from an outpatient TBI rehabilitation program at a 
      military treatment facility. Of the 38 service members that were initially 
      enrolled, 25 completed the 5-session MSPEAR intervention, and 20 returned for a 
      5-week follow-up evaluation. Questionnaires assessing perceived stress, positive 
      affect, pain interference and catastrophizing, sleep disturbances, perceived 
      behavioral and attention regulation, self-efficacy and satisfaction with life 
      were administered at preintervention, postintervention, and at 5-week follow-up 
      intervals. Neuropsychological testing at preintervention and 5-week follow-up 
      included performance validity measures, attention, working memory, and executive 
      function measures. T-tests were run to compare for questionnaire measures at 
      preintervention (Time 1) to postintervention (Time 2). Repeated analysis of 
      variances were conducted to compare questionnaire and neuropsychological measures 
      at Time 1, Time 2, and at Time 3 which is the 5-week follow-up. RESULTS: 
      Improvements in perceived stress, positive affect, behavioral regulation, 
      metacognition, sleep disturbance, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life were 
      found immediately after the MSPEAR intervention and were maintained at the 5-week 
      follow-up. Magnification and helplessness aspects of pain catastrophizing 
      improved when comparing preintervention to the 5-week follow-up. Pain 
      interference was not significantly different across study assessment times. 
      Neuropsychological testing revealed improvements in sustained attention, working 
      memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control when comparing 
      preintervention to the 5-week follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The MSPEAR 
      intervention appears to show promise as a brief and effective therapy for 
      specific postconcussion symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury in military 
      service members. Each of the components of MSPEAR including stress, pain 
      catastrophizing, emotion and attention regulation showed improvements in this 
      study, and bears further investigation in a larger scale, preferably randomized 
      controlled trial in those active duty military service members who experience 
      persisting symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury.

TI  - Who benefits from mindfulness? The moderating role of personality and social 
      norms for the effectiveness on psychological and physiological outcomes among 
      police officers.
PG  - 99-112
LID - 10.1037/ocp0000159 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing interest to use mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for 
      occupational health promotion. As most evidence for the beneficial effects comes 
      from convenience samples in the social/education/health sector, it is still an 
      open question if MBIs are effective in other contexts, or for whom MBIs are more 
      effective. In addition, self-selection and sample characteristics may have biased 
      previous findings. Theoretically and practically, it is important to know whether 
      MBIs are also effective for nonselective samples outside the social and health 
      sector, especially in agentic and male-oriented cultures. Therefore, this study 
      investigates the effects of a MBI on physiological and psychological criteria in 
      a nonselective sample of police officers. Moreover, this study examines whether 
      effectiveness depends on participants' personality (neuroticism, openness, and 
      conscientiousness) and on perceived social norms toward MBIs. Using a pre-post 
      intervention design, N = 267 police officers were randomly assigned to an 
      intervention group receiving a 6-week intervention and to a control group. 
      Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a positive effect on heart rate 
      variability and a stronger reduction of psychological strain, health complaints, 
      and negative affect, as well as more improvement of mindfulness and self-care in 
      the intervention group in comparison with the control group. Additionally, 
      participants higher in neuroticism and openness benefitted more, and the 
      effectiveness was stronger for those who perceived a favorable social norm toward 
      MBIs. Our findings provide evidence that participants with male-oriented 
      occupations may also benefit from a MBI. The importance of individual differences 
      and the social context is discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

TI  - The impact of Tai Chi and mind-body breathing in COPD: Insights from a 
      qualitative sub-study of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e0249263

LID - e0249263
AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with multiple 
      psychosocial and behavioral factors. Prior research suggests that mind-body 
      interventions may support the development and maintenance of healthy behaviors 
      and improve health-related quality-of-life in such patients. We sought to 
      qualitatively explore cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral changes in patients 
      with COPD who participated in two different mind-body interventions compared to 
      an education control. METHODS: We analyzed semi-structured qualitative exit 
      interviews from a prospective, randomized pilot trial (N = 123) investigating 
      12-weeks of Tai Chi (TC) vs. mind-body breathing (MBB) vs. education (EDU) 
      control in patients with moderate-severe COPD. TC involved traditional movements, 
      that integrate meditative breathing, while MBB focused mainly on meditative 
      breathing techniques alone. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed 
      verbatim. Qualitative analysis of randomly selected transcripts was performed by 
      two independent reviewers using an iterative process to identify emergent themes 
      informed by grounded theory methods until thematic saturation was reached. 
      RESULTS: A total of 66 transcripts were reviewed (N = 22 TC, N = 22 MBB, N = 22 
      EDU). Participants were mean age = 68.1 years, GOLD Stage = 2.3, baseline FEV11 
      percent predicted mean (SD): 58% (13.4), 42.4% female. We identified six 
      frequently mentioned themes: 1) overall awareness and understanding, 2) self-care 
      knowledge, skills and behaviors, 3) behavior-related neurocognitive concepts, 4) 
      physical function, 5) psychological well-being, and 6) social support/social 
      function. Compared to EDU, more participants in TC and MBB noted improvements in 
      awareness of self and the mind-body connection (e.g., body and breath awareness), 
      knowledge of breathing techniques and integration of self-care skills with daily 
      activities, self-efficacy for symptom management (particularly managing anxiety 
      and dyspnea), acceptance of disease, physical function improvements (e.g., 
      endurance, dyspnea, fatigue), and psychological well-being (particularly 
      relaxation, emotion regulation and decreased reactivity). Compared to MBB, those 
      in TC shared more intention to continue with self-care behaviors, physical 
      activity self-efficacy, and improved flexibility. All three groups, including 
      EDU, noted increased social support and knowledge of disease. Those in EDU, 
      however, had fewer mentions of processes related to behavior change, and less 
      concrete changes in neurocognitive, psychological, and physical function domains. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body interventions including meditative breathing may impact 
      behavior-related neurocognitive and emotional factors that improve self-care 
      management and support positive behavioral changes in patients with COPD. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This trial is registered in Clinical Trials.gov, ID number 
      NCT01551953.

AB  - Older adults often avoid seeking psychological treatment, thus challenging their 
      ability to cope effectively with anxiety, stress, and depression. The current 
      study aimed to compare the effects of a mindfulness intervention with cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) on measures of emotional distress and attitudes toward 
      seeking mental health treatment among older adults. Twenty-four seniors were 
      assigned to three groups: (1) Mindfulness-based intervention for seniors (MBIS), 
      (2) CBT for anxiety, or (3) a care-as-usual control group. Participants in the 
      two intervention groups of eight weekly sessions were randomly assigned. Results 
      showed that attitudes toward seeking psychological treatment and depression, 
      anxiety, and worry levels were evaluated before and after the interventions. 
      Following both interventions, participants considered the prospect of utilizing 
      psychological treatment more positively, whereas no changes were observed in the 
      control group. Interestingly, worry levels were eased only in the MBIS group, and 
      anxiety levels were eased only in the CBT group. Our findings support the 
      understanding that cognitive group interventions can effectively achieve their 
      intended aim (decreasing worry or anxiety) and positively impact attitudes toward 
      psychological treatment.Trial registration: clinicaltrials, NCT04165005,

AB  - Despite emerging evidence suggesting positive outcomes of mindfulness training 
      for the self-management of other neurodegenerative diseases, limited research has 
      explored its effect on the self-management of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed 
      to characterize the experiences of individuals participating in a facilitated, 
      group mindfulness-based lifestyle program for community living adults with Stage 
      2 PD and explore how the program influenced beliefs about self-management of 
      their disease. Our longitudinal qualitative study was embedded within a 
      randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a 6-week mindfulness-based 
      lifestyle program on patient-reported function. The study was set in Melbourne, 
      Australia in 2012-2013. We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants 
      before, immediately after, and 6 months following participation in the program. 
      Sixteen participants were interviewed prior to commencing the program. Of these, 
      12 were interviewed shortly after its conclusion, and 9 interviewed at 6 months. 
      Prior to the program, participants felt a lack of control over their illness. A 
      desire for control and a need for alternative tools for managing the progression 
      of PD motivated many to engage with the program. Following the program, where 
      participants experienced an increase in mindfulness, many became more accepting 
      of disease progression and reported improved social relationships and 
      self-confidence in managing their disease. Mindfulness-based lifestyle programs 
      have the potential for increasing both participants' sense of control over their 
      reactions to disease symptoms as well as social connectedness. Community-based 
      mindfulness training may provide participants with tools for self-managing a 
      number of the consequences of Stage 2 PD.

TI  - Effectiveness of a nurse-led mindfulness stress-reduction intervention on 
      diabetes distress, diabetes self-management, and HbA1c levels among people with 
      type 2 diabetes: A pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 46-58
LID - 10.1002/nur.22195 [doi]
AB  - People with diabetes frequently have elevated diabetes distress. Although 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapy has been shown effective in 
      reducing diabetes distress, it has only been delivered by psychologists or a 
      multidisciplinary team with an attrition rate of up to 39%, which limits its 
      dissemination to a broader audience. This study was aimed to pilot evaluate the 
      feasibility of a nurse-led MBSR therapy and explore its potential efficacy 
      amongst people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 100 participants were 
      randomly allocated either to the intervention group (nurse-led MBSR 
      therapy + regular diabetes education) or the control group (regular diabetes 
      education). Data on diabetes distress, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes 
      self-management were collected at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks. Hemoglobin 
      A1c (HbA1c) was collected at baseline and 12 weeks. A generalized estimating 
      equation analysis for repeated measures was used to determine intervention and 
      time effects. As predicted, the nurse-led MBSR therapy had a significant 
      time-by-group interaction effect on diabetes distress total score (95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 0.58-0.77, p < 0.001), diabetes self-efficacy (95% CI: -0.93 to 
      -0.74, p < 0.001), diabetes self-management (95% CI: -10.80 to -7.83, p < 0.001), 
      and HbA1c levels (95% CI: 0.04-1.14, p = 0.03) in the intervention group compared 
      with the control group over 12 weeks. This is the first nurse-led MBSR therapy in 
      a hospital setting that is feasible and has the potential to improve health 
      outcomes. This approach may offer an innovative model to deliver MBSR therapy. A 
      randomized controlled trial comparing the nurse-led MBSR plus usual diabetes 
      education with usual diabetes education along with a mechanism to equalize 
      intervention attention between the groups is indicated.

TI  - Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on quality of life in nursing home 
      residents: a feasibility study.
PG  - 74-81
LID - 10.1159/000121479 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With demographic change, the number of elderly people is increasing. 
      The aging process and associated stress diminishes their quality of life. 
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been claimed to reduce stress and 
      alleviate suffering. It might be a useful approach to improve the condition in 
      the elderly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine feasibility and potential effects 
      of MBSR on nursing home residents in Germany, a non-randomized feasibility study 
      was conducted including 22 participants; 15 of them participated in an 8-week 
      MBSR course, 7 served as untreated comparison group. Health-related quality of 
      life (SF-12), depressive symptoms (GDS-12R), cognitive impairment (MMST), 
      activities of daily living (Barthel Index), satisfaction with life, physical pain 
      and major complaints were assessed pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: 9 out of 
      15 course participants completed the course (60%). They showed a significant 
      increase in the SF-12 physical health score (p = 0.017). Depressive symptoms 
      (GDS-12R) significantly declined within the meditation group (p = 0.04) and as 
      compared to the untreated group (p = 0.011). In the comparison group, a 
      significant decrease in major complaints (p = 0.011) and an increase in the SF-12 
      mental health score were found. The meditation group yielded positive changes in 
      the SF-12 mental health score, in satisfaction with life and in pain intensity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In view of the setting, the completion rate of 60% appears to be 
      acceptable. Significant results suggest that MBSR may help improve health-related 
      quality of life and reduce symptoms of depression. Yet, as participants did not 
      meet the requirement to practice independently, feasibility of conducting MBSR 
      with elderly who live in a nursing home has to be questioned.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stress negatively impacts upon physical and mental health. Pharmacy 
      students demonstrate higher stress than the general population. Mindfulness may 
      improve pharmacy students' stress and distress levels. The purpose of this study 
      was to assess the quantitative effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on 
      pharmacy student stress, distress, burnout, and mindfulness levels. METHODS: A 
      quasi-randomised controlled trial was conducted at an Irish pharmacy school 
      during the 2016 to 2017 academic year. The intervention group completed a 
      four-week mindfulness course. The waitlist control group received only usual 
      education. Participants completed a demographics form, the Perceived Stress 
      Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Student 
      Survey, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire at baseline and immediately 
      post-intervention. RESULTS: Full data were gathered and analysed for 99 students 
      (51 intervention, 48 control, 66.7% female). There were no significant 
      differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline. 
      Post-intervention, a large effect on mental distress was found (Partial Eta 
      Squared 0.137) with the intervention group reporting statistically significantly 
      lower distress than the control group (F (1,98) = 15.3, p < 0.005). Stress and 
      distress were significantly improved for females (p = 0.026, p < 0.005), while 
      males improved in the observing facet of mindfulness (p = 0.038). There was a 
      positive association between attendance and these findings (r2 = 0.191, 
      p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Female pharmacy students experienced improvements in 
      mental distress and stress after participation in the intervention. Mindfulness 
      may have a future role to play in pharmacy and healthcare education.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to reduce 
      subjective symptoms of insomnia but the effects on objective measures remain 
      unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine sleep EEG microarchitecture 
      patterns from a randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
      (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI). METHODS: Sleep EEG 
      spectral analysis was conducted on 36 participants with chronic insomnia 
      (>6 months) randomized to 8-week MBSR, MBTI, or self-monitoring control (SM). 
      Overnight polysomnography with 6-channel EEG was conducted at baseline, 
      post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Spectral power averaged from channels 
      C3/C4 across NREM epochs (excluding N1) was examined for within-group changes and 
      relationships with self-report measures. RESULTS: Increases in absolute NREM beta 
      (16-25 Hz) power were observed from baseline to post-treatment (p = .02, 
      d = 0.53) and maintained at 6-month follow-up (p = .01, d = 0.57) in the combined 
      MBI groups, and additionally in the gamma (25-40 Hz) range at follow-up for the 
      MBTI group only. No significant changes in these frequency bands were observed 
      for SM. Following mindfulness intervention, NREM beta was positively associated 
      with Five-Facet Mindfulness (FFM) score (rho = 0.37, p = .091) and negatively 
      associated with Insomnia Severity Index (rho = -0.43, p = .047). CONCLUSION: 
      These results in people with insomnia corroborate prior reports of increased 
      high-frequency sleep EEG power associated with mindfulness training. This change 
      in beta EEG pattern merits further evaluation as a potential marker of the 
      effects of mindfulness meditation on sleep, especially given the paradoxical 
      findings in the context of insomnia. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Embedded within a randomized efficacy trial, the present study aimed 
      to investigate whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for recurrent 
      depression improved symptoms of insomnia. METHODS: Sixty-eight remitted 
      participants with at least three prior episodes of depression were randomized to 
      8 weeks of MBCT (n = 33) or a waitlist control condition (n = 35). The Bergen 
      Insomnia Scale was used to screen for insomnia symptoms before and after the 
      intervention. The analyses were conducted using one-way between-groups analyses 
      of covariance. RESULTS: Twenty-five MBCT participants and 30 waitlist controls 
      completed the study (74.5% females; mean age 40.7 ± 12.9 years). At baseline, 
      83.6% screened positive for the insomnia diagnosis. Following the intervention 
      and after controlling for corresponding insomnia parameters at baseline, MBCT 
      completers reported significantly less severe insomnia symptoms (p = 0.017), as 
      well as less problems with prolonged sleep onset (p = 0.047) and nocturnal 
      awakenings (p = 0.023), relative to controls. No group differences were found on 
      early morning awakening, daytime impairment, or dissatisfaction with sleep. 
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that MBCT improves certain insomnia symptoms. 
      However, additional sleep-specific interventions may be needed to further improve 
      this population's sleep.Clinical Trial Registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN18001392,

TI  - Zoom-Based Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Plus Just-in-Time 
      Mindfulness Practice Triggered by Wearable Sensors for Opioid Craving and Chronic 
      Pain.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s12671-023-02137-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The opioid crisis in the USA remains severe during the COVID-19 
      pandemic, which has reduced access to evidence-based interventions. This Stage 1 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed the preliminary efficacy of Zoom-based 
      Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) plus Just-in-Time Adaptive 
      Intervention (JITAI) prompts to practice mindfulness triggered by wearable 
      sensors (MORE + JITAI). METHOD: Opioid-treated chronic pain patients (n = 63) 
      were randomized to MORE + JITAI or a Zoom-based supportive group (SG) 
      psychotherapy control. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments 
      (EMA) of craving and pain (co-primary outcomes), as well as positive affect, and 
      stress at one random probe per day for 90 days. EMA probes were also triggered 
      when a wearable sensor detected the presence of physiological stress, as 
      indicated by changes in heart rate variability (HRV), at which time participants 
      in MORE + JITAI were prompted by an app to engage in audio-guided mindfulness 
      practice. RESULTS: EMA showed significantly greater reductions in craving, pain, 
      and stress, and increased positive affect over time for participants in 
      MORE + JITAI than for participants in SG. JITAI-initiated mindfulness practice 
      was associated with significant improvements in these variables, as well as 
      increases in HRV. Machine learning predicted JITAI-initiated mindfulness practice 
      effectiveness with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      pilot trial, MORE + JITAI demonstrated preliminary efficacy for reducing opioid 
      craving and pain, two factors implicated in opioid misuse. MORE + JITAI is a 
      promising intervention that warrants investigation in a fully powered RCT.

TI  - Coping After Breast Cancer: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of Stress 
      Management eHealth Interventions.
PG  - e47195
LID - 10.2196/47195 [doi]
LID - e47195
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-third or more of breast cancer survivors report stress and other 
      psychological and physical complaints that can negatively impact their quality of 
      life. Psychosocial stress management interventions, shown to mitigate the 
      negative impact of these complaints, can now be delivered as accessible and 
      convenient (for the patient and provider) eHealth interventions. In this 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), Coping After Breast Cancer (CABC), 2 modified 
      versions of the stress management eHealth intervention program StressProffen were 
      created: one with predominantly cognitive behavioral stress management content 
      (StressProffen-cognitive behavioral therapy intervention [StressProffen-CBI]) and 
      another with predominantly mindfulness-based stress management content 
      (StressProffen-mindfulness-based intervention [StressProffen-MBI]). OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aims to investigate the effects in breast cancer survivors of using 
      StressProffen-CBI and StressProffen-MBI compared with a control group (treatment 
      as usual). METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I-III, 
      unequivocally human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen 
      receptor-negative tumors) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) aged 21-69 years who 
      completed the Cancer Registry of Norway-initiated health survey on quality of 
      life are invited to the CABC trial about 7 months after diagnosis. Women who give 
      consent to participate are randomized (1:1:1) to either the StressProffen-CBI, 
      StressProffen-MBI, or control group. Both StressProffen interventions consist of 
      10 modules of stress management content delivered through text, sound, video, and 
      images. The primary outcome is between-group changes in perceived stress at 6 
      months, assessed with Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. The secondary 
      outcomes comprise changes in quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue, 
      sleep, neuropathy, coping, mindfulness, and work-related outcomes approximately 
      1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis. Long-term effects of the interventions on work 
      participation, comorbidities, relapse or new cancers, and mortality will be 
      assessed using data from national health registries. RESULTS: Recruitment is 
      scheduled from January 2021 to May 2023. The goal is to recruit 430 participants 
      (100 in each group). As of April 14 2023, 428 participants have been enrolled. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The CABC trial is possibly the largest ongoing psychosocial eHealth 
      RCT in patients with breast cancer. If 1 or both interventions prove to be 
      effective in reducing stress and improving psychosocial and physical complains, 
      the StressProffen eHealth interventions could be beneficial, inexpensive, and 
      easily implementable tools for breast cancer survivors when coping with late 
      effects after cancer and cancer treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effect of the Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Anxiety and Depression 
      Status of COVID-19 Patients Treated in Fangcang Hospitals: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2735-2745
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S414553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the focal point of epidemic prevention and control, the mental 
      health of COVID-19 patients cannot be ignored. Online Mindfulness-Based Stress 
      Reduction (MBSR) allows for the provision of conveniently accessible, effective 
      and low-cost interventions on a large scale. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness 
      of an online MBSR intervention in alleviating anxiety and depression among 
      asymptomatic/mild patients limited by COVID-19-related restrictions. METHODS: 
      Fifty-eight patients treated in Sanya Fangcang hospital were randomly allocated 
      to either to the experimental group (n = 29) following daily, for 5 days, an 
      online-based mindfulness intervention or to the control group (n = 29). Patients 
      from both groups underwent online questionnaires including assessment of anxiety 
      and depression status at pre- and post-tests using Self-rating Anxiety Scale and 
      Self-Rating Depression Scale. RESULTS: After the online-based MBSR program, the 
      anxiety and depression scores of the patients in the MBSR group decreased 
      significantly in comparison to the scores of those in the control group 
      (respectively η(2) = 0.175, η(2) = 0.215, p < 0.001). And the proportion of 
      severe anxiety and depression patients in the MBSR group decreased to 0% which 
      lower than the control group, and the proportion of light anxiety and depression 
      patients was significantly more than that in the control group after the MBSR 
      intervention. CONCLUSION: The online-based MBSR intervention appears to be an 
      effective way of alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms among COVID-19 
      patients with associated quarantine in Fangcang hospital. Given the seriousness 
      of mental health threat that could be posed by this ongoing pandemic, our study 
      provides a new idea and method for cost-effective and time-efficient 
      interventions in the future of epidemic prevention and control.

TI  - Philosophy for children and mindfulness during COVID-19: Results from a 
      randomized cluster trial and impact on mental health in elementary school 
      students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a 
      negative impact on children's mental health. Given these problems can have 
      significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative 
      repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy 
      for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in 
      this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact 
      of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the 
      impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and 
      inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction 
      (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on 
      mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the 
      P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than 
      participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN 
      were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN 
      satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: 
      Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 
      pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be 
      helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy 
      BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school 
      students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is 
      warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and 
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in 
      elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not 
      anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 
      school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the 
      current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological 
      support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which 
      has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on 
      youth mental health.

      clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Around 40-50% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
      suffer from obsessions and compulsions after receiving first-line treatments. 
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been proposed as a reasonable 
      augmentation strategy for OCD. MBCT trains to decentre from distressful thoughts 
      and emotions by focusing on them voluntarily and with consciousness. This 
      practice develops alternative ways to deal with obsessions, which could increase 
      non-reactivity behaviours and, in turn, reduce compulsions. This study aims to 
      investigate the efficacy of MBCT to improve OCD symptoms. Secondly, it pursues to 
      investigate which socio-demographic, clinical, and neurobiological 
      characteristics mediate or moderate the MBCT response; and identify potential 
      biomarkers of positive/negative response. METHODS: This study is a randomised 
      clinical trial (RCT) of 60 OCD patients who do not respond to first-line 
      treatments. Participants will be randomised to either an MBCT program or 
      treatment as usual. The MBCT group will undergo 10 weekly sessions of 120min. 
      Principal outcome: change in OCD severity symptoms using clinician and 
      self-reported measures. Also, participants will undergo a comprehensive 
      evaluation assessing comorbid clinical variables, neuropsychological functioning 
      and thought content. Finally, a comprehensive neuroimaging protocol using 
      structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging will be acquired in a 3T 
      scanner. All data will be obtained at baseline and post-intervention. DISCUSSION: 
      This study will assess the efficacy of mindfulness in OCD patients who do not 
      achieve clinical recovery after usual treatment. It is the first RCT in this 
      subject examining clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging variables to 
      examine the neural patterns associated with the MBCT response. CLINICAL TRIALS 
      REGISTRATION: NCT03128749.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Pilot Intervention Study of a Mindfulness-Based 
      Self-Leadership Training (MBSLT) on Stress and Performance.
PG  - 1393-1407
LID - 10.1007/s12671-017-0715-0 [doi]
AB  - The present randomized pilot intervention study examines the effects of a 
      mindfulness-based self-leadership training (MBSLT) specifically developed for 
      academic achievement situations. Both mindfulness and self-leadership have a 
      strong self-regulatory focus and are helpful in terms of stress resilience and 
      performance enhancements. Based on several theoretical points of contact and a 
      specific interplay between mindfulness and self-leadership, the authors developed 
      an innovative intervention program that improves mood as well as performance in a 
      real academic setting. The intervention was conducted as a randomized controlled 
      study over 10 weeks. The purpose was to analyze the effects on perceived stress, 
      test anxiety, academic self-efficacy, and the performance of students by 
      comparing an intervention and control group (n = 109). Findings demonstrated 
      significant effects on mindfulness, self-leadership, academic self-efficacy, and 
      academic performance improvements in the intervention group. Results showed that 
      the intervention group reached significantly better grade point averages than the 
      control group. Moreover, the MBSLT over time led to a reduction of test anxiety 
      in the intervention group compared to the control group. Furthermore, while 
      participants of the control group showed an increase in stress over time, 
      participants of the intervention group maintained constant stress levels over 
      time. The combination of mindfulness and self-leadership addressed both positive 
      effects on moods and on objective academic performance. The effects demonstrate 
      the great potential of combining mindfulness with self-leadership to develop a 
      healthy self-regulatory way of attaining achievement-related goals and succeeding 
      in high-stress academic environments.

TI  - Qigong intervention for breast cancer survivors with complaints of decreased

PG  - 1395-1403
LID - 10.1007/s00520-018-4430-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an 
      8-week Qigong intervention to improve objectively and subjectively assessed 
      cognitive function in breast cancer survivors who were 2 months to 8 years post 
      completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. METHODS: A randomized, 
      single-blind, three-arm intervention pilot was conducted to compare Qigong to 
      gentle exercise and survivorship support. Feasibility was measured by 
      recruitment, group session attendance, and adherence to home practice for the two 
      exercise groups. Changes in self-report and objectively measured cognitive 
      function were compared between the three groups from baseline (T1) to completion 
      of the intervention (T2) and 4 weeks post intervention (T3). RESULTS: Fifty 
      participants consented (83% of desired sample) with an overall attrition rate of 
      28%. Attrition was highest for the gentle exercise group (50%). Group attendance 
      adherence ranged from 44 to 67%. The a priori established rate of 75% weekly 
      attendance was not achieved, nor was the goal of 75% adherence to home practice 
      for the two exercise groups (7 to 41%). Self-report of cognitive function 
      improved most for the Qigong group (p = .01). Improvement was demonstrated for 
      the Trail Making A (gentle exercise, p = .007) and F-A-S verbal fluency (support 
      group, p = .02) tests. Qigong participants reported the most reduction of 
      distress (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that mindfulness-based 
      exercise may be superior to gentle exercise alone or survivorship support for 
      improving self-report of cognitive function and distress after treatment for 
      breast cancer. The mindfulness component may enhance the positive impact of 
      exercise on cognitive function.

TI  - Effects of 4-week mindfulness training versus adaptive cognitive training on 
      processing speed and working memory in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 591-604
LID - 10.1037/neu0000633 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this preregistered, secondary analysis of a pilot 
      randomized controlled trial (NCT02717429) was to compare the impact of 4-week 
      mindfulness-based training and adaptive cognitive training, with a waitlist 
      control condition, on processing speed and working memory in people with multiple 
      sclerosis (PwMS). METHOD: Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to mindfulness-based 
      training (MBT), adaptive computerized cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist 
      (WL) control group and completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of 
      Neuropsychological Tests at pre- and posttraining. Training-related changes on 
      the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition 
      Test (PASAT) were the primary outcomes of interest. Baseline cognitive status was 
      examined as a moderator of treatment gains. Practice time, change in aCT game 
      difficulty, and rate of change in state awareness across MBT were assessed as 
      correlates of cognitive gains. FINDINGS: Compared with aCT and WL, mindfulness 
      training significantly improved processing speed (η(p)² = .14). Baseline 
      cognitive status did not moderate change in processing speed (η(p)² = .005) or 
      working memory (η(p)² = .014). Practice time and change in game difficulty were 
      not significantly correlated with cognitive gains (all ps > .49). In the MBT 
      group, rate of change in awareness was significantly associated with improvement 
      in working memory (ρ = .52, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: In PwMS, 4 weeks of 
      mindfulness meditation training improved processing speed above and beyond aCT 
      and WL. More rapid change in awareness during mindfulness training may be 
      associated with greater gains in working memory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has its origins in an Eastern Buddhist tradition that is 
      over 2500 years old and can be defined as a specific form of attention that is 
      non-judgmental, purposeful, and focused on the present moment. It has been well 
      established in cognitive-behavior therapy in the last decades, while it has been 
      investigated in manualized group settings such as mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. However, there is scarce 
      research evidence on the effects of mindfulness as a treatment element in 
      individual therapy. Consequently, the demand to investigate mindfulness under 
      effectiveness conditions in trainee therapists has been highlighted. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: To fill in this research gap, we designed the PrOMET Study. In 
      our study, we will investigate the effects of brief, audiotape-presented, 
      session-introducing interventions with mindfulness elements conducted by trainee 
      therapists and their patients at the beginning of individual therapy sessions in 
      a prospective, randomized, controlled design under naturalistic conditions with a 
      total of 30 trainee therapists and 150 patients with depression and anxiety 
      disorders in a large outpatient training center. We hypothesize that the primary 
      outcomes of the session-introducing intervention with mindfulness elements will 
      be positive effects on therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) and 
      general clinical symptomatology (Brief Symptom Checklist) in contrast to the 
      session-introducing progressive muscle relaxation and treatment-as-usual control 
      conditions. Treatment duration is 25 therapy sessions. Therapeutic alliance will 
      be assessed on a session-to-session basis. Clinical symptomatology will be 
      assessed at baseline, session 5, 15 and 25. We will conduct multilevel modeling 
      to address the nested data structure. The secondary outcome measures include 
      depression, anxiety, interpersonal functioning, mindful awareness, and 
      mindfulness during the sessions. DISCUSSION: The study results could provide 
      important practical implications because they could inform ideas on how to 
      improve the clinical training of psychotherapists that could be implemented very 
      easily; this is because there is no need for complex infrastructures or 
      additional time concerning these brief session-introducing interventions with 
      mindfulness elements that are directly implemented in the treatment sessions.

TI  - The effectiveness of a school mindfulness-based intervention on the neural 
      correlates of inhibitory control in children at risk: A randomized control trial.
PG  - e13403
LID - 10.1111/desc.13403 [doi]
AB  - Interest in the applications of mindfulness practice in education is growing in 
      the scientific community. Recent research has shown that mindfulness practice in 
      schools may be beneficial for executive functions (EFs) which are abilities 
      crucial for healthy development. The study of the effects of mindfulness 
      practices on children's neural correlates of EFs, particularly inhibitory 
      control, may provide relevant information about the impact and mechanisms of 
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in children. The aim of the present study 
      was to investigate the effects of a MBI in elementary school children on the 
      neural correlates of inhibitory control via a randomized controlled trial. 
      Children from two 4th grade classrooms and two 5th grade classrooms located in a 
      school identified as having low socioeconomic status in Santiago de Chile were 
      randomly assigned to either receive a MBI or serve as active controls and receive 
      a social skills program. Both before and after the interventions, 
      electroencephalographic activity was recorded during a modified version of the 
      Go/Nogo task in a subsample of children in each group. Additionally, teachers 
      completed questionnaires of students' EFs and students completed self-report 
      measures. Results revealed increases in EFs assessed by questionnaires together 
      with improved P3 amplitude associated with successful response inhibition in 
      children who received the MBI compared to active controls. These results 
      contribute to the understanding of the ways in which mindfulness practices can 
      promote the development of inhibitory control together with EF improvement, 
      factors identified as critical for children's social and emotional development 
      and positive mental health. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: This study investigated the 
      effects of a mindfulness-based intervention in children from a low socioeconomic 
      status school on neural correlates of EFs. Children performed a Go/Nogo task 
      while electroencephalographic activity was recorded and completed questionnaires 
      before and after a MBI or an active control program. Improvements in EFs assessed 
      by questionnaires together with an increased Nogo-P3 activity associated with 
      successful inhibition in children who received the MBI were found. The results 
      could contribute to understand how mindfulness practice can promote the 
      development of inhibitory control in children from vulnerable populations.

TI  - Impact of a contemplative end-of-life training program: being with dying.
PG  - 405-14
LID - 10.1017/S1478951509990411 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health care professionals report a lack of skills in the psychosocial 
      and spiritual aspects of caring for dying people and high levels of moral 
      distress, grief, and burnout. To address these concerns, the "Being with Dying: 
      Professional Training Program in Contemplative End-of-Life Care" (BWD) was 
      created. The premise of BWD, which is based on the development of mindfulness and 
      receptive attention through contemplative practice, is that cultivating stability 
      of mind and emotions enables clinicians to respond to others and themselves with 
      compassion. This article describes the impact of BWD on the participants. 
      METHODS: Ninety-five BWD participants completed an anonymous online survey; 40 
      completed a confidential open-ended telephone interview. RESULTS: Four main 
      themes-the power of presence, cultivating balanced compassion, recognizing grief, 
      and the importance of self-care-emerged in the interviews and were supported in 
      the survey data. The interviewees considered BWD's contemplative and reflective 
      practices meaningful, useful, and valuable and reported that BWD provided skills, 
      attitudes, behaviors, and tools to change how they worked with the dying and 
      bereaved. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The quality of presence has the potential to 
      transform the care of dying people and the caregivers themselves. Cultivating 
      this quality within themselves and others allows clinicians to explore 
      alternatives to exclusively intellectual, procedural, and task-oriented 
      approaches when caring for dying people. BWD provides a rare opportunity to 
      engage in practices and methods that cultivate the stability of mind and emotions 
      that may facilitate compassionate care of dying patients, families, and 
      caregivers.

AB  - Despite some evidence of the benefits of self-compassion training among socially 
      anxious individuals, little is known about whether enhancing self-compassion 
      prior to exposure therapy increases initial exposure engagement. Additionally, 
      manipulations have relied on broad definitions of self-compassion, rendering it 
      difficult to distinguish the impact of individual components. This study employed 
      three experiential exercises designed to enhance one facet of 
      self-compassion-common humanity. Socially anxious undergraduates (N = 63) were 
      randomized in groups to 1) common humanity-enhanced exposure (n = 32) or 2) 
      exposure alone (n = 31). In the common humanity condition, participants wrote 
      self-compassionately, shared fears, and completed a common humanity-focused 
      lovingkindness meditation. All participants then completed a speech exposure in 
      front of live judges followed by an optional second exposure. Within the common 
      humanity condition, positive self-responding to the speech exposure increased 
      (b = 0.30, p = .026). Common humanity participants also remained in the first 
      exposure longer, relative to exposure alone (b = -30.92, p = .002). Participants 
      rated exercises as at least moderately helpful, with sharing fears rated most 
      helpful. In sum, a brief group-based multi-modal common humanity induction 
      represents a promising approach to improving initial engagement with feared 
      contexts among socially anxious individuals.

LID - 2450
AB  - The present study explored the effects of a second-generation mindfulness-based 
      intervention known as flow meditation (Meditación-Fluir) in the improvement of 
      healthy life behaviors. A sample of university students (n = 51) in Spain were 
      randomly assigned to a seven-week mindfulness treatment or a waiting list control 
      group. Results showed that compared to the control group, individuals in the 
      mindfulness group demonstrated significant improvements across all outcome 
      measures including healthy eating habits (balanced diet, intake rate, snacking 
      between meals, decrease in consumption by negative emotional states, increased 
      consumption by negative emotional states, amount of consumption, meal times, 
      consumption of low-fat products), tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption, and 
      resting habits. There were differences between males and females in some of these 
      variables and a better effect of the treatment was evident in the females of the 
      experimental group when compared to the males. The flow meditation program shows 
      promise for fostering a healthy lifestyle, thus decreasing behaviors related to 
      maladaptive eating, tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption as well as 
      negative rest habits in university students. This mindfulness program could 
      significantly contribute to the treatment of eating disorders and addictions, 
      wherein negative emotional states and impulsivity are central features of the 
      condition.

TI  - A Web-Based Intervention (Germ Defence) to Increase Handwashing During a 
      Pandemic: Process Evaluations of a Randomized Controlled Trial and Public 
      Dissemination.
PG  - e26104
LID - 10.2196/26104 [doi]
LID - e26104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Washing hands helps prevent transmission of seasonal and pandemic 
      respiratory viruses. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) during the swine flu 
      outbreak, participants with access to a fully automated, digital intervention 
      promoting handwashing reported washing their hands more often and experienced 
      fewer respiratory tract infections than those without access to the intervention. 
      Based on these findings, the intervention was adapted, renamed as "Germ Defence," 
      and a study was designed to assess the preliminary dissemination of the 
      intervention to the general public to help prevent the spread of seasonal colds 
      and flu. OBJECTIVE: This study compares the process evaluations of the RCT and 
      Germ Defence dissemination to examine (1) how web-based research enrollment 
      procedures affected those who used the intervention, (2) intervention usage in 
      the 2 contexts, and (3) whether increased intentions to wash hands are replicated 
      once disseminated. METHODS: The RCT ran between 2010 and 2012 recruiting 
      participants offline from general practices, with restricted access to the 
      intervention (N=9155). Germ Defence was disseminated as an open access website 
      for use by the general public from 2016 to 2019 (N=624). The process evaluation 
      plan was developed using Medical Research Council guidance and the framework for 
      Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data. Both interventions contained a 
      goal-setting section where users self-reported current and intended handwashing 
      behavior across 7 situations. RESULTS: During web-based enrolment, 54.3% 
      (17,511/32,250) of the RCT participants dropped out of the study compared to 
      36.5% (358/982) of Germ Defence users. Having reached the start of the 
      intervention, 93.8% (8586/9155) of RCT users completed the core section, whereas 
      65.1% (406/624) of Germ Defence users reached the same point. Users across both 
      studies selected to increase their handwashing in 5 out of 7 situations, 
      including before eating snacks (RCT mean difference 1.040, 95% CI 1.016-1.063; 
      Germ Defence mean difference 0.949, 95% CI 0.766-1.132) and after blowing their 
      nose, sneezing, or coughing (RCT mean difference 0.995, 95% CI 0.972-1.019; Germ 
      Defence mean difference 0.842, 95% CI 0.675-1.008). CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the 
      preliminary dissemination of Germ Defence to the RCT, we were able to examine the 
      potential effects of the research procedures on uptake and attrition such as the 
      sizeable dropout during the RCT enrolment procedure that may have led to a more 
      motivated sample. The Germ Defence study highlighted the points of attrition 
      within the intervention. Despite sample bias in the trial context, the 
      intervention replicated increases in intentions to handwash when used "in the 
      wild." This preliminary dissemination study informed the adaptation of the 
      intervention for the COVID-19 health emergency, and it has now been disseminated 
      globally. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN75058295;

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness interventions 
      have demonstrated improvement in depression, anxiety, and glycemic control. We 
      assessed whether these treatment modalities have shown usefulness in adolescents 
      with T2D or at risk for T2D. RECENT FINDINGS: Data are limited on the use of the 
      abovementioned therapeutic interventions and include only adolescent girls at 
      risk for T2D. CBT was as useful as health education sessions. At 1 year, greater 
      decreases in depression, insulin resistance, and BMI were observed in girls 
      randomized to mindfulness compared with CBT groups. Given the positive outcome of 
      mindfulness intervention in adults and in adolescent girls at risk for T2D, 
      future studies should involve males at risk for T2D, and adolescents diagnosed 
      with T2D. Longer interventions and booster meetings for maintenance should be 
      studied.

      exercise: effects on the self-referential brain network in social anxiety

PG  - 295

LID - 295
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by distorted 
      self-views. The goal of this study was to examine whether mindfulness-based 
      stress reduction (MBSR) alters behavioral and brain measures of negative and 
      positive self-views. METHODS: Fifty-six adult patients with generalized SAD were 
      randomly assigned to MBSR or a comparison aerobic exercise (AE) program. A 
      self-referential encoding task was administered at baseline and post-intervention 
      to examine changes in behavioral and neural responses in the self-referential 
      brain network during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were cued to 
      decide whether positive and negative social trait adjectives were 
      self-descriptive or in upper case font. RESULTS: Behaviorally, compared to AE, 
      MBSR produced greater decreases in negative self-views, and equivalent increases 
      in positive self-views. Neurally, during negative self versus case, compared to 
      AE, MBSR led to increased brain responses in the posterior cingulate cortex 
      (PCC). There were no differential changes for positive self versus case. 
      Secondary analyses showed that changes in endorsement of negative and positive 
      self-views were associated with decreased social anxiety symptom severity for 
      MBSR, but not AE. Additionally, MBSR-related increases in dorsomedial prefrontal 
      cortex (DMPFC) activity during negative self-view versus case were associated 
      with decreased social anxiety related disability and increased mindfulness. 
      Analysis of neural temporal dynamics revealed MBSR-related changes in the timing 
      of neural responses in the DMPFC and PCC for negative self-view versus case. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that MBSR attenuates maladaptive habitual 
      self-views by facilitating automatic (i.e., uninstructed) recruitment of 
      cognitive and attention regulation neural networks. This highlights potentially 
      important links between self-referential and cognitive-attention regulation 
      systems and suggests that MBSR may enhance more adaptive social self-referential 
      processes in patients with SAD.

TI  - Mobile-Delivered Mindfulness Intervention on Anxiety Level Among College 
      Athletes: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e40406
LID - 10.2196/40406 [doi]
LID - e40406
AB  - BACKGROUND: College athletes are a group often affected by anxiety. Few 
      interventional studies have been conducted to address the anxiety issues in this 
      population. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a mobile-delivered mindfulness intervention 
      among college athletes to study its feasibility and efficacy in lowering their 
      anxiety level and improving their mindfulness (measured by the Five Facet 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ]). METHODS: In April 2019, we recruited 290 
      college athletes from a public university in Shanghai, China, and 288 of them 
      were randomized into an intervention group and a control group (closed trial), 
      with the former (n=150) receiving a therapist-guided, smartphone-delivered 
      mindfulness-based intervention and the latter receiving mental health promotion 
      messages (n=138). We offered in-person instructions during the orientation 
      session for the intervention group in a classroom, with the therapist interacting 
      with the participants on the smartphone platform later during the intervention. 
      We used generalized linear modeling and the intent-to-treat approach to compare 
      the 2 groups' outcomes in dispositional anxiety, precompetition anxiety, and 
      anxiety during competition, plus the 5 dimensions of mindfulness (measured by the 
      FFMQ). RESULTS: Our intent-to-treat analysis and generalized linear modeling 
      found no significant difference in dispositional anxiety, precompetition anxiety, 
      or anxiety during competition. Only the "observation" facet of mindfulness 
      measures had a notable difference between the changes experienced by the 2 
      groups, whereby the intervention group had a net gain of .214 yet fell short of 
      reaching statistical significance (P=.09). Participants who specialized in group 
      sports had a higher level of anxiety (β=.19; SE=.08), a lower level of 
      "nonjudgemental inner experience" in FFMQ (β=-.07; SE=.03), and a lower level of 
      "nonreactivity" (β=-.138; SE=.052) than those specializing in individual sports. 
      CONCLUSIONS: No significant reduction in anxiety was detected in this study. 
      Based on the participant feedback, the time availability for mindfulness practice 
      and session attendance for these student athletes in an elite college could have 
      compromised the intervention's effectiveness. Future interventions among this 
      population could explore a more student-friendly time schedule (eg, avoid final 
      exam time) or attempt to improve cognitive and scholastic outcomes. TRIAL

TI  - Effects Of Modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) On The 
      Psychological Health Of Adolescents With Subthreshold Depression: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2695-2704
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S216401 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-threshold depression (SD) has been associated with impairments in 
      adolescent health which increase the rate of major depression. Researchers have 
      shown the effectiveness of mindfulness on mental health, however whether the 
      traditional mindful skills were suitable for youngsters, it was not clear. This 
      study investigated the effects of a tailed Mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      (MBSR) on their psychological state. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized 
      controlled trial was carried out. 56 participants who met the inclusion criteria 
      agreed to be arranged randomly to either the MBSR group (n=28) or the control 
      group (n=28). Participants in MBSR group received a tailored 8-week, one time per 
      week, one hour each time group intervention. The effectiveness of intervention 
      was measured using validated scales, which including BDI-II, MAAS, RRS at three 
      times (T1-before intervention; T2-after intervention; T3-three months after 
      intervention). A repeated-measures analysis of variance model was used to analyze 
      the data. RESULTS: The results showed significant improvements in MBSR group 
      comparing with control group that depression level decreased after the 8-week 
      intervention and the follow up (F =17.721, p < 0.00). At the same time, RRS score 
      was significantly decreased at T2 and T3(F= 28.277, p < 0.00). The results also 
      showed that MBSR promoted the level of mindfulness and the effect persisted for 
      three months after intervention (F=13.489, p < 0.00). CONCLUSION: A tailored MBSR 
      intervention has positive effects on psychology health among SD youngsters, 
      including decrease depression and rumination level, cultivate mindfulness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To mitigate the psychological burdens of COVID-19 for frontline 
      clinicians (FCs), we adapted an existing evidence-based resiliency program, 
      Stress Management and Resilience Training Relaxation Response Program 
      (SMART-3RP), for FCs. This analysis explores moderators of stress coping to 
      determine which subgroups of FCs benefited most from SMART-3RP. METHODS: 102 FCs 
      from Mass General Brigham hospitals engaged in the adapted SMART-3RP. Assessments 
      were completed at group entry (Week 0) and completion (Week 4). The primary 
      outcome was stress coping, and we examined 15 possible baseline moderators. We 
      fit linear mixed effects regression models and assessed potential baseline 
      moderators using a likelihood ratio test. We report model-based estimates and 
      confidence intervals for each moderator-by-time interaction (i.e., differential 
      effect), where positive/negative values indicate more/less improvement in average 
      perceived stress coping. RESULTS: Stress coping improved from Week 0 to Week 4 
      (mean improvement [95% CI] = 0.9 [0.6 to 1.2]). FCs with higher anxiety 
      (differential effect [95% CI] = 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4]), depression (0.4 [0.2 to 0.6]), 
      and loneliness (0.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), but lower levels of mindfulness 
      (CAMS-R(focus): 1.0 [0.4 to 1.6]; CAMS-R(accept): 1.3 [0.7 to 2.0]) and 
      self-compassion (0.4, [0.1 to 0.8]) at baseline experienced greater benefits in 
      perceived stress coping from the SMART-3RP. Baseline health uncertainty along 
      with sociodemographic and work characteristics did not moderate stress coping. 
      DISCUSSION: Results highlight particular sub-populations of FCs that may benefit 
      more from a stress management intervention, especially during emergency responses 
      (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).

TI  - Comparison of a mindful eating intervention to a diabetes self-management 
      intervention among adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 145-54

AB  - Mindful eating may be an effective intervention for increasing awareness of 
      hunger and satiety cues, improving eating regulation and dietary patterns, 
      reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and promoting weight loss. Diabetes 
      self-management education (DSME), which addresses knowledge, self-efficacy, and 
      outcome expectations for improving food choices, also may be an effective 
      intervention for diabetes self-care. Yet few studies have compared the impact of 
      mindful eating to a DSME-based treatment approach on patient outcomes. Adults 35 
      to 65 years old with type 2 diabetes for ≥1 year not requiring insulin therapy 
      were recruited from the community and randomly assigned to treatment group. The 
      impact of a group-based 3-month mindful eating intervention (MB-EAT-D; n = 27) to 
      a group-based 3-month DSME "Smart Choices" (SC) intervention (n = 25) 
      postintervention and at 3-month follow-up was evaluated. Repeated-measures ANOVA 
      with contrast analysis compared change in outcomes across time. There was no 
      significant difference between groups in weight change. Significant improvement 
      in depressive symptoms, outcome expectations, nutrition and eating-related 
      self-efficacy, and cognitive control and disinhibition of control regarding 
      eating behaviors occurred for both groups (all p < .0125) at 3-month follow-up. 
      The SC group had greater increase in nutrition knowledge and self-efficacy than 
      the MB-EAT-D group (all p < .05) at 3-month follow-up. MB-EAT-D had significant 
      increase in mindfulness, whereas the SC group had significant increase in fruit 
      and vegetable consumption at study end (all p < .0125). Both SC and MB-EAT-D were 
      effective treatments for diabetes self-management. The availability of mindful 
      eating and DSME-based approaches offers patients greater choices in meeting their 
      self-care needs.

TI  - Neurobiological Aspects of Mindfulness in Pain Autoregulation: Unexpected Results 
      from a Randomized-Controlled Trial and Possible Implications for Meditation 
      Research.
PG  - 674
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2016.00674 [doi]
LID - 674
AB  - Background: Research has demonstrated that short meditation training may yield 
      higher pain tolerance in acute experimental pain. Our study aimed at examining 
      underlying mechanisms of this alleged effect. In addition, placebo research has 
      shown that higher pain tolerance is mediated via endogenous neuromodulators: 
      experimental inhibition of opioid receptors by naloxone antagonized this effect. 
      We performed a trial to discern possible placebo from meditation-specific effects 
      on pain tolerance and attention. Objectives: It was proposed that (i) meditation 
      training will increase pain tolerance; (ii) naloxone will inhibit this effect; 
      (iii) increased pain tolerance will correlate with improved attention performance 
      and mindfulness. Methods: Randomized-controlled, partly blinded trial with 31 
      healthy meditation-naïve adults. Pain tolerance was assessed by the tourniquet 
      test, attention performance was measured by Attention Network Test (ANT), 
      self-perceived mindfulness by Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory. 16 participants 
      received a 5-day meditation training, focusing on body/breath awareness; the 
      control group (N = 15) received no intervention. Measures were taken before the 
      intervention and on 3 consecutive days after the training, with all participants 
      receiving either no infusion, naloxone infusion, or saline infusion (blinded). 
      Blood samples were taken in order to determine serum morphine and morphine 
      glucuronide levels by applying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      analysis. Results: The meditation group produced fewer errors in ANT. 
      Paradoxically, increases in pain tolerance occurred in both groups (accentuated 
      in control), and correlated with reported mindfulness. Naloxone showed a trend to 
      decrease pain tolerance in both groups. Plasma analyses revealed sporadic 
      morphine and/or morphine metabolite findings with no discernable pattern. 
      Discussion: Main objectives could not be verified. Since underlying study goals 
      had not been made explicit to participants, on purpose (framing effects toward a 
      hypothesized mindfulness-pain tolerance correlation were thus avoided, trainees 
      had not been instructed how to 'use' mindfulness, regarding pain), the question 
      remains open whether lack of meditation effects on pain tolerance was due to 
      these intended 'non-placebo' conditions, cultural effects, or other confounders, 
      or on an unsuitable paradigm. Conclusion: Higher pain tolerance through 
      meditation could not be confirmed.

TI  - Does mindfulness-based cognitive therapy with tapering support reduce risk of 
      relapse/recurrence in major depressive disorder by enhancing positive affect? A 
      secondary analysis of the PREVENT trial.
PG  - 619-629
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000902 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a viable alternative to 
      maintenance antidepressant medication (M-ADM) to reduce risk of 
      relapse/recurrence (RR) in recurrent depression, but its mechanism of action is 
      not yet fully articulated. This secondary analysis of the PREVENT trial examined 
      if MBCT with support to taper medication (MBCT-TS) reduces risk of RR in part by 
      enhancing positive affect (PA). METHOD: In a single-blind, parallel, group 
      randomized controlled trial, adults with ≥3 prior depressive episodes, but not 
      currently in episode and who were taking M-ADM, were randomized to receive either 
      MBCT-TS or ongoing maintenance M-ADM. The primary outcome was RR over 24-month 
      follow-up. Levels of positive affect were assessed at intake and posttreatment. 
      The original PREVENT trial was preregistered (ISRCTN 26666654), but this 
      secondary analysis was not. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-four individuals 
      (predominantly female and of White British ethnicity) were recruited, with 212 
      randomized to each arm. MBCT-TS led to significantly greater PA relative to M-ADM 
      at posttreatment assessment (Δ = 2.78, 95% CI [1.47, 4.08], p < .001). RR was 
      experienced during follow-up by 194 individuals (100 M-ADM; 94 MBCT-TS). Greater 
      intake PA predicted a reduced hazard of RR across treatments (p < .001; hazard 
      ratio = .96, 95% CI [0.94, 0.98]). In individuals who had not relapsed by 
      posttreatment with complete data (121 M-ADM; 145 MBCT-TS), greater increase in PA 
      from intake to posttreatment mediated reduced risk of subsequent RR (p = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that greater levels of PA predict reduced 
      risk of RR and that MBCT-TS in part acts to protect from RR when withdrawing from 
      M-ADM by increasing PA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

AB  - Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant issue in the United 
      States, characterized by chronic relapse following periods of abstinence. One of 
      the primary precursors to relapse is craving. Findings from several studies have 
      shown a negative association between trait mindfulness and craving in clinical 
      samples; however, further research is needed to understand mechanisms underlying 
      this relationship. Purpose/Objectives: The current study assessed thought 
      suppression as a partial mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness 
      and craving. Methods: The current study used data from a previous randomized 
      controlled trial of adults (N = 244) enrolled in community-based treatment for 
      substance use disorder (SUD). Results: Analyses showed a significant moderate 
      positive association between thought suppression and craving, a significant 
      moderate negative association between thought suppression and trait mindfulness, 
      and a significant moderate negative association between trait mindfulness and 
      craving. Subsequent analyses confirmed a partial mediating role of thought 
      suppression in the relationship between trait mindfulness and craving, indicating 
      the inverse relationship between trait mindfulness and craving was partially 
      explained by thought suppression. Conclusions/importance: These findings may 
      inform treatment for SUD. Specifically, targeting thought suppression through 
      mindfulness-based treatment approaches may be a mechanism through which craving 
      can be reduced.

AB  - Contemplative practice has demonstrated benefits for mental health and 
      well-being. Most previous studies, however, implemented in-person trainings 
      containing a mix of different, mostly solitary, practices and focused on pre- to 
      post-training outcomes. In this randomized trial, we explore the immediate 
      differential efficacy of two daily app-delivered practices in shifting emotional 
      (valence, arousal) and thinking patterns (thought content on future-past, 
      self-other, positive-negative dimensions). For 10 weeks of daily training, 212 
      participants (18-65 years) performed either a novel 12-min partner-based 
      socio-emotional practice (Affect Dyad) or a 12-min attention-focused solitary 
      mindfulness-based practice. Using ordinal Bayesian multilevel modeling, we found 
      that both practice types led to more positive affect and higher arousal. However, 
      whereas mindfulness-based practice partly led to a decrease in active thoughts, 
      particularly in future-, other-related and negative thoughts, the Dyad in 
      contrast led to increases in other-related, and positive thoughts. This shift 
      towards more social and positive thoughts may specifically support overcoming 
      ruminative thinking patterns associated with self-related and negative thought 
      content. Overall, these differential findings may help inform the adaptation of 
      scalable app-based mental trainings in different segments of the population with 
      the goal to improve mental health and well-being.

TI  - The relationship between mindfulness and empathy with the oxytocinergic system in 
      persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders - A proof-of-concept randomized

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study explored the feasibility and acceptability as well 
      as the impact of mindfulness-based group therapy (MBGT) on oxytocin levels (OXT) 
      and clinical parameters in outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders 
      (SSD). METHODS: In a randomized-controlled design, outpatients with SSD (N = 48) 
      were assigned to either MBGT in addition to German university-level treatment as 
      usual (MBGT+TAU; n = 25) or TAU (n = 23). At baseline and at four-week 
      post-intervention, clinical parameters and OXT levels were determined. RESULTS: 
      Results indicate high feasibility and acceptance with a 95.7% adherence- and 94% 
      retention- rate of MBGT in SSD. While no significant changes in empathy were 
      observed, MBGT+TAU demonstrated a significant reduction in positive symptoms 
      (Positive and Negative Syndrom Scale) compared to TAU at post-intervention. OXT 
      levels were significantly increased in MBGT+TAU at post-intervention, suggesting 
      a potential link between mindfulness and the oxytocinergic system in SSD. 
      Additionally, improvements in various clinical parameters were indicated. 
      CONCLUSION: The study contributes to the growing evidence supporting feasibility, 
      acceptability, and positive effects of MBGT in outpatients with SSD, emphasizing 
      the need for further research to solidify these findings. Overall, this work 
      sheds first evidence on the intersection of mindfulness, oxytocin, and clinical 
      outcomes in SSD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Insomnia has widespread negative implications for health and 
      well-being. Online delivery of mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) has 
      not previously been evaluated. This study investigated the feasibility and 
      preliminary efficacy of a digital MBTI program for improving insomnia symptoms. 
      It was hypothesized that a 6-week digital MBTI program would reduce insomnia 
      symptoms and pre-sleep arousal and improve mood, compared to a waitlist control 
      condition. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants (M = 29.44, SD = 11.97 years) 
      experiencing insomnia symptoms (insomnia severity index [ISI] ≥ 8) were 
      randomized to either a 6-week intervention or waitlist condition. Participants 
      completed the ISI, pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and the positive and negative 
      affect schedule at baseline, mid-, and post-study. Feasibility was assessed 
      across four domains (acceptability, implementation, practicality, and preliminary 
      efficacy) using self-reports, attrition, program completions, and module 
      completions. RESULTS: Feasibility data for the intervention indicated that there 
      was 22% attrition, and 79% of the modules were completed. There were 
      significantly greater reductions in the severity of insomnia symptoms (p < .001) 
      and both cognitive (p = .03) and somatic (p = .02) subscales of the PSAS, at 
      post-intervention compared to the waitlist group. There were no significant group 
      differences in mood. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence of the 
      feasibility and efficacy of a digital MBTI, which may assist in the broader 
      dissemination of insomnia treatment.Trial RegistrationAustralian and New Zealand

      (CBT) for social anxiety disorder to model the core constructs of the MMT 
      (attentional control, decentering, broadened awareness, reappraisal, and positive 
      affect) in a multivariate path analysis. RESULTS: Findings indicated that 
      increases in attentional control from baseline to post-training predicted 
      increases in decentering by 3 months post-treatment (p<.01) that in turn 
      predicted increases in broadened awareness of interoceptive and exteroceptive 
      data by 6 months post-treatment (p<.001). In turn, broadened awareness predicted 
      increases in the use of reappraisal by 9 months post-treatment (p<.01), which 
      culminated in greater positive affect at 12 months post-treatment (p<.001). MBSR 
      led to significantly greater increases in decentering (p<.05) and broadened 
      awareness than CBT (p<.05). Significant indirect effects indicated that increases 
      in decentering mediated the effect of mindfulness training on broadening 
      awareness, which in turn mediated enhanced reappraisal efficacy. CONCLUSION: 
      Results suggest that the mechanisms of change identified by the MMT form an 
      iterative chain that promotes long-term increases in positive affectivity. Though 
      these mechanisms may reflect common therapeutic factors that cut across 
      mindfulness-based and cognitive-behavioral interventions, MBSR specifically 
      boosts the MMT cycle by producing significantly greater increases in decentering 
      and broadened awareness than CBT, providing support for the foundational 
      assumption in the MMT that mindfulness training may be a key means of stimulating 
      downstream positive psychological processes.

TI  - Effects of a Brief Electronic Mindfulness-Based Intervention on Relieving 
      Prenatal Depression and Anxiety in Hospitalized High-Risk Pregnant Women: 
      Exploratory Pilot Study.
PG  - e17593
LID - 10.2196/17593 [doi]
LID - e17593
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripartum depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and 
      are correlated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Antenatal care in 
      Germany does not yet include structured screening and effective low-threshold 
      treatment options for women facing peripartum depression and anxiety disorders. 
      Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly becoming a focus of 
      interest for the management of such patients. Studies have shown a decrease in 
      pregnancy-related stress and anxiety in expectant mothers following mindfulness 
      programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical 
      effectiveness of a 1-week electronic course of mindfulness on prenatal depression 
      and anxiety in hospitalized, high-risk pregnant women. We hypothesized that 
      participating in a 1-week electronic MBI (eMBI) could alleviate symptoms of 
      depression and anxiety during the hospital stay. METHODS: A prospective pilot 
      study with an explorative study design was conducted from January to May 2019 in 
      a sample of 68 women hospitalized due to high-risk pregnancies. After enrolling 
      into the study, the participants were given access to an eMBI app on how to deal 
      with stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. Psychometric parameters were 
      assessed via electronic questionnaires comprising the Edinburgh Postnatal 
      Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), and abridged 
      version of the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R). RESULTS: We 
      observed a high prevalence of peripartum depression and anxiety among 
      hospitalized high-risk pregnant women: 39% (26/67) of the study participants in 
      the first assessment and 41% (16/39) of the participants in the second assessment 
      achieved EPDS scores above the cutoff value for minor/major depression. The 
      number of participants with anxiety levels above the cutoff value (66% [45/68] of 
      the participants in the first assessment and 67% [26/39] of the participants in 
      the second assessment) was significantly more than that of the participants with 
      anxiety levels below the cutoff value, as measured with the STAI-S. After 
      completing the 1-week electronic course on mindfulness, the participants showed a 
      significant reduction in the mean state anxiety levels (P<.03). Regarding 
      pregnancy-related anxiety, participants who completed more than 50% of the 1-week 
      course showed lower scores in PRAQ-R in the second assessment (P<.05). No 
      significant changes in the EPDS scores were found after completing the 
      intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Peripartum anxiety and depression represent a relevant 
      health issue in hospitalized pregnant patients. Short-term eMBIs could have the 
      potential to reduce anxiety levels and pregnancy-related anxiety. However, we 
      observed that compliance to eMBI seems to be related to lower symptoms of 
      pregnancy-related stress among high-risk patients. eMBIs represent accessible 
      mental health resources at reduced costs and can be adapted for hospitalized 
      patients during pregnancy.

TI  - An intervention to improve coping strategies in adult male prisoners with a 
      history of traumatic brain injury: A pilot randomised clinical trial.
PG  - 1185-1195
LID - 10.1177/0269215521998535 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a psychological intervention improves coping, 
      post-concussion symptoms and decreases in-prison infractions in adult males with 
      a history of traumatic brain injury. DESIGN: A single centre, randomised, 
      wait-list, pilot study. SETTING: A high security prison in New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 
      Fifty-five adult male participants who had experienced at least one traumatic 
      brain injury in their lifetime (mean age 37.29 +/-9.81 years). INTERVENTION: A 
      manualised ten session, in-person, group based combined Cognitive Behavioural 
      Therapy /Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction intervention versus wait list 
      control. MAIN MEASURES: The Negative Affect Repair Questionnaire and Rivermead 
      Post-concussion Symptom Questionnaire were completed at baseline, 
      post-intervention (five weeks) and at 12 week follow up. In-prison misconduct 
      charges and negative file notes were reviewed for the previous five weeks at each 
      assessment time point. RESULTS: There was an improvement in the use of calming 
      and distraction strategies in the intervention group from baseline (x̄ = 17.38, 
      SD = 3.57) to post-intervention (x̄ = 18.67, SD = 3.84) and 12-week follow up 
      (x̄ = 18.13, SD = 2.63). Participants in the intervention group had significantly 
      higher negative affect repair on the calming and distractive strategies subscale 
      following completion of the intervention, compared to wait-list controls 
      (F = 4.69, P = 0.04) with a moderate effect size (η(p)(2) = 0.11). Improvements 
      in use of calming and distractive strategies was not sustained at the twelve-week 
      follow-up (F = 0.87, P = 0.36). There was no-significant improvement on other 
      negative affect subscales or for post-concussion symptoms or decrease in-prison 
      infractions. CONCLUSION: A manualised psychological intervention may have the 
      potential to facilitate the development of positive coping strategies in 
      prisoners with a history of traumatic brain injury.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a virtual reality 
      (VR) program designed and developed based on the hallucinogenic harm reduction 
      and integration (PHRI) clinical model could be more effective in guiding positive 
      thinking training, improving positive thinking awareness and ability, and, to 
      some extent, facilitating personal efficacy and emotional state compared to a 
      traditional VR program that places users in a virtual natural ecological 
      environment to guide positive thinking training. We also sought to understand the 
      factors that may influence the effectiveness of VR interventions and user 
      experience. METHOD: Seventy-six randomly recruited participants were divided into 
      a control group and an experimental group of 38 participants, each according to a 
      random number table, and were trained in VR meditation for eight weeks. The 
      experimental group used a PHRI-based mindfulness program, while the control group 
      used a traditional mindfulness meditation program. We used The Mindful Attention 
      Awareness Scale and the PAD emotional three-dimensional scale to assess the level 
      of state mindfulness and changes in the emotional state before and at the end of 
      the experiment. The Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire measured the user's sense 
      of presence and immersion in the virtual environment. The Five Facet Mindfulness 
      Questionnaires and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used at 
      the baseline assessment stage before and at the 4-week follow-up after the 
      experiment to assess the change in trait mindfulness levels due to the 
      mindfulness training. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaires and the DASS-21 
      were used to assess changes in mindfulness and mental health trait levels. 
      RESULTS: At the end of the experiment, the MMSQ score was significantly lower in 
      the control group than in the experimental group, while the ITQ score was 
      significantly higher than in the experimental group, and both scores were 
      statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the follow-up assessment four weeks 
      after the end of the experiment, the FFMQ-15 score and the DASS-21 were 
      significantly and statistically higher in the experimental group than in the 
      control group (p < 0.05). Since the scores of the PAD scale did not obey a normal 
      distribution, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the results, which 
      proved that the experimental group had higher levels of emotional activation and 
      arousal. CONCLUSION: The VR positive thinking program developed based on PHRI can 
      significantly increase the positive thinking state and emotional arousal and 
      activation of the general population participants but does not directly lead to 
      the growth of positive emotions. Moreover, this detached psychedelic scene brings 
      users a weaker sense of presence and presence than traditional natural space 
      scenes. Furthermore, it does not bring any intense simulator motion sickness 
      symptoms. These findings suggest that VR programs developed based on PHRI have a 
      more positive facilitation effect on the positive state and that this increase 
      lasts longer than conventional VR-positive programs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness meditation has successfully been applied to cultivate 
      skills in self-regulation of emotion, as it employs the unbiased present moment 
      awareness of experience. This heightened attention to and awareness of sensory 
      experience has been postulated to create an optimal therapeutic exposure 
      condition and thereby improve extinction learning. We recently demonstrated 
      increased connectivity in hippocampal circuits during the contextual retrieval of 
      extinction memory following mindfulness training. METHODS: Here, we examine the 
      role of structural changes in hippocampal subfields following mindfulness 
      training in a randomized controlled longitudinal study using a two-day 
      fear-conditioning and extinction protocol. RESULTS: We demonstrate an association 
      between mindfulness training-related increases in subiculum and decreased 
      hippocampal connectivity to lateral occipital regions during contextual retrieval 
      of extinguished fear. Further, we demonstrate an association between decreased 
      connectivity and decreases in self-reported anxiety following mindfulness 
      training. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of the subiculum in gating 
      interactions with contextual stimuli during memory retrieval and, also, the 
      mechanisms through which mindfulness training may foster resilience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has shown positive effects on mental health, mental 
      capacity and well-being among adult population. Among children and adolescents, 
      previous research on the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions on health and 
      well-being has shown promising results, but studies with methodologically sound 
      designs have been called for. Few intervention studies in this population have 
      compared the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to alternative intervention 
      programs with adequate sample sizes. METHODS/DESIGN: Our primary aim is to 
      explore the effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness intervention program 
      compared to a standard relaxation program among a non-clinical children and 
      adolescent sample, and a non-treatment control group in school context. In this 
      study, we systematically examine the effects of mindfulness intervention on 
      mental well-being (primary outcomes being resilience; existence/absence of 
      depressive symptoms; experienced psychological strengths and difficulties), 
      cognitive functions, psychophysiological responses, academic achievements, and 
      motivational determinants of practicing mindfulness. The design is a cluster 
      randomized controlled trial with three arms (mindfulness intervention group, 
      active control group, non-treatment group) and the sample includes 59 Finnish 
      schools and approx. 3 000 students aged 12-15 years. Intervention consists of 
      nine mindfulness based lessons, 45 mins per week, for 9 weeks, the dose being 
      identical in active control group receiving standard relaxation program called 
      Relax. The programs are delivered by 14 educated facilitators. Students, their 
      teachers and parents will fill-in the research questionnaires before and after 
      the intervention, and they will all be followed up 6 months after baseline. 
      Additionally, students will be followed 12 months after baseline. For longer 
      follow-up, consent to linking the data to the main health registers has been 
      asked from students and their parents. DISCUSSION: The present study examines 
      systematically the effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness program compared 
      to a standard relaxation program, and a non-treatment control group. A strength 
      of the current study lies in its methodologically rigorous, randomized controlled 
      study design, which allows novel evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness 
      over and above a standard relaxation program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN18642659 
      . Retrospectively registered 13 October 2015.

TI  - Feasibility and acceptability of a virtual mindfulness intervention for Black 
      adults with PTSD and depression: Randomized controlled trial.
LID - 100048 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.xjmad.2024.100048 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) offers promise as a group-based 
      intervention to alleviate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression 
      symptoms in traumatized Black adults. Given the high level of barriers that exist 
      for low-income Black adults, virtual delivery of MBCT may be helpful. This pilot 
      randomized controlled trial assessed feasibility and acceptability of an adapted 
      8-week virtual MBCT group intervention for Black adults screening positive for 
      PTSD and depression. Forty-six participants (89.3% women) recruited from an urban 
      safety net hospital were randomized to MBCT or waitlist control (WLC). Overall 
      feasibility was fair (70%); however, completion rates were higher for WLC than 
      MBCT (90% vs. 54%). Group acceptability was high across quantitative and 
      qualitative measures for study completers. Perceived barriers to psychological 
      treatment were high (>9). While showing potential via improved coping skills and 
      positive health changes, this intervention's success hinges on mitigating 
      engagement barriers for future delivery; additional studies are warranted.

      thinking and subjective time perspective: a randomized active-controlled study.
PG  - 1275-1298
LID - 10.1080/08870446.2020.1836178 [doi]
AB  - ObjectivePreliminary findings suggest that different kinds of meditation could 
      work on diverse cognitive and psychological processes. The present study aimed at 
      disentangling the effects of three mindfulness techniques on mental rumination 
      and subjective time perspective. Design: 75 young healthy participants were 
      randomly assigned to one of four conditions: mindful breathing, body scan, 
      observing-thoughts meditation and an active control condition. The meditation 
      groups practiced mindfulness daily and attended weekly group meetings for 
      8 weeks, while the control group was involved in reading and discussing a book 
      about mindfulness. Main outcome measures: Self-report measures of mindfulness 
      skills, ruminative thinking, attitude towards time, anxiety, depression and 
      personality traits. Results: In all meditation conditions, analysis of covariance 
      showed a significant improvement in mindfulness skills compared to the control 
      group. We found a specific effect of mindful breathing in reducing participants' 
      tendency to brooding and in increasing their positive vision of the future, 
      compared to all other conditions. Conclusions: As expected, we found some 
      differential effects: breathing meditation helped practitioners to train more 
      effectively their ability to disengage from maladaptive ruminative thoughts, 
      which could be reflected in a more optimistic attitude toward the future. These 
      results provide useful information to structure better mindfulness-based 
      interventions.

TI  - Enhancing cognitive and social-emotional development through a 
      simple-to-administer mindfulness-based school program for elementary school 
      children: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 52-66
LID - 10.1037/a0038454 [doi]
AB  - The authors hypothesized that a social and emotional learning (SEL) program 
      involving mindfulness and caring for others, designed for elementary school 
      students, would enhance cognitive control, reduce stress, promote well-being and 
      prosociality, and produce positive school outcomes. To test this hypothesis, 4 
      classes of combined 4th and 5th graders (N = 99) were randomly assigned to 
      receive the SEL with mindfulness program versus a regular social responsibility 
      program. Measures assessed executive functions (EFs), stress physiology via 
      salivary cortisol, well-being (self-reports), prosociality and peer acceptance 
      (peer reports), and math grades. Relative to children in the social 
      responsibility program, children who received the SEL program with mindfulness 
      (a) improved more in their cognitive control and stress physiology; (b) reported 
      greater empathy, perspective-taking, emotional control, optimism, school 
      self-concept, and mindfulness, (c) showed greater decreases in self-reported 
      symptoms of depression and peer-rated aggression, (d) were rated by peers as more 
      prosocial, and (e) increased in peer acceptance (or sociometric popularity). The 
      results of this investigation suggest the promise of this SEL intervention and 
      address a lacuna in the scientific literature-identifying strategies not only to 
      ameliorate children's problems but also to cultivate their well-being and 
      thriving. Directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based yogic breathing on craving, affect, and smoking 
      behavior.

AB  - Breathing practices are often incorporated into treatments for tobacco 
      dependence, but there is little direct research testing the efficacy of breathing 
      practices. This study examined the effects of a mindfulness-based yogic breathing 
      (MB) intervention versus active treatment (cognitive strategy [CS]) and 
      no-treatment (NT) control groups on craving, affect, withdrawal, and smoking 
      behavior. Smokers (N = 60; 50% female; 83% African American) were randomized to 
      receive 20 min of MB, CS, or NT. Participants completed self-report measures 
      before and after the manipulation and then took part in a 50-min smoking choice 
      procedure. Afterward, participants were advised to use the techniques they 
      learned and self-monitor smoking for 24 hr. They received 3 reminder text 
      messages and returned to the lab the following day. MB and CS were more effective 
      than NT in decreasing craving to smoke and perceived nicotine withdrawal. MB, but 
      not CS, was more effective than NT in reducing negative affect. MB reduced the 
      risk of smoking by more than twofold relative to both CS and NT during the 
      smoking choice procedure. Participants in the MB condition smoked fewer 
      cigarettes than those in the CS and NT conditions in the 24 hr following the 
      manipulation. There were no differential effects of the manipulations on state 
      mindfulness or positive affect. Mindful yogic breathing appears to be 
      particularly effective in alleviating the acute negative effects of smoking 
      abstinence and decreasing smoking behavior. Mindful breathing techniques are 
      safe, simple, and cost-effective strategies that deserve additional research 
      attention, especially among underserved populations of smokers. (PsycINFO

TI  - A single-blind, randomized, pilot study of a brief mindfulness-based intervention 
      for the endometriosis-related pain management.
PG  - 1147-1162
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1939 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with endometriosis suffer from frequent symptoms despite 
      multiple treatments in tertiary care. Although there is a need for a 
      biopsychosocial perspective on endometriosis treatment, few conservative 
      treatments have been investigated. We aimed to investigate the effects of a brief 
      Mindfulness-Based Intervention (bMBI) in women with deep endometriosis who remain 
      symptomatic despite undergoing conventional medical treatment. METHODS: A 
      randomized controlled trial was performed with two groups: a standard medical 
      treatment plus bMBI program and only standard medical treatment as a control. A 
      total of 63 eligible participants were randomized to bMBI and control groups. The 
      primary outcome was endometriosis-related pain, and secondary outcomes were 
      quality of life and stress perception post-treatment. Analyses were carried out 
      using multiple regression models. RESULTS: The results show that bMBI 
      significantly improved pain unpleasantness (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.67, NNT = 3.2), 
      pelvic pain (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.16, NNT = 5.3) and dyschezia (Cohen's f(2) 
       = 0.23, NNT = 2.9) immediately post-treatment and decreased all 
      endometriosis-related pain (Cohen's f(2) ranging from 0.20 to 0.60 and NNT 
      ranging from 5 to -9) after the follow-up. We found an extensive positive effect 
      of bMBI on the mental health dimension in the two time point measures (Cohen's 
      f(2)  = 0.34 and 0.25, NNT = 3.5 and 2.3) and vitality (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.22, 
      NNT = 2.1) after the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that bMBI is 
      useful for managing endometriosis-related pain and restoring women's 
      psychological well-being. SIGNIFICANCE: Brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention 
      (bMBI) improved endometriosis-related pain and mental health compared to standard 
      medical care. The present findings contribute to the applicability of MBI in 
      visceral pain patients.

AB  - Those with high baseline stress levels are more likely to develop mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While meditation may reduce stress 
      and alter the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN), little is known about 
      its impact in these populations. Our objective was to conduct a "proof of 
      concept" trial to determine whether Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) 
      would improve DMN connectivity and reduce hippocampal atrophy among adults with 
      MCI. 14 adults with MCI were randomized to MBSR vs. usual care and underwent 
      resting state fMRI at baseline and follow-up. Seed based functional connectivity 
      was applied using posterior cingulate cortex as seed. Brain morphometry analyses 
      were performed using FreeSurfer. The results showed that after the intervention, 
      MBSR participants had increased functional connectivity between the posterior 
      cingulate cortex and bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus 
      compared to controls. In addition, MBSR participants had trends of less bilateral 
      hippocampal volume atrophy than control participants. These preliminary results 
      indicate that in adults with MCI, MBSR may have a positive impact on the regions 
      of the brain most related to MCI and AD. Further research with larger sample 
      sizes and longer-follow-up are needed to further investigate the results from 
      this pilot study.

TI  - A Systematic Review of a Polyvagal Perspective on Embodied Contemplative 
      Practices as Promoters of Cardiorespiratory Coupling and Traumatic Stress 
      Recovery for PTSD and OCD: Research Methodologies and State of the Art.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182211778 [doi]
LID - 11778
AB  - Baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been proposed as a 
      transdiagnostic biomarker of stress vulnerability across psychopathologies, and a 
      reliable association between PTSD, OCD and lower resting RSA was found. 
      Contemplative practices have been linked to the activation of the vagus as well 
      as to an increased RSA that, according to the polyvagal theory, reflects the 
      activation of the ventral vagal complex (VVC) and may promote PTSD and OCD 
      recovery. PubMed and Scopus databases were selected to conduct a search following 
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      2020 guidelines, and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) 
      was used to appraise the methodological quality for this systematic review. Six 
      articles met the inclusion criteria (one cross-sectional study, one study with 
      pre-post measurements, two cohort studies and two RCT studies). 
      Mindfulness-related interventions promoted parasympathetic activity, an increased 
      vagal tone and improvements in PTSD and OCD symptoms. According to the polyvagal 
      theory, mindfulness-related and compassion-related meditations would be 
      conceptualized as neural exercises expanding the capacity of the ventral vagal 
      complex to regulate the present state and to promote resilience. Clinical and 
      methodological issues are discussed.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of a 12-week afterschool mindfulness-based diet 
      and exercise intervention on mental and physical health in Latinx and Black 
      youth. One hundred forty-eight boys and girls (average age = 10.1 years, SD = 1.3 
      years; 52% girls; 72.3% Latinx) were randomized to either the experimental group 
      (n = 80) or the control group (n = 68). The experimental group participants 
      engaged in fitness yoga, kickboxing, and/or spinning sessions, and mindfulness 
      practices (e.g., breathing, meditation, and mindful eating) twice per week for 12 
      weeks. The control group participants engaged in a recreational play session once 
      per week for 12 weeks. All participants completed surveys (demographics, 
      acculturation, anxiety, emotional eating, sleep, and food intake) and had their 
      height, weight, and percent body fat measured pre- and post-intervention. 
      Participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days pre- and post-intervention. 
      Repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that the experimental group 
      participants reported lower scores in emotional eating, anxiety, and sleep 
      latency post-intervention compared to the control group participants. Conversely, 
      no significant differences were observed in physical activity between the 
      experimental and control group participants post-intervention. These findings 
      indicate that a mindfulness-based intervention has a positive effect on emotional 
      eating, anxiety, and sleep latency among youth of color.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Stress among health care professionals is well documented. The use of 
      mindfulness-based interventions to reduce stress has shown promising results; 
      however, the time commitment of typical programs can be a barrier to successful 
      implementation in health care settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and 
      feasibility of a brief mindfulness-based program to reduce stress during work 
      hours among health care professionals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial was conducted among full-time health 
      care professionals at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health in 
      Bethesda, Maryland, between September 2017 and May 2018. Participants were 
      randomized to receive mindfulness-based self-care (MBSC) training or 
      life-as-usual control. Data were analyzed from June 2018 to January 2020. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The MBSC intervention included 5 weekly, 1.5-hour in-class 
      mindfulness practice sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stress level was the 
      primary outcome, assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item version. 
      Secondary outcomes included anxiety, burnout, positive and negative affect, 
      mindfulness (trait and state), and self-care. Assessments were taken at baseline 
      and at the end of the intervention (week 5) in the intervention and control 
      groups, and at follow-up (week 13) in the intervention group to test for a 
      maintenance effect. A postprogram evaluation was also obtained. RESULTS: Of 82 
      randomized participants, 78 who completed the study at week 5 were included in 
      the modified intent-to-treat analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 32 
      [23-48] years; 65 [83%] women), including 43 participants in the MBSC group and 
      35 participants in the control group. At the end of the intervention, compared 
      with the control group, the MBSC group had reduced levels of stress (mean [SD] 
      score, 17.29 [5.84] vs 18.54 [6.30]; P = .02) and anxiety (mean [SD] score, 2.58 
      [1.52] vs 4.23 [1.73]; P < .001), and improved positive affect (mean [SD] score, 
      35.69 [7.12] vs 31.42 [7.27]; P < .001), state mindfulness (mean [SD] score, 3.74 
      [1.18] vs 2.78 [1.16]; P < .001), and mindful self-care (mean [SD] score, 7.29 
      [2.44] vs 5.54 [2.77]; P < .001). Burnout, negative affect, and trait mindfulness 
      levels did not differ between groups. Changes within the MBSC group through 
      follow-up included sustained reductions in stress (change, -6.14; 95% CI, -7.84 
      to -4.44; P < .001), anxiety (change, -1.46; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.94; P < .001), 
      trait mindfulness (change, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.90; P < .001), and state 
      mindfulness (change, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that this brief mindfulness-based 
      intervention was an effective and feasible means to reduce stress in health care 
      professionals. Larger studies are needed to assess the effects on clinical care 
      and patient outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - The Age-Well randomized controlled trial of the Medit-Ageing European project: 
      Effect of meditation or foreign language training on brain and mental health in 
      older adults.
PG  - 714-723
LID - 10.1016/j.trci.2018.10.011 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Age-Well clinical trial is an ongoing monocentric, randomized, 
      controlled trial aiming to assess an 18-month preventive meditation-based 
      intervention directly targeting the attentional and emotional dimensions of aging 
      to promote mental health and well-being in elderly people. METHODS: One hundred 
      thirty-seven cognitively unimpaired older adults are randomized to either an 
      18-month meditation-based intervention, a structurally matched foreign language 
      training, or a passive control arm. The impact of the intervention and underlying 
      mechanisms are assessed with detailed cognitive, behavioral, biological, 
      neuroimaging and sleep examinations. RESULTS: Recruitment began in late 2016 and 
      ended in May 2018. The interventions are ongoing and will be completed by 
      early 2020. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial addressing the emotional and 
      cognitive dimension of aging with a long-term nonpharmacological approach and 
      using comprehensive assessments to investigate the mechanisms. Results are 
      expected to foster the development of preventive strategies reducing the negative 
      impact of mental conditions and disorders.

AB  - The mental health crisis in graduate education combined with low treatment rates 
      among engineering graduate students underscores the need for engineering graduate 
      programs to provide effective methods to promote well-being. There is an 
      extensive body of neuroscience research showing that contemplative practices, 
      such as mindfulness, produce measurable effects on brain function and overall 
      well-being. We hypothesized that a mindfulness-based training program designed 
      for engineering graduate students would improve emotional well-being and, 
      secondarily, enhance research capacity. An initial pilot study was conducted at a 
      single institution (Phase 1), followed by a larger study conducted at both the 
      original and a second institution (Phase 2) to gather additional data and show 
      the program's transferability. The program comprised eight weekly mindfulness 
      training sessions. Individuals in the study were randomly assigned to either an 
      intervention group or wait-list control group. We administered pre- and post-test 
      surveys with quantitative measures designed to assess emotional and physical 
      well-being, as well as creativity, research satisfaction, and desire to 
      contribute to the betterment of society. Participants also completed a summative 
      survey to evaluate the impact of the program on their well-being and research. 
      Analysis revealed statistically significant findings: improved emotional health, 
      decreased neuroticism, increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and 
      increased mindfulness in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. 
      Intervention groups in Phase 2 also reported statistically significant 
      improvement in satisfaction with their research. Our findings suggest that 
      mindfulness training has the potential to play a vital professional and personal 
      development role in graduate engineering education.

TI  - Affective Neural Mechanisms of a Parenting-Focused Mindfulness Intervention.
PG  - 392-404
LID - 10.1007/s12671-019-01118-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Behavioral evidence suggests that parenting-focused mindfulness 
      interventions can improve parenting practices and enhance family wellbeing, 
      potentially operating through altered emotional processing in parents. However, 
      the mechanisms through which parent mindfulness interventions achieve their 
      positive benefits have not yet been empirically tested, knowledge which is key to 
      refine and maximize intervention effects. Thus, as part of a randomized 
      controlled trial, the present study examined the affective mechanisms of an 
      8-week parenting-focused mindfulness intervention, the Parenting Mindfully (PM) 
      intervention, versus a minimal-intervention parent education control. METHODS: 
      Twenty highly stressed mothers of adolescents completed pre- and 
      post-intervention behavioral and fMRI sessions, in which mothers completed a 
      parent-adolescent conflict interaction, fMRI emotion task, and fMRI resting state 
      scan. Mothers reported on their mindful parenting, and maternal emotional 
      reactivity to the parent-adolescent conflict task was assessed via observed 
      emotion expression, self-reported negative emotion, and salivary cortisol 
      reactivity. RESULTS: Results indicated that the PM intervention increased brain 
      responsivity in left posterior insula in response to negative affective stimuli, 
      and altered resting state functional connectivity in regions involved in 
      self-reference, behavioral regulation, and social-emotional processing. Changes 
      in mothers' brain function and connectivity were associated with increased 
      mindful parenting and decreased emotional reactivity to the parent-adolescent 
      conflict task. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that mindfulness-based changes in 
      maternal emotional awareness at the neurobiological level are associated with 
      decreased emotional reactivity in parenting interactions, illuminating potential 
      neurobiological targets for future parent-focused intervention.

TI  - Attentional and affective consequences of technology supported mindfulness 
      training: a randomised, active control, efficacy trial.
PG  - 60
LID - 60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training (MT) programs represent an approach to attention 
      training with well-validated mental health benefits. However, research supporting 
      MT efficacy is based predominantly on weekly-meeting, facilitator-led, 
      group-intervention formats. It is unknown whether participants might benefit from 
      neurofeedback-assisted, technology-supported MT (N-tsMT), in which meditation is 
      delivered individually, without the need for a facilitator, travel to a training 
      site, or the presence of a supportive group environment. Mirroring the validation 
      of group MT interventions, the first step in addressing this question requires 
      identifying whether N-tsMT promotes measurable benefits. Here, we report on an 
      initial investigation of a commercial N-tsMT system. METHODS: In a randomized, 
      active control trial, community-dwelling healthy adult participants carried out 
      6 weeks of daily practice, receiving either N-tsMT (n = 13), or a control 
      condition of daily online math training (n = 13). Training effects were assessed 
      on target measures of attention and well-being. Participants also completed daily 
      post-training surveys assessing effects on mood, body awareness, calm, effort, 
      and stress. RESULTS: Analysis revealed training effects specific to N-tsMT, with 
      attentional improvements in overall reaction time on a Stroop task, and 
      well-being improvements via reduced somatic symptoms on the Brief Symptom 
      Inventory. Attention and well-being improvements were correlated, and effects 
      were greatest for the most neurotic participants. However, secondary, exploratory 
      measures of attention and well-being did not show training-specific effects. 
      N-tsMT was associated with greater body awareness and calm, and initially greater 
      effort that later converged with effort in the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Preliminary findings indicate that N-tsMT promotes modest benefits for attention 
      and subjective well-being in a healthy community sample relative to an active 
      control condition. However, the findings would benefit from replication in a 
      larger sample, and more intensive practice or more comprehensive MT instruction 
      might be required to promote the broader benefits typically reported in group 
      format, facilitated MT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials

TI  - Losing trust in body sensations: Interoceptive awareness and depression symptom 
      severity among primary care patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interoceptive dysfunction is emerging as an important biomarker for 
      mental illnesses, such as depression which is a leading cause of disability and 
      death worldwide. Little empirical research explains the relationship between 
      interoception and depression. METHODS: Using multivariable linear regression 
      models and cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized control trial of 
      primary care patients (N = 281), we analyzed the relationship between depression 
      severity (none/slight, mild, and moderate/severe via the PROMIS depression scale) 
      and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) subscales 
      (noticing, not distracting, not worrying, attention regulation, emotional 
      awareness, selfregulation, body listening and trusting). RESULTS: Adjusted 
      results suggest moderate/severe depression was inversely associated with body 
      trusting (p < .001), body listening (p < .01), noticing (p < .01), emotional 
      awareness (p < .01), and self-regulation (p < .05). Mild depression was inversely 
      associated with body trusting (p <.01). After correction for multiple 
      comparisons, the relationship between MAIA body trusting and mild and 
      moderate/severe depression remained significant. LIMITATIONS: Our findings may 
      not be generalizable to other populations or healthcare settings. Additionally, 
      findings cannot be interpreted as causal due to our inability to establish 
      temporality. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of body trust appears important for understanding 
      how individuals with depression interpret or respond to interoceptive stimuli and 
      may represent the leading edge of interoceptive dysregulation seen in depressive 
      disorders. Our findings support a hypothesis about mechanisms of action 
      underlying hypoactivation in depression. Further, these results support clinical 
      identification of subtypes of depression, such as those with high levels of 
      co-occurring anxiety.

TI  - Systematic development of a mobile preconception lifestyle programme for couples 
      undergoing IVF: the PreLiFe-programme.
PG  - 2493-2505
LID - 10.1093/humrep/deab166 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Can we develop a preconception lifestyle programme for couples 
      undergoing IVF that is in line with their needs. SUMMARY ANSWER: A mobile 
      preconception lifestyle programme was systematically developed based on expert 
      opinion, literature and needs of IVF-patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A healthy 
      lifestyle prior to conception is not only beneficial for the general health of 
      couples, but evidence on its importance for their reproductive health and the 
      health of their children is also emerging. So far, the vast majority of fertility 
      clinics do not offer a lifestyle programme for couples undergoing IVF. Therefore, 
      the present study aimed to develop a lifestyle programme for IVF-couples. STUDY 
      DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The development of the PreLiFe-programme was guided by 
      the steps of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing complex 
      interventions, a systematic approach for developing theory- and evidence-based 
      health promotion interventions. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: First, 
      the evidence base on lifestyle programmes for IVF-couples was reviewed. Second, 
      several iterations between an expert panel, the literature, and quantitative and 
      qualitative data from IVF-patients identified the content, the format, behaviour 
      change techniques and theory of the programme. Third, the PreLiFe-programme was 
      produced and the expected process and outcomes of a randomized controlled trial 
      assessing it were modelled. Finally, user tests among experts and patients and 
      pilot tests among patients were conducted. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: The 
      finally developed PreLiFe-programme is a mobile application to be used 
      autonomously by both partners of IVF-couples during the first year of IVF, in 
      combination with motivational interviewing over the telephone every three months 
      (i.e. blended care). The PreLiFe-programme provides advice and skills training on 
      physical activity, diet and mindfulness based stress reduction and is in part 
      tailored based on monitoring and tracking the lifestyle of patients. Based on the 
      literature the expert panel considers it plausible that all three components 
      contribute to IVF-success rates. The PreLiFe-programme is likely to be acceptable 
      to patients as it meets the need of patients for lifestyle advice and treatment 
      information. LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: The pilot in IVF-couples had a 
      3-month duration. The feasibility of the PreLiFe-programme in other infertile 
      populations and/or upon longer use is yet to be examined. Whether the 
      PreLiFe-programme effectively improves lifestyle and IVF-success rates is 
      currently being examined in a trial randomizing heterosexual couples starting IVF 
      to the PreLiFe-programme or an attention-control group for 12 months. WIDER 
      IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: If the PreLiFe-programme improves lifestyle and the 
      chance of IVF-success, it will be a powerful tool and provide guidance for 
      implementing lifestyle programmes in fertility clinics. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING

AB  - Empathy is essential for human survival and social interaction. Although 
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been used to improve empathy in 
      healthy populations, its therapeutic efficacy remains unknown. This study aims to 
      investigate the therapeutic effects of MBIs on empathy in a healthy population 
      and the potential factors affecting the efficacy of MBIs. The literature search 
      focused on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CNKI from 
      inception to September 2022. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental 
      studies reporting the effects of using MBIs on empathy in healthy populations 
      were included. A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Results of the 
      meta-analysis showed that MBIs improved empathy (SMD, 0.372, 95% CI, 0.164-0.579, 
      p = 0.001) in the healthy population compared with that in the control group. 
      Moreover, results of the subgroup analysis showed that intervention dose (over 24 
      h vs. under 24 h), format (online vs. offline), and types (different types) were 
      important factors affecting treatment outcomes. This comprehensive review 
      suggests that MBIs are effective treatment for empathy in healthy population. 
      Future research should markedly focus on large-sample, rigorously designed 
      experiments to explore the long-term effects of MBIs on empathy and to elucidate 
      the underlying mechanisms of MBIs. This study provides a reference for the daily 
      application of MBIs.

TI  - Using Photovoice in a Mindfulness-Based Program to Understand the Experiences of 
      Caregivers of Young Adults with Psychosis.

LID - 15461
AB  - Studies have consistently shown that family caregivers experience caregiver 
      burden and depression when they provide care for family members with psychosis. 
      Photovoice is a participatory action research method of fostering dialogues about 
      personal experiences by sharing and discussing photographs that may improve our 
      understanding about how a mindfulness-based family psychoeducation program 
      (MBFPE) can reduce the caregiver burden and improve their caregiving experience. 
      We explored the experiences of the participants in their use of photovoice in a 
      MBFPE. We investigated whether the MBFPE program generated positive changes for 
      caregivers of young adults with psychosis. Using photovoice, we collected 
      qualitative data to help develop a unique contextual understanding of MBFPE 
      program outcomes and generate novel ideas, insights, suggestions, and questions 
      on the basis of participant's perceptions. Participants in our pilot study and 
      randomized controlled study of MBFPE were invited to participate in this 
      photovoice activity. On the basis of a procedure developed for MBFPE, caregivers 
      were invited to use photographs to express how mindfulness contributed to 
      caregivers' management of their caregiving stress and burden. Caregiver's inquiry 
      with the MBFPE instructors were transcribed for analysis together with the 
      photographs. A grounded theory approach was adopted to analyze the photovoice 
      images, participants' reflections, and inquiries of photographs. Six themes were 
      developed in understanding the lived experience of caregivers in participation of 
      MBFPE: (1) I pay attention to the present moment; (2) I care about my family; (3) 
      I trust my children; (4) I appreciate the connection with and support from nature 
      and the universe; (5) I observe my worries and guilt and learn not to be 
      reactive; and (6) I find space in offering care and exercising self-care. The 
      application of photovoice can offer an additional approach to enhance the 
      awareness and insights of participants in a mindfulness-based program. Specific 
      guidelines may be developed to enhance the learning of participants.

AB  - Mindfulness-based interventions have previously been shown to have positive 
      effects on psychological well-being. However, the time commitment, teacher 
      shortage, and high cost of classic mindfulness interventions may have hindered 
      efforts to spread the associated benefits to individuals in developing countries. 
      Brief mindfulness meditation (BMM) has recently received attention as a way to 
      disseminate the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions. Most existing BMM 
      methods are adaptations of the classic approach. Few studies have investigated 
      the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of BMM. We developed a 15-min 
      BMM named JW2016, which is based on the core concepts of mindfulness, Anapanasati 
      (breath meditation of Buddhist Vipassana), our practical experience, and the 
      results of scientific reports on meditation. We investigated the effects of this 
      BMM on mood and emotion processing in an effort to create an effective, 
      convenient, safe, and standardized BMM method that could benefit individuals with 
      limited time or money to devote to meditation. Forty-six healthy participants 
      (aged 18-25 years) were randomly allocated to the BMM group (n = 23) or the 
      emotional regulation education (ERE) control group (n = 23). Forty-two of the 
      study participants cooperated fully in all measurements and interventions (one 
      time daily for seven consecutive days). Mood was measured with the Centre for 
      Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) and the State Anxiety Inventory 
      (SAI). Emotion processing was evaluated by assessing performance on an emotion 
      intensity task, an emotional memory task, and an emotional dot-probe task. After 
      intervention, the BMM group, but not the ERE group, showed a significant 
      decreases in emotional intensity in response to positive as well as negative 
      emotional stimuli, response time for emotional memory, and duration of attention 
      bias toward negative emotional stimuli. Negative effects on mood state were found 
      in the ERE group but not in the BMM group. This study demonstrated that BMM may 
      improve aspects of emotion processing such as emotion intensity, emotional 
      memory, and emotional attention bias. JW2016 BMM may be an effective, convenient, 
      safe and standardized way to help practitioners remain focused and peaceful 
      without any negative effect on emotion.

TI  - Formal mindfulness practice predicts reductions in PTSD symptom severity 
      following a mindfulness-based intervention for women with co-occurring PTSD and 
      substance use disorder.
PG  - 51

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 
      substance use disorder (SUD) experience systemic barriers that place them in 
      danger of poorer treatment outcomes. Some mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) 
      have demonstrated efficacy in reducing PTSD and SUD symptoms. Mindfulness 
      practice is a core component of MBIs, thought to elicit and maintain positive 
      behavioral change; however, no research to our knowledge has assessed the role of 
      mindfulness practice on sustained treatment gains among women with co-occurring 
      PTSD-SUD. Such research is necessary to better inform MBIs for dually diagnosed 
      women. METHODS: This secondary analysis assessed whether post-intervention formal 
      and informal mindfulness practice predicted reductions in PTSD symptoms and 
      substance craving 6 months following an 8-session mindfulness-based relapse 
      prevention intervention for women diagnosed with co-occurring PTSD-SUD (N = 23). 
      Data were derived from a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the 
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a trauma-integrated mindfulness-based 
      relapse prevention program for women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD. RESULTS: Greater 
      duration of formal mindfulness practice (i.e., minutes per practice) predicted 
      reduced total PTSD symptoms ([Formula: see text] = - .670, p < .00), 
      trauma-related avoidance ([Formula: see text] = - .564, p = .01), arousal and 
      reactivity ([Formula: see text] = - .530, p = .02), and negative cognitions and 
      mood ([Formula: see text] = - .780, p < .01) six months following treatment. 
      Informal practice did not predict any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This research 
      highlights the potential role of formal mindfulness practice in sustaining 
      reductions in PTSD symptoms over time among women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD. 
      Further study of strategies to promote ongoing formal mindfulness practice in 
      this population following a MBI are warranted. Trial registration The parent 
      trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03505749).

TI  - Adaptation and virtual feasibility pilot of a mindfulness-based lifestyle program 
      targeting modifiable dementia risk factors in older adults.
PG  - 695-707

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We developed a group-based program (My Healthy Brain, MHB) to engage 
      older adults at-risk for dementia in healthy lifestyles. We report on a two-part 
      study to adapt MHB by incorporating mindfulness skills, using mobile health 
      technology to monitor and reinforce behaviors, and delivering it via live video. 
      METHODS: Participants were older adults (age ≥ 60) with subjective cognitive 
      decline (SCD) and at least one lifestyle risk factor. In Aim 1 (n = 11, 2 
      groups), we conducted focus groups to obtain qualitative feedback on proposed 
      adaptations. In Aim 2 (n = 10), we conducted a virtual open pilot with exit 
      interviews to explore the feasibility and outcomes of the adapted MHB. RESULTS: 
      Thematic analysis revealed: (1) barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyles, 
      (2) positive impressions of MHB, (3) interest in mindfulness skills, and (4) 
      openness to study technologies. MHB met a-priori feasibility benchmarks and was 
      associated with improvements in cognition, lifestyle (e.g. physical function), 
      and proposed mechanisms (e.g. mindfulness). Exit interviews confirmed high 
      feasibility and satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The integration of mindfulness, live 
      video, and mobile health technologies was feasible and promising for improving 
      healthier lifestyles. The results inform the next feasibility RCT of MHB to 
      prepare for efficacy testing. Supplemental data for this article is available

TI  - Cognitive-affective changes mediate the mindfulness-based intervention effect on 
      endometriosis-related pain and mental health: A path analysis approach.
PG  - 1187-1202
LID - 10.1002/ejp.2149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is poor knowledge about the therapeutic mechanisms of the 
      conservative interventions for endometriosis. We hypothesized that the effects of 
      a brief mindfulness-based intervention (bMBI) on pelvic pain intensity (PPI), 
      pain unpleasantness (PU) and quality of life mental health (QoL-MH) are mediated 
      by direct and indirect paths of changes in pain catastrophizing (PC), positive 
      affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). METHODS: A secondary analysis of a pilot 
      randomized controlled trial of women with endometriosis, assigned to standard 
      medical treatment (n = 32) and standard medical treatment plus bMBI (n = 31). We 
      tested a series of parallel and serial mediators (PC, PA and NA) of the 
      relationship between bMBI and outcomes (PPI, PU and QoL-MH). RESULTS: The bMBI 
      group demonstrated improvement in PA (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.12 [0.01, 0.36]), 
      decreases in NA (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.06 [0.00, 0.24]) and PC (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.16 
      [0.02, 0.42]). The PC reduction mediated the effect of the bMBI on PPI and PU 
      directly; however, the PC effect through PA increase mediated the PU marginally 
      but not PPI changes. bMBI effect on Qol-MH was mediated directly by PA and NA. 
      The PC improved Qol-MH through PA increase and Pain decrease but not via NA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that bMBI impacts pain through changes in 
      pain-related cognitive-affective factors. bMBI can improve QoL-MH by multiple 
      pathways, including but not limited to pain reduction, highlighting the 
      independent potential of improvement in affect to restore mental health in 
      endometriosis. SIGNIFICANCE: Brief mindfulness-based intervention improves 
      endometriosis pain through pain-related cognitive-affective factors and quality 
      of life mental health via pain and affect changes unrelated to pain.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss Intervention on 
      Cardiovascular Reactivity to Social-Evaluative Threat Among Adults with Obesity.
PG  - 2583-2595
LID - 10.1007/s12671-019-01232-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions have been found to reduce 
      psychological and physiological stress reactivity. In obesity, however, stress 
      reactivity is complex, with studies showing both exaggerated and blunted 
      physiological responses to stressors. A nuanced view of stress reactivity is the 
      "challenge and threat" framework, which defines adaptive and maladaptive patterns 
      of psychophysiological stress reactivity. We hypothesized that mindfulness 
      training would facilitate increased challenge-related appraisals, emotions, and 
      cardiovascular reactivity, including sympathetic nervous system activation paired 
      with increased cardiac output (CO) and reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR) 
      compared to a control group, which would exhibit an increased threat pattern of 
      psychophysiological reactivity to repeated stressors. METHODS: Adults (N=194) 
      with obesity were randomized to a 5.5-month mindfulness-based weight loss 
      intervention or an active control condition with identical diet-exercise 
      guidelines. Participants were assessed at baseline and 4.5 months later using the 
      Trier Social Stress Task. Electrocardiogram, impedance cardiography, and blood 
      pressure were acquired at rest and during the speech and verbal arithmetic tasks 
      to assess pre-ejection period (PEP), CO, and TPR reactivity. RESULTS: Mindfulness 
      participants showed significantly greater maintenance of challenge-related 
      emotions and cardiovascular reactivity patterns (higher CO and lower TPR) from 
      pre to post-intervention compared to control participants, but groups did not 
      differ in PEP. Findings were independent of changes in body mass index. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness training may increase the ability to maintain a positive 
      outlook and mount adaptive cardiovascular responses to repeated stressors among 
      persons with obesity though findings need to be replicated in other populations 
      and using other forms of mindfulness interventions.

TI  - A Brief Mindfulness-Based Family Psychoeducation Intervention for Chinese Young 
      Adults With First Episode Psychosis: A Study Protocol.
PG  - 516

LID - 516
AB  - Family psychoeducation (FPE) has been recommended as a major component in the 
      treatment of psychosis. Many previous studies have implemented an intensive 
      program design that often only emphasized improvements in patients' illness 
      outcomes but the benefits for caregivers were limited. There have been calls for 
      a time-limited but cost-effective FPE program to mitigate the looming reality of 
      the suffering of people with psychosis and their families. A Brief 
      Mindfulness-Based Family Psychoeducation for psychosis program is developed to 
      reduce caregivers' burden and promote young adult's recovery. A randomized 
      controlled trial will be conducted to compare this intervention with an ordinary 
      FPE intervention. Both arms will involve six sessions, with a total contact time 
      of 12 h. 300 caregivers of young adults who have experienced first episode 
      psychosis within last 3 years will be recruited. Program effectiveness will be 
      assessed by comparing outcomes measuring the caregivers' burden, mental health 
      symptoms, positive well-being, and the young adult's mental health symptoms 
      during the study and at 9-month post-randomization. The role of expressed 
      emotions, interpersonal mindfulness, and non-attachment in mediating these 
      outcomes will be explored. An additional qualitative approach Photovoice is 
      selected to explore the complex family experiences and the benefits of 
      mindfulness from the caregivers' personal perspectives. Trial Registration: The 
      trial is registered with the United States Clinical Trials Registry 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT03688009.

TI  - Task shifting eating disorders prevention: A pilot study of selective 
      interventions adapted for teacher-led universal delivery in secondary schools.
PG  - 327-340
LID - 10.1002/eat.24100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Increasing effectiveness and sustainability of universal school-based 
      eating disorder prevention is needed. This study adapted two existing selective 
      prevention programmes for universal delivery, investigating feasibility, 
      acceptability, and preliminary effects when delivered by trained teachers to 
      classes of mixed-gender adolescents. METHOD: A three-arm controlled pilot study 
      with Year 9 students (N = 288; M(age)  = 13.61 SD(age)  = .50). Three schools in 
      south Wales and south-west England were allocated to mindfulness-based 
      intervention (MBI), dissonance-based intervention (DBI), or classes-as-usual 
      (CAU) control. Self-reported eating disorder risk factors were collected at 
      baseline, 6-week post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up. Focus groups were 
      conducted post-intervention. RESULTS: Delivery and evaluation were feasible, 
      allowing for flexibility in scheduling, with good retention. Student and teacher 
      ratings indicated moderate acceptability of both interventions, with 
      recommendations for refinement. Mixed model analyses, controlling for baseline, 
      showed significant effects of condition across post-intervention and follow-up 
      for body esteem (DBI > CAU; Cohen's d = .34) and positive affect (MBI > CAU, 
      d = .58). For girls only, both MBI and DBI improved body satisfaction and 
      internalization, and the MBI additionally resulted in improved weight and shape 
      concerns, negative affect, and life disengagement (d's = .39-1.12), across 
      post-intervention and follow-up. DISCUSSION: Selective eating disorder prevention 
      programmes based on cognitive dissonance and mindfulness can be delivered 
      universally in schools, by teachers, allowing for appropriate flexibility 
      necessary for real world implementation. Moderate acceptability indicates areas 
      for improving content and delivery; positive effects on key outcomes are 
      encouraging. These findings provide support for further robust evaluation. PUBLIC 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Existing universal eating disorder prevention is limited by small 
      effects and reliance on highly trained facilitators. This study is the first to 
      adapt mindfulness- and dissonance-based interventions for delivery by teachers, 
      to adolescents of all genders in a classroom setting. Delivery was largely 
      feasible and acceptable, and both interventions showed significant effects across 
      key risk factors for eating disorders, with larger effect sizes than found 
      previously. This underpins further robust evaluation.

TI  - Mindfulness training selectively reduces altruistic behaviour in low-cost 
      situations.
PG  - 272-281
LID - 10.1002/ijop.12893 [doi]
AB  - There have been rich debates about whether and how mindfulness alters prosocial 
      behaviour. Nevertheless, few empirical studies have touched on how mindfulness 
      training (MT) influences altruistic behaviour under high- and low-cost situations 
      in a real-life scenario. The present study aimed to examine the effect of 
      mindfulness training on altruistic willingness at different cost levels. A total 
      of 41 females participated in our study and were randomly assigned to the MT and 
      control groups. They completed the empathy-altruism task and Five-Facet 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) before and after an 8-week experimental 
      intervention, during which the MT group attended the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
      Therapy (MBCT) programme, while the control group remained as usual. The MT group 
      presented a significant increase in overall FFMQ scores after the 8 weeks of 
      MBCT. However, their willingness to help declined in the low-cost situation at 
      post-test. Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between the increase 
      in the scores of the observing facet and willingness to help in the high-cost 
      situation in the MT group. The changes in describing facet were a negative 
      predictor of the change in empathy in the low-cost situation. Taken together, 
      8-week MBCT enhanced the level of mindfulness but reduced people's willingness to 
      help in the low-cost situation.

AB  - Social distancing, home confinement, economic challenges, and COVID-19-related 
      illness and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly affect mental 
      health in youth. One promising approach to reduce anxiety and depression in 
      adolescents is the neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention Training for 
      Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA). The objective of this individually 
      randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) was (1) to test the feasibility of 
      TARA, delivered partially over Zoom, and (2) to assess changes in the emotional 
      wellbeing in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14-18 years old during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy adolescents were randomized to the 
      TARA intervention or to the waitlist control group in February 2020, just before 
      the start of the pandemic. The TARA group intervention was delivered in person 
      for the first five sessions and remotely over Zoom for the remaining seven 
      sessions due to the pandemic. The participants' acceptability of TARA was 
      assessed weekly using the Child Session Rating Scale (CSRS). The primary outcome 
      was the emotional wellbeing measured using emotional symptoms subscale of the 
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) pre/post-TARA. We also explored 
      weekly changes in TARA participants' wellbeing using the Child Outcome Rating 
      Scale (CORS). RESULTS: The overall session rating in TARA participants improved 
      after the switch to Zoom (Cohen's d = 1.2, p = 0.008). The results of the two-way 
      ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in the change of the SDQ 
      emotional symptoms during the 12 weeks between the TARA group and 
      waitlist-control group (timepoint × group interaction: F = 0.77, p = 0.38). The 
      exploratory analysis using the CORS in the TARA participants showed a significant 
      improvement in their functioning over the weeks of training. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results support the feasibility of TARA delivered over Zoom. While our primary 
      outcome did not provide support for the improvement of the emotional wellbeing 
      with TARA compared to a passive control group, our exploratory analysis in the 
      intervention group indicated an improved functioning over the weeks of TARA 
      training. The important general positive impact of this study lies in the 
      possibility of offering a neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention remotely to 
      youth living in remote areas and for all youth during pandemic times.

      Nonclinical Dutch Population: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e32123

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has become increasingly popular, and positive outcomes 
      have been reported for mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in reducing stress. 
      These findings make room for innovative perspectives on how MBIs could be 
      applied, for instance through mobile health (mHealth). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study is to investigate whether a nonguided mindfulness mobile app can decrease 
      perceived stress in a nonclinical Dutch population over the course of 8 weeks, 
      with follow-up at 6 months. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed 
      to compare an experimental group that made use of a structured 8-week mHealth 
      mindfulness program and a control group after 8 weeks, with follow-up after 6 
      months. Participants were recruited via a national television program. The 
      primary outcome measure was perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress 
      Scale, secondary outcomes were symptoms of burnout (measured using the visual 
      analog scale [VAS]) and psychological symptoms (measured using the 
      Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire [4DSQ] at follow-up). Outcomes were 
      analyzed using a multilevel regression model. RESULTS: At baseline, 587 
      respondents were included. Results showed no postintervention differences between 
      groups for the level of perceived stress. With regard to the secondary outcome 
      measures, the VAS for emotional exhaustion and physical exhaustion showed 
      significantly lower scores for the experimental group after 8 weeks (P=.04 and 
      P=.01, respectively), but not at follow-up. There were no differences between 
      groups for psychological symptoms measured using the 4DSQ. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings do not support our hypothesis that using the mindfulness app would 
      reduce stress levels. However, our findings related to diminished exhaustion at 8 
      weeks are encouraging and require further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effectiveness and Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for School Teachers in 
      Difficult Times: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2820-2831
LID - 10.1007/s12671-021-01750-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Research in recent years has shown that mindfulness-based 
      interventions can enhance teachers' mental and physical health. However, the 
      existing studies were predominantly conducted in Western, educated, 
      industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies. As a randomized 
      controlled trial in a non-WEIRD society, the present study examined the 
      effectiveness and mechanisms of mindfulness training for Hong Kong teachers in 
      difficult times. METHODS: Teachers from primary and secondary schools (n = 186) 
      were randomly assigned to mindfulness training (eight-week .b Foundations) or 
      waitlist control condition. They completed online self-report surveys on measures 
      of well-being, emotion management, and mindfulness in teaching at baseline, 
      post-intervention, and two-month follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention group 
      reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction, positive affect, 
      general health, along with significantly lower levels of insomnia, stress, and 
      negative affect than the control group at post-test and two-month follow-up. The 
      effect sizes were medium to large (η (p) (2) = 0.06 to 0.14). More importantly, 
      teachers' baseline well-being had a significant moderating effect on the 
      intervention effectiveness. Those with a lower baseline in well-being benefitted 
      more than their counterparts with a higher baseline. In addition, teachers' 
      emotion management was found to be the mediator through which mindfulness 
      training enhanced teachers' well-being. Such improvement in well-being also 
      predicted higher levels of mindfulness in teaching. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      provides evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness training for teachers beyond 
      WEIRD societies. It suggests the universality and practicality of mindfulness 
      training in enhancing teachers' well-being and reducing their distress in 
      difficult times.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Humor has been described as an effective coping strategy for 
      dealing with chronic pain conditions; likewise, coping strategies predict some 
      clinical outcomes after cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based 
      interventions. The present study aims to preliminarily explore the role of humor 
      styles in predicting clinical changes after the multicomponent intervention 
      (MINDSET) that combines mindfulness and psychoeducation for fibromyalgia (FM) 
      patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A subsample of 35 patients with FM of the 
      EUDAIMON study, a randomized controlled trial, was used for the present study; 
      linear regressions and Spearman's correlations were computed. RESULTS: 
      Affiliative humor and positive/negative ratio humor styles had a unique 
      predictive effect on self-reported clinical changes. Significant correlations 
      between humor styles with functional impact and mindfulness facets were observed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Some humor styles may imply a better disposition in patients to 
      learn and implement the concepts and resources that the intervention offered.

TI  - Analyzing the Impact of Mobile App Engagement on Mental Health Outcomes: 
      Secondary Analysis of the Unwinding Anxiety Program.
PG  - e33696
LID - 10.2196/33696 [doi]
LID - e33696
AB  - BACKGROUND: App-based interventions provide a promising avenue for mitigating the 
      burden on mental health services by complimenting therapist-led treatments for 
      anxiety. However, it remains unclear how specific systems' use of app features 
      may be associated with changes in mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety and worry). 
      OBJECTIVE: This study was a secondary analysis of engagement data from a stage 1 
      randomized controlled trial testing the impact of the Unwinding Anxiety mobile 
      app among adults with generalized anxiety disorder. The aims of this study were 
      2-fold: to investigate whether higher microengagement with the primary 
      intervention feature (ie, educational modules) is associated with positive 
      changes in mental health outcomes at 2 months (ie, anxiety, worry, interoceptive 
      awareness, and emotional reactivity) and to investigate whether the use of 
      adjunctive app features is also associated with changes in mental health 
      outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the intervention group during the stage 1 trial of 
      the Unwinding Anxiety mobile app. The total use of specific mobile app features 
      and the use specific to each feature were calculated. We used multivariate linear 
      models with a priori significance of α=.05 to investigate the impact of 
      cumulative app use on anxiety, worry, interoceptive awareness, and emotional 
      regulation at 2 months, controlling for baseline scores, age, and education level 
      in all models. Significant relationships between system use metrics and baseline 
      participant characteristics were assessed for differences in use groupings using 
      between-group testing (ie, 2-tailed t tests for continuous data and chi-square 
      analyses for categorical data). RESULTS: The sample was primarily female (25/27, 
      93%), and the average age was 42.9 (SD 15.6) years. Educational module 
      completion, the central intervention component, averaged 20.2 (SD 11.4) modules 
      out of 32 for the total sample. Multivariate models revealed that completing >75% 
      of the program was associated with an average 22.6-point increase in 
      interoceptive awareness (b=22.6; SE 8.32; P=.01; 95% CI 5.3-39.8) and an 
      11.6-point decrease in worry (b=-11.6; SE 4.12; P=.01; 95% CI -20.2 to -3.1). In 
      addition, a single log unit change in the total number of meditations was 
      associated with a 0.62-point reduction in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
      scale scores (b=0.62; SE 0.27; P=.005; 95% CI -1.2 to -0.6), whereas a single log 
      unit use of the stress meter was associated with an average of a 0.5-point 
      increase in emotional regulation scores (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; 
      b=0.5; SE 0.21; P=.03; 95% CI 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a clearer 
      understanding of the impact of engagement with app features on broader engagement 
      with the health outcomes of interest. This study highlights the importance of 
      comprehensive investigations of engagement during the development of 
      evidence-based mobile apps.

TI  - Mindfulness Improves Otolaryngology Residents' Performance in a Simulated 
      Bad-News Consultation: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 1357-1365
LID - S1931-7204(20)30434-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.11.009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delivering bad news is a stressful moment for both patient and 
      clinician. As poor bad-news consultation quality may lead to misunderstandings, 
      lack of treatment adherence, acute or even post-traumatic stress in patients, 
      training interventions to improve communication skills and stress-management are 
      necessary. Mindfulness is a recognised stress-management strategy that has shown 
      its efficacy in reducing stress in both health professionals and students. We 
      then supposed that a short mindfulness meditation session performed just before a 
      simulated breaking bad-news consultation to patients with laryngeal cancer may 
      help ear, nose and throat (ENT) residents to master their stress and improve 
      their management of this consultation. This study aims at showing how a short 
      mindfulness meditation performed before a simulated bad-news consultation may 
      improve performance in its realisation by ENT residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We enrolled 53 ENT residents, randomised in 2 groups. The first group completed a 
      5-minute mindfulness session while the other group listened to a control track. 
      Thereafter, every resident completed an 8-minute simulated bad-news consultation 
      with a standardised patient. Two blinded expert assessors evaluated their 
      performance on a 25-point grid (BNC-OSAS). Residents self-assessed their stress 
      before and after the intervention and simulated patients rated their perception 
      of physician's empathy. RESULTS: The performance was significantly better in the 
      mindfulness group than in the control group (m = 19.8, sd = 3.2 and m = 17.4, 
      sd = 3.7 respectively, F(1,45)=5.27, p = 0.026, d = 0.67), especially in the 
      communication and knowledge subdomains. There was no significant difference in 
      perceived stress between the 2 groups. Empathy perceived by simulated patients 
      was positively correlated to residents' performance. CONCLUSION: A short 
      mindfulness meditation is effective for improving ENT residents' performance in a 
      simulated bad-news consultation. These results encourage further assessments of 
      this method with objective measures of physiological stress. More research is 
      required concerning the feasibility and efficacy of mindfulness before daily 
      clinical activities such as stressing bad-news consultation.

PG  - 100979
LID - 10.1016/j.imr.2023.100979 [doi]
LID - 100979
AB  - BACKGROUND: This project aimed to assess the impact of yoga on stress, metabolic 
      parameters and cognition (attention & concentration) in adolescents, aged 13-15 
      years from public and private schools in two cities (Chennai and New Delhi) in 
      India. METHODS: The study recruited 2000 adolescents from 24 schools in a cluster 
      randomized controlled trial design. The yoga group participants underwent 17 yoga 
      sessions, which included: pranayama, basic asanas, meditation and relaxation 
      exercises. Yoga sessions, were held in the school premises once a week. A total 
      of five awareness talks on healthy lifestyle were delivered once a month to the 
      education group. ADOlescence Stress Scale (ADOSS), salivary cortisol, metabolic 
      and clinical parameters and Letter Cancellation Test (LCT) score were measured at 
      baseline and post-intervention (5-6 months). RESULTS: The yoga group showed 
      statistically significant differences in the mean ADOSS score, metabolic 
      parameters, salivary cortisol, and LCT scores compared to the education group. In 
      the intention- to- treat analysis, a significant reduction [5.11, 95% CI (4.78, 
      5.36), p = 0.001] in ADOSS score was seen in the yoga group compared to 
      education. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a 17-week standardized yoga program at 
      the school level significantly decreased stress, improved attention and 
      concentration, metabolic and clinical parameters in Indian adolescents. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a growing interest in evaluating the effectiveness of 
      compassion interventions for treating psychological disorders. The present study 
      evaluated the effectiveness of "attachment-based compassion therapy" (ABCT) in 
      the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM), and the role of psychological flexibility as 
      a mediator of improvements. METHODS: A total of 42 patients with FM were randomly 
      assigned to ABCT or relaxation (active control group). Both the intervention and 
      control condition were combined with treatment as usual (TAU). The primary 
      outcome was functional status (FIQ), and the secondary outcomes were clinical 
      severity (CGI-S), pain catastrophizing (PCS), anxiety (HADS-A), depression 
      (HADS-D), quality of life (EQ-5D), and psychological flexibility (AAQ-II). 
      Differences between the groups were estimated using mixed-effects models, and 
      mediation assessments were conducted using path analyses. RESULTS: The ABCT group 
      demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the relaxation group, including better 
      FIQ values after treatment (B = -3.01; p = 0.003). Differences in FIQ were 
      maintained at 3-month follow-up (B = -3.33; p = 0.001). The absolute risk 
      reduction in ABCT compared to relaxation increased by 40.0%, with an NNT = 3 
      based on criteria of ≥50% FIQ reduction after treatment. Psychological 
      flexibility had a significant mediating effect on improvements. CONCLUSION: These 
      results suggest that ABCT combined with TAU appears to be effective in the 
      treatment of FM symptoms. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://ClinicalTrials.gov,

TI  - Stress Reduction by Yoga versus Mindfulness Training in Adults Suffering from 
      Distress: A Three-Armed Randomized Controlled Trial including Qualitative 
      Interviews (RELAX Study).

LID - 5680
AB  - Distress is a growing public health concern. In this three-armed randomized 
      controlled trial, n = 102 adults with elevated stress levels and stress-related 
      symptoms were randomly assigned to (1) “integrative” yoga classes which combined 
      physical exercises, mindfulness training, and ethical/philosophical aspects of 
      traditional yoga; to (2) Iyengar yoga classes which entailed primarily physical 
      exercises; or to (3) mindfulness training without physical training. We 
      hypothesized the synergistic effects of physical yoga exercises, mindfulness, and 
      ethical/philosophical aspects. The primary outcome was the group difference on 
      Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included 
      burnout, quality of life, physical complaints, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, 
      interoceptive awareness, self-regulation, spirituality, mysticism, and 
      posttraumatic stress. All outcomes were evaluated at baseline (V0), after 12 
      weeks (V1), and after 24 weeks (V2). A subset of participants took part in 
      qualitative interviews. A lasting and clinically relevant stress reduction was 
      observed within all groups (PSS ΔV0−V1Integrative Yoga = −6.69 ± 6.19; 
      ΔV0−V1Iyengar Yoga = −6.00 ± 7.37; ΔV0−V1Mindfulness = −9.74 ± 7.80; all p < 
      0.00). Effect sizes were also statistically large at the end of the follow-up 
      period (Cohen’s d Integrative Yoga = 1.41; d Iyengar Yoga = 1.37; d Mindfulness = 
      1.23). There were no significant group differences or evidence of relevant 
      synergistic effects from combining mindfulness and physical yoga exercises. All 
      three interventions were found to be equally effective methods of stress 
      reduction. Their use in practice should be based on availability and patient 
      preference.

TI  - Effects of a Social Media-Based Mind-Body Intervention Embedded With Acupressure 
      and Mindfulness for Stress Reduction Among Family Caregivers of Frail Older 
      Adults: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e42861
LID - 10.2196/42861 [doi]
LID - e42861
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of frail older adults experience high levels of 
      stress. Mind-body interventions (MBIs) focused on caregiver stress are often 
      limited in teaching approaches, difficult to practice, and costly. A social 
      media-based MBI embedded with mindfulness meditation (MM) and self-administered 
      acupressure (SA) may be effective for family caregivers, offer greater usability, 
      and lead to greater adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the 
      feasibility and preliminary effects of a social media-based MBI embedded with MM 
      and SA on family caregivers of frail older adults and to investigate the 
      preliminary effects of the intervention using a pilot randomized controlled 
      trial. METHODS: A 2-arm randomized controlled trial design was adopted. Family 
      caregivers of frail older adults (n=64) were randomized into either the 
      intervention group (n=32), receiving 8 weeks of social media-based MM and SA, or 
      the control group (n=32), receiving brief education on caregiving for people with 
      frailty. The primary outcome (caregiver stress) and secondary outcomes (caregiver 
      burden, sleep quality, and mindfulness awareness and attention) were measured 
      using a web-based survey at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention 
      (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: The feasibility of the 
      intervention was established with a high attendance rate (87.5%), high usability 
      score (79), and low attrition rate (1.6%). The generalized estimating equation 
      results showed that participants in the intervention group at T1 and T2 
      experienced a significant improvement in stress reduction (P=.02 and P=.04, 
      respectively), sleep quality (P=.004 and P=.01, respectively), and mindful 
      awareness and attention (P=.006 and P=.02, respectively) compared with the 
      control group. There were no substantial improvements in caregiver burden at T1 
      and T2 (P=.59 and P=.47, respectively). A focus group session conducted after the 
      intervention had 5 themes: impact on the family caregivers, difficulty in 
      practicing the intervention, the strength of the program, the limitations of the 
      program, and perception of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support 
      the feasibility and preliminary effects of social media-based MBI embedded with 
      acupressure and MM on reducing stress among family caregivers of frail older 
      people and enhancing sleep quality and mindfulness levels. A future study with a 
      larger and more diverse sample is proposed to evaluate the longer-term effects 
      and generalizability of the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical

TI  - Altered self-reported resting state mediates the effects of Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction on mental health: a longitudinal path model analysis within a 
      community-based randomized trial with 6-months follow-up.
PG  - 1154277

LID - 1154277
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large body of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that 
      mindfulness-based interventions are effective for improving mental health, but 
      research is lacking in regards to the mechanisms of change. We aimed to 
      investigate the mediating effects of self-reported altered resting state of 
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on mental health, when provided as a 
      universal intervention in a real-life context. METHODS: Autoregressive path 
      models with three time points of measurement, and contemporaneous and constant b 
      paths were used in an RCT. The RCT took place in all five geographical regions of 
      Denmark and included 110 schools and 191 schoolteachers. The schools were 
      randomized 1:1 in each geographical region to intervention or a wait-list control 
      group. The intervention was the standardized MBSR. Data were collected at 
      baseline and after 3 and 6  months. The outcomes were perceived stress, measured 
      by Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), symptoms of anxiety and depression, 
      measured by Hopkins Symptom Check List-5 (SCL-5), and well-being measured by 
      WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5). The mediator was resting state measured by the 
      Amsterdam Resting State Questionnaire (ARSQ). RESULTS: Statistically significant 
      mediated effects of altered ARSQ-subscales scores for Discontinuity of Mind, 
      Planning, and Comfort were found for the MBSR effect on all outcomes; PSS, SCL-5 
      and WHO-5. Furthermore, statistically significant mediated effects of altered 
      sleepiness subscale score of the effects on PSS and SCL-5 of MBSR were found. No 
      statistically significant mediating effects of the subscales Theory of Mind, Self 
      and Somatic Awareness for the MBSR intervention effect were found. CONCLUSION: 
      The results support that the MBSR program can alter self-reported resting state, 
      towards less mind wandering and more comfort, measured by the ARSQ, and that this 
      may explain some of the mechanisms regarding the effectiveness of MBSR on mental 
      health at 6 months, when provided as a universal intervention. The study provides 
      insight into an active ingredient of how MBSR may improve mental health and 
      well-being. It supports the suggestions that mindfulness meditation may be a 
      sustainable way of training the mental health.Clinical trial

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training (MT) includes a variety of contemplative 
      practices aimed at promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with 
      attitudes of nonjudgment and curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, 
      manualized group interventions, MT has been implemented in a variety of 
      modalities, including smartphone apps that seek to replicate the success of group 
      interventions. However, although smartphone apps are scalable and accessible to a 
      wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely untested. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to investigate a newly developed MT app called Wildflowers, 
      which was codeveloped with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It was 
      hypothesized that 3 weeks of MT through this app would improve subjective 
      well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with 
      weaker effects than those published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention 
      literature. METHODS: Undergraduate students completed 3 weeks of MT with 
      Wildflowers (n=45) or 3 weeks of cognitive training with a game called 2048 
      (n=41). State training effects were assessed through pre- and postsession ratings 
      of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait training effects were 
      assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing subjective 
      well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and interoceptive 
      integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a multilevel model 
      using emergent latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness) to summarize 
      the trait questionnaire battery. RESULTS: Analyses revealed both state and trait 
      effects specific to MT; participants engaging in MT demonstrated improved mood 
      (r=.14) and a reduction of stress (r=-.13) immediately after each training 
      session compared with before the training session and decreased postsession 
      stress over 3 weeks (r=-.08). In addition, MT relative to cognitive training 
      resulted in greater improvements in attentional control (r=-.24). Interestingly, 
      both groups demonstrated increased subjective ratings of awareness (r=.28) and 
      acceptance (r=.23) from pre- to postintervention, with greater changes in 
      acceptance for the MT group trending (r=.21). CONCLUSIONS: MT, using a smartphone 
      app, may provide immediate effects on mood and stress while also providing 
      long-term benefits for attentional control. Although further investigation is 
      warranted, there is evidence that with continued usage, MT via a smartphone app 
      may provide long-term benefits in changing how one relates to their inner and 
      outer experiences. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effects of a Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss Intervention on Long-Term 
      Psychological Well-Being Among Adults with Obesity: Secondary Analyses from the 
      Supporting Health by Integrating Nutrition and Exercise (SHINE) Trial.
PG  - 2227-2242

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested whether a mindfulness-based intervention for obesity 
      that included components aimed at emotion regulation and mindful eating improved 
      psychological outcomes including stress, anxiety, positive emotion, and 
      depression, during the intervention period and at longer-term follow-up. METHODS: 
      Adults with obesity (N=194) were randomized to a 5.5-month diet-exercise weight 
      loss intervention with or without mindfulness training focused on emotion 
      regulation and mindful eating. Participants completed self-report measures of 
      mindfulness and psychological well-being, which were planned secondary outcomes, 
      at baseline, mid-intervention (3 months), and at 6-, 12-, and 18-months 
      post-baseline (maintenance period). Mixed effects models and linear regression 
      were used to test between- and within-group changes in psychological well-being. 
      Finally, this study explored whether changes in mindfulness (from baseline to 
      each 6- and 18-months post-baseline) mediated the effects of intervention arm on 
      changes in psychological outcomes during those respective time periods. This 
      study explored whether changes in mindfulness from baseline to 6 months mediated 
      the effects of intervention arm on changes in psychological outcomes from 
      baseline to 18 months. RESULTS: Participants randomized to the mindfulness arm 
      had significant increases in positive emotions at all follow-up times compared to 
      controls. There were statistically significant increases in mindfulness, 
      psychological flexibility, and reflection, as well as decreases in anxiety and 
      depressive symptoms at 12 months compared to control participants. These changes 
      remained significant for psychological flexibility and reflection at 18 months. 
      There were no significant differences in perceived stress. Among mindfulness 
      participants, greater increases in mindfulness from 6-18 months was associated 
      with greater positive emotions and psychological flexibility as well as lower 
      perceived stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and rumination at 18 months, 
      adjusting for 6-month values. Mediation analyses indicated that randomization to 
      the mindfulness intervention arm was associated with 6-month increases in 
      mindfulness, and these increases were in turn associated with improved 
      psychological outcomes at 6 months and 18 months. Changes from baseline to 18 
      months did not mediate 18-month changes in psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Mindfulness training in emotion regulation and mindful eating may provide greater 
      longer-term psychological well-being benefits in non-clinical populations with 
      obesity compared to conventional diet-exercise interventions.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating condition 
      that is often refractory to standard frontline antidepressant therapy. A 
      promising new approach to PTSD therapy is administration of a single 
      sub-anesthetic dose of (R,S)-ketamine (Ket). The treatment produces rapid and 
      significant therapeutic response, which lasts for only 4-7 days. In one of our 
      studies, the mean duration of response was increased to 33 days when Ket 
      administration was combined with a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, Trauma 
      Interventions using Mindfulness Based Extinction and Reconsolidation (TIMBER). We 
      now report the results from a 20-patient study, which examined the duration of 
      sustained response with combined TIMBER-Ket therapy, TIMBER-K arm, relative to 
      the response observed in a placebo-controlled arm, TIMBER-P. A significant 
      difference in the duration of response was observed between TIMBER-K and TIMBER-P 
      arms: 34.44 ± 19.12 days and 16.50 ± 11.39 days, respectively (p = 0.022). 
      Previous studies identified a negative correlation between antidepressant 
      response to Ket and basal plasma concentrations of d-serine (DSR). In this study, 
      the basal DSR levels positively correlated with the pre-treatment severity of 
      PTSD symptoms (Pearson's r = 0.42, p = 0.07) and patients with basal DSR 
      level ≥ 3.5 μM displayed not only higher PTSD severity but also shorter duration 
      of response. The data indicate that basal DSR levels may serve as a biomarker of 
      the severity of PTSD symptoms and as a predictor of clinical response. This

TI  - Study protocol for a randomized control trial to investigate the effectiveness of 
      an 8-week mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) 
      transdiagnostic group intervention for primary care patients.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s12888-019-2411-1 [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective transdiagnostic treatments for patients presenting with 
      principal or comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression enable more efficient 
      provision of mental health care and may be particularly suitable for the varied 
      population seen in primary healthcare settings. Mindfulness-integrated cognitive 
      behavior therapy (MiCBT) is a transdiagnostic intervention that integrates 
      aspects of CBT, including exposure skills targeting avoidance, with training in 
      mindfulness meditation skills adopted from the Vipassana or insight tradition 
      taught by the Burmese teachers U Ba Khin and Goenka. MiCBT is distinguished from 
      both cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy by the use of a 
      theoretical framework which proposes that the locus of reinforcement of behavior 
      is the interoceptive experience (body sensations) that co-arises with 
      self-referential thinking. Consequently, MiCBT has a strong focus on body 
      scanning to develop interoceptive awareness and equanimity. Designed for clinical 
      purposes, the four-stage systemic approach of MiCBT, comprising intra-personal 
      (Stage 1) exposure (Stage 2), interpersonal (Stage 3), and empathic (Stage 4) 
      skillsets, is a distinguishing feature among other mindfulness-based 
      interventions (MBIs). The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how 
      group MiCBT decreases depression and anxiety symptoms for patients with a range 
      of common mental health conditions. METHODS: Participants (n = 120) recruited via 
      medical practitioner referral will be randomized to MiCBT or a wait-list control. 
      Inclusion criteria are age 18-75; fluent in English and having a Kessler 
      Psychological Distress Scale (K10) score of 20 or more. The MiCBT treatment group 
      receive an 8-week MiCBT intervention delivered in a private psychology practice. 
      Participants complete a suite of online self-report measures and record the 
      amount of meditation practice undertaken each week. The control group receive 
      usual treatment and complete the measures at the same time points. Primary 
      outcome measures are the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and K10. 
      Analysis will use mixed-model repeated measures. DISCUSSION: The potential 
      ability of MiCBT to provide a comprehensive therapeutic system that is applicable 
      across diagnostic groups would make it an attractive addition to the available 
      MBIs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the Australia and New 
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12617000061336; Date of registration: 11th 
      January 2017.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Mobile Health to Address Unhealthy Eating Among Middle-Aged 
      Sexual Minority Women With Early Life Adversity: Mixed Methods Feasibility Trial.
PG  - e46310

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexual minority women (lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer, and 
      other nonheterosexual women) remain considerably underrepresented in health 
      research despite being at a higher risk for diabetes and obesity as well as 
      stigma and psychological distress than their heterosexual peers. In addition, 
      early life adversity (ELA) is prevalent among sexual minority women, which 
      further increases risks for obesity, psychological distress, and poor 
      cardiovascular health. App-based mindfulness interventions are potentially 
      promising for this group in mitigating the adverse health effects of ELA, 
      reducing food craving and unhealthy eating, addressing the risks associated with 
      obesity. OBJECTIVE: This mixed methods feasibility trial aimed to test a 
      mindfulness-based mobile health approach for middle-aged sexual minority women 
      (aged 30-55 years) with ELA and overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m(2)) to 
      improve health outcomes. METHODS: The single-arm trial was advertised on social 
      media and various lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer web-based 
      groups. At baseline, after the intervention (2 months), and at the 4-month 
      follow-up, participants completed assessments of primary outcomes (food craving, 
      emotional eating, and weight via a mailed scale) and secondary outcomes 
      (depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and emotion dysregulation). A standardized 
      weight measure was mailed to participants for weight reporting. Feasibility and 
      acceptability were assessed after the intervention via surveys and semistructured 
      exit interviews. RESULTS: We screened 442 individuals, among which 30 eligible 
      sexual minority women (mean age 40.20, SD 7.15 years) from various US regions 
      were enrolled in the study. At baseline, 86% (26/30) and 80% (24/30) of 
      participants had elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Among 
      the 30 enrolled participants, 20 (66%) completed all intervention modules, 25 
      (83%) were retained at the 2-month follow-up, and 20 (66%) were retained at the 
      4-month follow-up. None reported adverse effects. From baseline to the 4-month 
      follow-up, large effects were found in food craving (Cohen d=1.64) and 
      reward-based eating (Cohen d=1.56), whereas small effects were found with weight 
      (Cohen d=0.20; 4.21 kg on average). Significant improvements were also found in 
      the secondary outcomes (depression, Cohen d=0.98; anxiety, Cohen d=0.50; 
      mindfulness, Cohen d=0.49; and emotion dysregulation, Cohen d=0.44; all P<.05). 
      Participants with higher levels of parental verbal and emotional abuse were 
      particularly responsive to the intervention. Participants reported that the 
      program aligned with their goals and expectations, was easy to use, and 
      facilitated changes in eating behavior and mental health. Barriers to engagement 
      included the need for diverse teachers, individualized support, and body positive 
      language. CONCLUSIONS: This early phase feasibility trial provides 
      proof-of-concept support for a mindfulness mobile health approach to improve 
      obesity-related outcomes among sexual minority women and warrants a larger 
      randomized controlled trial in the future. The findings also suggest the need to 
      address trauma and psychological health when addressing weight-related outcomes 
      among sexual minority women.

TI  - A case series study of compassion-focused therapy for distressing experiences in 
      psychosis.
PG  - 762-781
LID - 10.1111/bjc.12437 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) is an evolution-informed 
      biopsychosocial approach that seeks to cultivate attachment and care motivational 
      systems and their psychophysiological regulators. These can counteract some of 
      the harmful effects of social threat, inferiority, shame, self-criticism and 
      depression, which are common in people with psychosis and undermine their 
      well-being, social trust and ability to feel safe. This study aimed to test the 
      acceptability of a novel manualized individual CFT intervention for psychosis 
      (CFTp). DESIGN: A non-concurrent, multiple-baseline, case series design, with 
      three phases: baseline, intervention and follow-up. METHODS: The 26-session CFTp 
      intervention was provided for a sample of eight people with distressing psychotic 
      experiences and a psychosis-related diagnosis. The study aimed to assess 
      acceptability of CFTp and to test clinically reliable improvements while 
      receiving the intervention, compared to a baseline period. RESULTS: Seven of 
      eight participants completed the therapy, and clinically reliable improvements 
      were found at both the single-case and group level of analysis. At the 
      single-case level, over half the participants showed improvements in depression 
      (5/7), stress (5/7), distress (5/7), anxiety (4/7) and voices (3/5). One 
      participant showed a deterioration in anxiety (1/7) and dissociation (1/7). At 
      the group level (n = 7), there were significant improvements in depression, 
      stress, distress, voices and delusions. The improvements in voices, delusions and 
      distress were sustained at 6- to 8-week follow-up, but depression and stress 
      dropped slightly to trend-level improvements. CONCLUSIONS: CFTp is a feasible and 
      acceptable intervention for psychosis, and further investigation is warranted 
      with a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - A research protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial designed to examine 
      the feasibility of a couple-based mind-body intervention for patients with 
      metastatic lung cancer and their partners.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s40814-018-0231-6 [doi]
LID - 37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the generally incurable nature of metastatic non-small cell 
      lung cancer (mNSCLC), patients and their romantic partners are at risk for 
      existential/spiritual distress. Although a handful of dyadic psychosocial 
      interventions for lung cancer patients and their caregivers exist, none of them 
      target spiritual well-being. Informed by the mindfulness-based intervention 
      literature and our pilot work in couples affected by lung cancer, we developed a 
      brief couple-based mind-body (CBMB) intervention. The primary aim of this 
      research protocol is to determine the feasibility of implementing the CBMB 
      intervention versus an active control (AC) or wait list control (WLC) group in 
      patients with mNSCLC and their partners using a randomized controlled trial 
      design. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with mNSCLC receiving treatment and their 
      partners are randomized to the CBMB intervention, an AC or a WLC group. Those in 
      the CBMB intervention and AC groups receive four intervention sessions of 60 min 
      each over 4 weeks and complete weekly homework assignments. The first session is 
      delivered in person, and the remaining sessions are delivered via 
      videoconference. The dyads in the AC group discuss cancer-related and personal 
      growth concerns with the interventionist but are not taught coping skills. 
      Patients and partners in all groups complete baseline assessments of quality of 
      life (QOL) prior to randomization. Follow-up assessments are performed 4 weeks 
      and then again 3 months later. The primary outcome is feasibility (i.e., ≥ 30% of 
      eligible couples consent, ≥ 70% of enrolled couples are retained, and ≥ 50% of 
      all CBMB and AC sessions are attended). We will also perform primarily 
      descriptive analyses of the self-reported outcomes (e.g., spiritual well-being 
      and psychological distress) and explore potential intervention mediators (i.e., 
      compassion, communication, mindfulness, and closeness) to inform a larger, future 
      trial. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide important information regarding the 
      feasibility of a behavioral intervention in a vulnerable yet understudied 
      population using videoconferencing and descriptive data regarding spiritual 
      well-being and other indices of QOL in both mNSCLC patients and their partners.

AB  - At least a third of women across reproductive ages experience low sexual desire 
      and impaired arousal. There is increasing evidence that mindfulness, defined as 
      non-judgmental present moment awareness, may improve women's sexual functioning. 
      The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based 
      therapy, either immediately or after a 3-month waiting period, in women seeking 
      treatment for low sexual desire and arousal. Women participated in four 90-min 
      group sessions that included mindfulness meditation, cognitive therapy, and 
      education. A total of 117 women were assigned to either the immediate treatment 
      (n = 68, mean age 40.8 yrs) or delayed treatment (n = 49, mean age 42.2 yrs) 
      group, in which women had two pre-treatment baseline assessments followed by 
      treatment. A total of 95 women completed assessments through to the 6-month 
      follow-up period. Compared to the delayed treatment control group, treatment 
      significantly improved sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, sexual 
      satisfaction, and overall sexual functioning. Sex-related distress significantly 
      decreased in both conditions, regardless of treatment, as did orgasmic 
      difficulties and depressive symptoms. Increases in mindfulness and a reduction in 
      depressive symptoms predicted improvements in sexual desire. Mindfulness-based 
      group therapy significantly improved sexual desire and other indices of sexual 
      response, and should be considered in the treatment of women's sexual 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement reduces opioid craving among 
      individuals with opioid use disorder and chronic pain in medication assisted 
      treatment: Ecological momentary assessments from a stage 1 randomized controlled 
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is an efficacious form of 
      medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), yet many individuals 
      on MMT relapse. Chronic pain and deficits in positive affective response to 
      natural rewards may result in dysphoria that fuels opioid craving and promotes 
      relapse. As such, behavioral therapies that ameliorate chronic pain and enhance 
      positive affect may serve as useful adjuncts to MMT. This analysis of ecological 
      momentary assessment (EMA) data from a Stage 1 randomized clinical trial examined 
      effects of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) on opioid craving, 
      pain, and positive affective state. METHODS: Participants with OUD and chronic 
      pain (N = 30) were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or treatment as usual (TAU). 
      Across 8 weeks of treatment, participants completed up to 112 random EMA measures 
      of craving, pain, and affect, as well as event-contingent craving ratings. 
      Multilevel models examined the effects of MORE on craving, pain, and affect, as 
      well as the association between positive affect and craving. RESULTS: EMA showed 
      significantly greater improvements in craving, pain unpleasantness, stress, and 
      positive affect for participants in MORE than for participants in TAU. 
      Participants in MORE reported having nearly 1.3 times greater self-control over 
      craving than those in TAU. Further, positive affect was associated with reduced 
      craving, an association that was significantly stronger among participants in 
      MORE than TAU. CONCLUSION: MORE may be a useful non-pharmacological adjunct among 
      individuals with OUD and chronic pain in MMT.

TI  - The effect of a web-based psychoeducation on emotional functioning, eating 
      behaviors, and body image among premenopausal women with excess body weight.
PG  - 423-435
LID - 10.1007/s00737-020-01077-1 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were twofold: (1) to investigate the effectiveness of 
      web-based psychoeducation for emotional functioning, eating behaviors, and body 
      image among premenopausal women with excess body weight, and (2) to compare the 
      efficacy of two types of web-based psychoeducation. Three hundred individuals 
      were asked to volunteer in the present study. All participants were recruited in 
      Poland from September 2017 to July 2019. Finally, a total of 129 premenopausal 
      women took part in the research and signed informed consent. Their ages ranged 
      between 18 and 48 years old (M = 32.28, SD = 7.65). Self-reported weight and 
      height were recorded. BMI was calculated using self-reported data. Their average 
      body mass index was 30.54 kg/m(2) (SD = 3.69). In our randomized experiment, the 
      participants were allocated into three groups: experimental group I (EG I, 
      N = 43), experimental group II (EG II, N = 46), and wait list control group (CG, 
      N = 40). Five questionnaires were included in the online survey at the baseline 
      measurement (Day 0), at the end of psychoeducational intervention (Day 16) and 
      75 days from the start of the 15-day intervention (Day 76). Measurement tools 
      included the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Positive and Negative 
      Affect Schedule, the Mindful Eating Scale, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, 
      and the Body Attitude Test. Our eHealth web-based psychoeducation consisted of 
      three modules: emotional functioning module (EG I: theoretically consistent 
      approach (TCA) vs EG II: eclectic approach; EA), eating behaviors module (EG I, 
      EG II: based on mindfulness-based eating training; MET), body image module (EG I, 
      EG II: based on Cash's prevention of body image disturbances; CPBID). The first 
      experimental group (EG I) had intervention containing TCA, MET, and CPBID, while 
      the second experimental group (EG II) EA, MET, and CPBID. According to 
      between-group comparison, both types of web-based psychoeducation led to an 
      increase in adaptive emotion regulation (Day 16: EG I vs CG: p < 0.001, EG II vs 
      CG: p < 0.001; Day 76: EG I vs CG: p < 0.01, EG II vs CG: p < 0.001). In EG I, 
      the intervention resulted in a higher reduction (than in CG) in emotional eating 
      (Day 16: p < 0.01, Day 76: p < 0.01), uncontrolled eating (Day 16: p < 0.05, Day 
      76: p < 0.05), and negative appreciation of body size (Day 16: p < 0.01, Day 76: 
      p < 0.01). In EG II, a lower level of emotional eating was found on Day 76 (EG II 
      vs CG: p < 0.05). Two months after completion of the 15-day intervention, no 
      statistically significant reduction for BMI was observed in either experimental 
      group (p > 0.05). The effectiveness of both types of web-based psychoeducation 
      was also confirmed in within-group comparison (Day 0 vs Day 16 and Day 0 vs Day 
      76). There was a significant increase in emotion regulation and mindful eating, 
      as well as a decrease in emotional eating, uncontrolled eating, negative 
      appreciation of body size, lack of familiarity with one's body, and the 
      experiencing of negative emotions in both experimental groups (EG I, EG II). Both 
      types of web-based psychoeducation might have to be considered in creating future 
      web-based psychoeducation among premenopausal women with excess body weight.

TI  - Effects of a mindfulness-based intervention and a health self-management 
      programme on psychological well-being in older adults with subjective cognitive 
      decline: Secondary analyses from the SCD-Well randomised clinical trial.
PG  - e0295175
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0295175 [doi]
LID - e0295175
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) recruited from 
      memory clinics have an increased risk of developing dementia and regularly 
      experience reduced psychological well-being related to memory concerns and fear 
      of dementia. Research on improving well-being in SCD is limited and lacks 
      non-pharmacological approaches. We investigated whether mindfulness-based and 
      health education interventions can enhance well-being in SCD. METHODS: The 
      SCD-Well trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03005652) randomised 147 older adults with 
      SCD to an 8-week caring mindfulness-based approach for seniors (CMBAS) or an 
      active comparator (health self-management programme [HSMP]). Well-being was 
      assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month post-randomisation using the 
      Psychological Well-being Scale (PWBS), the World Health Organisation's Quality of 
      Life (QoL) Assessment psychological subscale, and composites capturing 
      meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, and insight. 
      Mixed effects models were used to assess between- and within-group differences in 
      change. RESULTS: CMBAS was superior to HSMP on changes in connection at 
      post-intervention. Within both groups, PWBS total scores, psychological QoL, and 
      composite scores did not increase. Exploratory analyses indicated increases in 
      PWBS autonomy at post-intervention in both groups. CONCLUSION: Two 
      non-pharmacological interventions were associated with only limited effects on 
      psychological well-being in SCD. Longer intervention studies with waitlist/retest 
      control groups are needed to assess if our findings reflect intervention brevity 
      and/or minimal base rate changes in well-being.

TI  - Effect of Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction during 
      pregnancy on placental volume and perfusion: A subanalysis of the IMPACT BCN 
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 2042-2052
LID - 10.1111/aogs.14874 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The IMPACT BCN trial-a parallel-group randomized clinical trial 
      where 1221 pregnant women at high risk for small-for-gestational age (SGA) 
      newborns were randomly allocated at 19- to 23-week gestation into three groups: 
      Mediterranean diet, Mindfulness-based Stress reduction or non-intervention-has 
      demonstrated a positive effect of Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction in the 
      prevention of SGA. However, the mechanism of action of these interventions 
      remains still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 
      Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction on placental volume and perfusion. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received 
      monthly individual and group educational sessions, and free provision of 
      extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Women in the Stress reduction group underwent 
      an 8-week Stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 
      2.5-h and one full-day sessions. Non-intervention group was based on usual care. 
      Placental volume and perfusion were assessed in a subgroup of randomly selected 
      women (n = 165) using magnetic resonance (MR) at 36-week gestation. Small 
      placental volume was defined as MR estimated volume <10th centile. Perfusion was 
      assessed by intravoxel incoherent motion. RESULTS: While mean MR placental volume 
      was similar among the study groups, both interventions were associated with a 
      lower prevalence of small placental volume (3.9% Mediterranean diet and 5% stress 
      reduction vs. 17% non-intervention; p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). 
      Logistic regression showed that small placental volume was significantly 
      associated with higher risk of SGA in both study groups (OR 7.48 [1.99-28.09] in 
      Mediterranean diet and 20.44 [5.13-81.4] in Stress reduction). Mediation analysis 
      showed that the effect of Mediterranean diet on SGA can be decomposed by a direct 
      effect and an indirect effect (56.6%) mediated by a small placental volume. 
      Similarly, the effect of Stress reduction on SGA is partially mediated (45.3%) by 
      a small placental volume. Results on placental intravoxel incoherent motion 
      perfusion fraction and diffusion coefficient were similar among the study groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Structured interventions during pregnancy based on Mediterranean 
      diet or Stress reduction are associated with a lower proportion of small 
      placentas, which is consistent with the previously observed beneficial effects of 
      these interventions on fetal growth.

TI  - A Mobile App to Support Self-Management in Patients with Multiple Myeloma or 
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e44533
LID - 10.2196/44533 [doi]
LID - e44533
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with blood cancer experience serious physical and emotional 
      symptoms throughout their cancer journey. OBJECTIVE: Building on previous work, 
      we aimed to develop an app designed to help patients with multiple myeloma and 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia self-manage symptoms and test it for acceptability 
      and preliminary efficacy. METHODS: We developed our Blood Cancer Coach app with 
      input from clinicians and patients. Our 2-armed randomized controlled pilot trial 
      recruited participants from Duke Health and nationally in partnerships with the 
      Association of Oncology Social Work, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, and other 
      patient groups. Participants were randomized to the attention control 
      (Springboard Beyond Cancer website) arm or the Blood Cancer Coach app 
      intervention arm. The fully automated Blood Cancer Coach app included symptom and 
      distress tracking with tailored feedback, medication reminders and adherence 
      tracking, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia education resources, 
      and mindfulness activities. Patient-reported data were collected at baseline, 4 
      weeks, and 8 weeks for both arms through the Blood Cancer Coach app. Outcomes of 
      interest were global health (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System Global Health), posttraumatic stress (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
      Checklist for DSM-5), and cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System 
      Revised). Among participants in the intervention arm, satisfaction surveys and 
      usage data were used to evaluate acceptability. RESULTS: Among 180 patients who 
      downloaded the app, 49% (89) of them consented to participate and 40% (72) of 
      them completed baseline surveys. Of those who completed baseline surveys, 53% 
      (38) of them completed week 4 surveys (16 intervention and 22 control) and 39% 
      (28) of them completed week 8 surveys (13 intervention and 15 control). Most 
      participants found the app at least moderately effective at helping manage 
      symptoms (87%), feeling more comfortable seeking help (87%), increasing awareness 
      of resources (73%), and reported being satisfied with the app overall (73%). 
      Participants completed an average of 248.5 app tasks over the 8-week study 
      period. The most used functions within the app were medication log, distress 
      tracking, guided meditations, and symptom tracking. There were no significant 
      differences between the control and intervention arms at week 4 or 8 on any 
      outcomes. We also saw no significant improvement over time within the 
      intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our feasibility pilot were 
      promising in which most participants found the app to be helpful in managing 
      their symptoms, reported satisfaction with the app, and that it was helpful in 
      several important areas. We did not, however, find significantly reduced symptoms 
      or improved global mental and physical health over 2 months. Recruitment and 
      retention were challenging for this app-based study, an experience echoed by 
      others. Limitations included a predominantly White and college educated sample. 
      Future studies would do well to include self-efficacy outcomes, target those with 
      more symptoms, and emphasize diversity in recruitment and retention. TRIAL

TI  - Association of Short-term Change in Leukocyte Telomere Length With Cortical 
      Thickness and Outcomes of Mental Training Among Healthy Adults: A Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - e199687
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.9687 [doi]
LID - e199687
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Telomere length is associated with the development of age-related 
      diseases and structural differences in multiple brain regions. It remains 
      unclear, however, whether change in telomere length is linked to brain structure 
      change, and to what extent telomere length can be influenced through mental 
      training. OBJECTIVES: To assess the dynamic associations between leukocyte 
      telomere length (LTL) and cortical thickness (CT), and to determine whether LTL 
      is affected by a longitudinal contemplative mental training intervention. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open-label efficacy trial of three 3-month mental 
      training modules with healthy, meditation-naive adults was conducted. Data on LTL 
      and CT were collected 4 times over 9 months between April 22, 2013, and March 31, 
      2015, as part of the ReSource Project. Data analysis was performed between 
      September 23, 2016, and June 21, 2019. Of 1582 eligible individuals, 943 declined 
      to participate; 362 were randomly selected for participation and assigned to 
      training or retest control cohorts, with demographic characteristics matched. The 
      retest control cohorts underwent all testing but no training. Intention-to-treat 
      analysis was performed. INTERVENTIONS: Training cohort participants completed 3 
      modules cultivating interoception and attention (Presence), compassion (Affect), 
      or perspective taking (Perspective). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in LTL 
      and CT. RESULTS: Of the 362 individuals randomized, 30 participants dropped out 
      before study initiation (initial sample, 332). Data were available for analysis 
      of the training intervention in 298 participants (n = 222 training; n = 76 retest 
      control) (175 women [58.7%]; mean [SD] age, 40.5 [9.3] years). The training 
      modules had no effect on LTL. In 699 observations from all 298 participants, mean 
      estimated changes in the relative ratios of telomere repeat copy number to 
      single-copy gene (T/S) were for no training, 0.004 (95% CI, -0.010 to 0.018); 
      Presence, -0.007 (95% CI, -0.025 to 0.011); Affect, -0.005 (95% CI, -0.019 to 
      0.010); and Perspective, -0.001 (95% CI, -0.017 to 0.016). Cortical thickness 
      change data were analyzed in 167 observations from 67 retest control participants 
      (37 women [55.2%], mean [SD] age, 39.6 [9.0] years). In this retest control 
      cohort subsample, naturally occurring LTL change was related to CT change in the 
      left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex (mean t161 = 3.22; 
      P < .001; r = 0.246). At the individual participant level, leukocyte telomere 
      shortening as well as lengthening were observed. Leukocyte telomere shortening 
      was related to cortical thinning (t77 = 2.38; P = .01; r = 0.262), and leukocyte 
      telomere lengthening was related to cortical thickening (t77 = 2.42; P = .009; 
      r = 0.266). All analyses controlled for age, sex, and body mass index. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this trial indicate an association 
      between short-term change in LTL and concomitant change in plasticity of the left 
      precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex. This result contributes to 
      the evidence that LTL changes more dynamically on the individual level than 
      previously thought. Further studies are needed to determine potential long-term 
      implications of such change in relation to cellular aging and the development of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. No effect of contemplative mental training was noted 
      in what may be, to date, the longest intervention with healthy adults. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01833104.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Program for Anxiety and Depression Treatment in Healthcare 
      Professionals: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10245941 [doi]
LID - 5941
AB  - In primary health care, the work environment can cause high levels of anxiety and 
      depression, triggering relevant expert and individual change. Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs reduce signs of anxiety and depression. The 
      purpose of this sub-analysis of the total project, was to equate the 
      effectiveness of the standard MBSR curriculum with the abbreviated version in 
      minimizing anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled clinical trial 
      enrolled 112 mentors and resident specialists from Family and Community Medicine 
      and Nurses (FCMN), distributed across six teaching units (TU) of the Spanish 
      National Health System (SNHS). Experimental group participants received a MBRS 
      training (abbreviated/standard). Depression and anxiety levels were measured with 
      the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS) at three different time periods 
      during the analysis: before (pre-test) and after (post-test) participation, as 
      well as 3 months after the completion of intervention. Taking into account the 
      pre-test scores as the covariate, an adjusted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
      showed significant depletion in anxiety and depression in general (F (2.91) = 
      4.488; p = 0.014; η(2) = 0.090) and depression in particular (F (2, 91) = 6.653; 
      p = 0.002; η(2) = 0.128 at the post-test visit, maintaining their effects for 3 
      months (F (2.79) = 3.031; p = 0.050; η(2) = 0.071-F (2.79) = 2.874; p = 0.049; 
      η(2) = 0.068, respectively), which is associated with the use of a standard 
      training program. The abbreviated training program did not have a significant 
      effect on the level of anxiety and depression. The standard MBSR training program 
      had a positive effect on anxiety and depression and promotes long-lasting effects 
      in tutors and resident practitioners. New research is needed to demonstrate the 
      effectiveness of abbreviated versions of training programs.
