AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) has been shown to be effective in reducing stress and burnout in parents and professional caregivers of children and adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effects of the mindfulness (MB) and positive behavior support (PBS) components against the MBPBS program for mindful parenting. Methods: The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e., aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers’ requests). Results: Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the children’s aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition, respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to mothers’ requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then PBS. Changes across all variables for both mothers and their children were maintained for 3 years post-intervention. After time and training type were controlled for, meditation time was a significant predictor in reducing aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and in enhancing compliance of the children with mothers’ requests. Conclusions: Positive outcomes for mothers and their children with ASD were significantly greater in the MBPBS condition, followed by the MB condition, and least in the PBS condition. MBPBS appears to be an effective mindful parenting program on the assessed variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Based on its role in social processing and stress, oxytocin was suggested to mediate stress reduction after compassion-based mental training. In the ReSource Project, a 9-month longitudinal mental training study, we first examined oxytocin's role in psychosocial stress reduction after training socio-affective (i.e., compassion-based, Affect Module), socio-cognitive or attentional skills (Perspective and Presence Modules, n=313). In a second study, using a subsample (n=113), we explored the effect of one compassion (Loving-kindness) meditation (LKM) on oxytocin, cortisol and subjective responses after 3-month Affect training (vs. rest with no training). Independent of training, stress triggered acute oxytocin release (p<0.001). LKM did not elicit acute oxytocin responses. Training effects were found in overall oxytocin levels in both studies. Compared to no training, Affect training decreased overall oxytocin during stress (p<0.05, d=0.50) but increased it during LKM (p<0.001, d=-0.72). Overall oxytocin changes were unrelated to cortisol and subjective stress reactivity. Based on Quintana and Guastella's (2020) theory of oxytocin as an allostatic hormone with anticipatory features, we interpret training-induced oxytocin changes as shifts in the anticipated emotional relevance of events. After 3-month Affect training, stress may have lost its emotional saliency, while LKM gained in emotional relevance. Finally, oxytocin does not mediate stress reduction after mental training.

AB  - Emotional dysregulation poses significant challenges for women who have experienced trauma and can contribute to problems with substance use in an attempt to manage intense emotions and arousal. Various forms of meditation have shown benefits for improved awareness and management of emotions and offer a promising complementary treatment for women in residential substance use treatment who have histories of interpersonal traumas. This qualitative study explored lived experiences with meditation practice and emotional regulation among female trauma survivors with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders. Thirty-two trauma survivors participated in a six-week curriculum at their residential treatment program that included mindfulness, compassion, and loving-kindness meditations. Using an emergent design based on the constant comparative method, the study analyzed qualitative data from individual interviews and focus groups and identified common themes. The findings indicated a perceived pathway through which meditation promoted emotional regulation. This pathway started with increased awareness of their emotions, involved the ability to then accept and let go of their emotions, and ended with emotional growth and improved self-regulation. Though participants portrayed meditation as beneficial, several participants also described suppressed emotions and traumatic memories resurfacing during meditation and described the importance of support from program staff outside of group to help them process and cope. The participants’ perspectives support the appropriateness of meditation as an empowering complementary intervention for female trauma survivors with co-occurring disorders, but also indicate the importance of supervision and support at the start of meditation practice in case negative experiences arise.

AB  - The recognition of mindfulness-based interventions as an effective approach to address psychological distress and improve well-being has stimulated the development of a multitude of programs, each designed for specific applications. While many mindfulness-based interventions are focused on addressing particular psychological needs, so-called second-generation mindfulness-based interventions typically include overtly spiritual content but also remain secular in their delivery. More recently, explicitly religion-themed mindfulness programs have emerged that are yet to be evaluated scientifically, raising questions as to how this to occur in the most appropriate manner. Referring to doctrinal charts in Won Buddhism, we illustrate an example of how the distinction can be made transparent between content that can be subjected to scientific inquiry and content related to religious and personal beliefs. By delineating elements of belief from practice, areas can be identified that are open for scientific verification without causing offense. Program participants and other practitioners can then clearly identify the specific aspects for which there is widely accepted evidence for their effectiveness, which may then also be communicated as science-based Buddhist practices.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 13(5) of Mindfulness (see record [rid]2022-72851-002[/rid]). In the advanced online publication, there was an error in the sixth author's name. 'Salzburg' should be 'Salzberg'. The name appears correctly in this record.] Objectives People raised in low-socioeconomic status (SES) households are at an increased risk for physical illness in adulthood. A shift in gene expression profiles in the immune system is one biological mechanism thought to account for elevated disease susceptibility, with a frequently investigated profile being the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral and antibody-related genes. Methods The present study investigated, in a sample of at-risk midlife adults (N = 88), whether those randomized to learn loving-kindness meditation (LKM) in a 6-week workshop would show a reduction in CTRA gene expression, compared to those randomized to learn mindfulness meditation (MM). We assessed emotions daily and hypothesized positive emotions to account for the expected effect of LKM on gene expression. Results Results showed significant group differences from pre- to post-intervention, yet in the opposite direction as hypothesized: Participants randomized to the MM group showed significant declines in CTRA gene expression, whereas those in the LKM group showed significant increases in CTRA gene expression. Both groups showed increases over the 6 weeks in daily reports of positive emotions (b = .007, p < .001) alongside decreases in negative emotions (b = − .005, p < .001). Thus, positive emotions were not pursued as a candidate mediator of observed group effects. Conclusions This study is the first to examine whether the biological impact of childhood low SES can be reversed in midlife through meditation interventions. Results suggest mindfulness meditation may be a viable option for improving health outcomes in this at-risk population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Despite being often overlapped and used interchangeably in academic literature, loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion meditation (CM) are also seen to have their distinct features. As a differential approach towards LKM and CM can promote a more accurate integration of these practices into the clinical field, it is worth studying their differential effects. The present preregistered study, thus, aimed to experimentally compare effects of single-session LKM and CM on first-time practitioners’ emotions. Methods: Two hundred and one university students were randomly allocated to three (LKM, CM, and control) groups. The self-reported emotions were measured twice, before and after completing an assigned task. Results: Both LKM and CM significantly increased other-focused positive emotions, compared with the control condition. Both LKM and CM increased happiness and overall positive emotions and decreased sadness; however, the effect sizes of LKM were consistently larger compared to those of CM. Both LKM and CM significantly increased low arousal positive emotions, compared with the control condition. Conclusions: LKM and CM represent two theoretically different practices. However, as they belong to the same tradition of meditation, they are similar in their intention of forming positive wishes towards self and others, and this appeared to have a positive effect on practitioners’ emotional experience. At the same time, LKM was found to be more effective in evoking positive emotions in first-time practitioners, compared with CM. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Low Agreeableness is a personality dimension involving hostility, antagonistic behaviors, and the propensity for conflict. Within the repertoire of positive psychology interventions, the practice of compassion may be a particularly redemptive for these individuals given their deficits in this domain. Helping has previously been found to boosts momentary positive affect in nonaltruists (Conway, Rogelberg, & Pitts, 2009). Consequently, we hypothesized that individuals low on trait Agreeableness would report greater benefits from compassion interventions, including reductions in depression and increases in life satisfaction. Two compassion exercises were investigated: (a) a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) exercise, and (b) an acts of kindness exercise. These were compared with a control condition involving the journaling of interpersonal relationships. Participants were drawn from an international sample (N = 648) and were randomly assigned to one of the 3 conditions. All groups completed their exercise online every other day for 3 weeks. Trait Agreeableness was assessed at baseline with the Big Five Inventory (John & Srivastava, 1999). Measures of depression and life satisfaction were administered at baseline, at posttest, and 1 and 2 months later at follow-up assessments. Findings showed that participants in both experimental conditions (LKM and Acts of Kindness) reported significant reductions in depression at posttest compared with those in the control condition. Personality also interacted with exercise condition such that those low on Agreeableness doing acts of kindness reported the greatest reductions in depression, and increases in life satisfaction at 2 months, compared with those in the LKM and control conditions.

AB  - What is the significance of this article for the general public?—The results from this research show that brief compassion training delivered online can lead to significant reductions in depression after a 3-week practice. Interestingly, individuals low on Agreeableness have the most to gain from behaving kindly. This has immediate practical applications for social scientists, policymakers, psychology researchers, and health practitioners. The widespread application of compassion interventions could contribute to a more humane and kinder society, particularly when targeted at those prone to hostility.

AB  - Objectives: Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has been shown to improve wellbeing and positive emotions in clinical and non-clinical populations. The main goal of the present study was to examine whether LKM might be an effective intervention to promote positive mental health using the Positive Mental Health Scale (PMH) and to decrease depression, anxiety, and stress in university students. Methods: The sample (n = 110) consisted of university students in Germany. One half of them (n = 55) underwent LKM intervention. They were compared with a matched control group (n = 55) which did not receive treatment. All participants completed positive and negative mental health measures at baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments. LKM participants additionally completed the same measures before and after treatment. Multiple analyses of variance were conducted to test for short- and long-term effects of LKM on positive and negative mental health measures. Results: A significant short-term effect of LKM on anxiety and PMH was found. Long-term analyses revealed a significant decrease of depression, anxiety, and stress for LKM completers, and a significant increase of depression, anxiety, and stress for the control group. Conclusions: The results suggest that LKM enhances mental health in university students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are often stressed due to the demands of the job, including the nature and severity of challenging behaviors of the clients, work conditions, degree of management support for the staff, and the demands of implementing some interventions under adverse conditions. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and PBS alone have been shown to be effective in assisting caregivers to better manage the challenging behaviors of clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The aim of the present study was to undertake a head-to-head assessment of the effectiveness of MBPBS and PBS alone in a 40-week randomized controlled trial. Of the 123 caregivers who met inclusion criteria, 60 were randomly assigned to MBPBS and 63 to PBS alone, with 59 completing the trial in the MBPBS condition and 57 in the PBS alone condition. Results showed both interventions to be effective, but the caregiver, client, and agency outcomes for MBPBS were uniformly superior to those of PBS alone condition. In addition, the MBPBS training was substantially more cost-effective than the PBS alone training. The present results add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of MBPBS and, if independently replicated, could provide an integrative health care approach in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities.

AB  - Several authors argue that interpersonal changes such as benevolence, compassion, and empathy should naturally emerge from adiligent practice of mindfulness. While empirical data from secularized and standardized mindfulness interventions do not fully support this assumption, a group of authors suggest that making underlying Buddhist teachings explicit within mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) might be a key factor in the modification of such culturally rooted aspects of interpersonal functioning. In order to investigate this suggestion, we compared a mindfulness program that explicitly integrates elements of Buddhist ethics(i.e., the four immeasurables) and wisdom (i.e., interdependency, non-self, common humanity) (ethics-oriented mindfulness training (EMT)), to a standard mindfulness training (SMT) program and a control group (i.e., waiting list), with a randomized controlled design in a community sample. Empathy components (i.e., affective responding, mentalization, emotion regulation,and behavioral responding), as well as variables that are typically associated with MBIs (i.e., mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being) were assessed using multi-dimensional measures (i.e., self-reported, behavioral, physiological). Results showed no overall effects on empathy of our interventions in comparison with our control group. With regard to other variables, we found specific effects for each of our interventions. Whereas SMT led to a stable increase in mindfulness (Cohen’s d = .7), EMT led instead to increases in self-compassion (Cohen’s d = .8) and subjective well-being (Cohen’s d = .54). Although challenging theoretical expectations, we posit that our lack of empathy effects might be explained by several factors such as program structure, individual differences, and culture.

AB  - Armed Forces personnel are exposed to traumatic experiences during their work; therefore, they are at risk of developing emotional difficulties such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following traumatic experiences. Despite evidence to suggest that self-compassion is effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD, and greater levels of self-compassion are associated with enhanced resilience, self-compassion in armed forces personnel and armed forces veterans remains under-researched. As a result, it is not known if therapeutic approaches that use self-compassion interventions are an acceptable and effective treatment for this population. Having previously shown that a one-off self-compassion exercise has temporary beneficial psychophysiological effects in non-clinical participants, we conducted this proof-of concept study to investigate whether this exercise is equally beneficial in veterans who had experienced deployment to a combat zone. Additionally, we examined if brief a self-compassion exercise can temporarily reduce hyperarousal symptoms and increase feelings of social connectedness. The current study also investigated the association between PTSD symptom severity, emotion regulation, and self-compassion in 56 veterans. All participants listened to a loving-kindness meditation for self-compassion (LKM-S) and psychophysiological recordings were taken throughout. Psychophysiological effects were observed including heart-rate (HR), skin conductance (SCL), and heart-rate variability (HRV) to determine associations with PTSD and changes in response associated with the self-compassion induction. PTSD symptom severity, dispositional emotion regulation, and self-compassion were measured, and participants also completed state measures of hyperarousal and social connectedness before and after the LKM-S. The findings partially demonstrated that self-compassion can be elicited in a veteran population but there were considerable individual differences in psychophysiological responses. The findings are discussed in light of existing theories of PTSD and self-compassion and the implications of using self-compassion based psychological approaches with veterans.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to co-design an interprofessional simulation grounded in caring science that emerged from the living experience of families whose children suffered from Tay-Sachs. Families met with faculty to share stories and to review and update drafts of the simulation. When the final draft was completed, the faculty demonstrated the simulation for families before introducing it to students. Students focused on empirical knowing to get through the simulation, the orders, medication administration, and could not find compassion because within their personal knowing they could not find courage.

AB  - The present study employed a quasi-experimental design, in which the experimental group (n = 13) practiced a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) via a single in-person workshop and via an app, whereas the active control group (n = 20) practiced progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Both interventions lasted 1 week and were executed in the respective soccer academy. The groups completed a pre- and posttest measuring compassion, fairness, and team cohesion. In contrast to our hypothesis, we did not find an interaction effect. LKM athletes did not demonstrate greater cohesion, fairness, and compassion after the intervention than the PMR athletes. By comparing user engagement and user rating between LKM and PMR, we conclude that LKM is as accepted as PMR by the study cohort. We suggest implementing future LKM interventions with substantial interaction parts and considering specific person-by-context interactions.

AB  - Objectives: Current treatments for chronic depression have focused on reducing interpersonal problems and negative affect, but paid little attention to promoting prosocial motivation and positive affect. Following this treatment focus, the objective of the present study was to examine whether the combination of metta (Loving Kindness) group meditation and subsequent tailored individual therapy focusing on kindness towards oneself and others (metta-based therapy, MBT) shows greater improvements in depressive symptoms than a wait list control group in patients with chronic depression. Methods: Forty-eight patients with DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder were randomly assigned to MBT or a wait list control condition. Outcome was assessed after group meditation, after subsequent individual therapy, and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was an independent blind rating of depressive symptoms at post-test. Secondary outcome included changes in self-reported depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, compassion, and clinician-rated emotion regulation. Results: Mixed-design analyses showed significant differences between MBT and WLC in changes from pre- to post-test in clinician-rated and self-rated depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, and emotion regulation. Most of the changes occurred during group meditation and were associated with large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: The results provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of MBT in treating chronic depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 13(8) of Mindfulness (see record [rid]2022-86776-001[/rid]). In the original article, there was an error in Table 1. A few labels were misplaced. The corrected table is included in the erratum. The original article has been corrected.] Objectives: Engaging in meditation seems to be an effective manner of bettering psychosocial health. Although these findings hold for most people, individual differences may affect who gets greater gains from meditation. Psychological (i.e., resilience, spirituality) and biological (i.e., cardiac vagal tone, oxytocin) personal resources may work individually or synergistically to catalyze meditation-related improvements in mental health, such as increased positive (well-being) and decreased negative (depression) mental health symptoms. Methods: A community-based sample of 210 adults (modeage = 35 years; 61.86% female) were recruited and randomly assigned to either mindfulness (n = 107; 51.2%) or loving-kindness (n = 102; 48.8%) meditation conditions (1 missing). The study lasted 18 months, starting with baseline measures, succeeded by a 6-week meditation intervention, and follow-up assessments every 3 months. Results: The fixed effect of resilience was significant, as was the interaction between resilience and time, indicating different mental health symptom trajectories during and after a meditation intervention based on resilience. Conclusions: Participants low in resilience tended to have the greatest gains (increased subjective well-being and decreased depressive symptoms) following a meditation intervention, yet these gains were not maintained 18 months following the intervention. Those high in resilience did not show mental health gains following a meditation intervention but did have higher subjective well-being symptoms 18 months following the intervention indicating that they may have experienced delayed gains.

AB  - Objective: Meditation interventions promote an array of well-being outcomes. However, the way in which these interventions promote beneficial outcomes is less clear. Here, we expanded on prior work by examining the influence of mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation on a key health behavior: physical activity. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we drew upon two randomized intervention studies. In the first study, 171 adults (73.0% female) received 6 weeks of training in either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation, or were assigned to a control condition. In the second study, 124 adults (60.0% female) were assigned to a 6-week mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation group. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that individuals who received mindfulness training reported sustained levels of physical activity across the intervention period (Pre: mean [standard deviation], or M [SD] = 4.09 [2.07]; Post: M [SD] = 3.68 [2.00]; p = .054), whereas those in the control (Pre: M [SD] = 3.98 [2.25]; Post: M [SD] = 3.01 [2.07]; p < .001) and loving-kindness (Pre: M [SD] = 4.11 [2.26]; Post: M [SD] = 3.45 [1.96]; p < .001) conditions reported lower levels. Study 2 demonstrated those who received mindfulness training experienced increases in positive emotions during physical activity from preintervention to postintervention (Pre: M [SD] = 6.06 [2.51]; Post: M [SD] = 6.54 [2.43]; p = .001), whereas those trained in loving-kindness meditation experienced decreases in positive emotions during physical activity (Pre: M [SD] = 6.45 [2.35]; Post: M [SD] = 6.09 [2.46]; p = .040). Conclusions: These results suggest mindfulness training (but not loving-kindness training) promotes sustained physical activity, and one plausible reason why this occurs is enhanced positive emotion during physical activity.

AB  - Objectives: In order to address an important gap in understanding mechanisms of depressive relapse, we complemented self-report with psychophysiological measures to a specifically developed brief self-compassion exercise, to examine if mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) reduces dispositional negative self-bias in individuals with recurrent depression. Methods: Individuals’ responses (self-report, heart rate, heart rate variability and skin conductance) during a previously validated brief self-compassion exercise were assessed in a repeated-measures experimental design at two timepoints 2.5–3 months apart in a convenience sample of remitted depressed attendees of an outpatient clinic for mood disorders. The first group received eight sessions of MBCT (n = 25) in between the two measurements whereas the second group was an untreated control group (n = 25). Results: When the MBCT group engaged in the self-compassion exercise after MBCT, they showed reduced physiological arousal and increased heart rate variability whereas no changes were observed in the untreated control group. Whereas self-reported state self-compassion after the exercise increased in both groups at both timepoints, only in the MBCT group were the overall levels of state and dispositional self-compassion increased significantly. Conclusion: MBCT appears to effectively reduce negative self-bias and facilitates psychophysiological benefits associated with a more positive self-view. Physiological responses to our self-compassion exercise could be useful markers of treatment-related changes and further mechanism research on depressive relapse prevention.

AB  - Cognitive abilities such as attention, memory, processing time, perception, and reasoning can be augmented using some type of intervention. Within the broad range of conventional and unconventional intervention methods used in cognitive enhancement, meditation is one of those that is safe, widely practiced by many since ancient times, and has been shown to reduce stress and improve psychological health and cognitive functioning. Various neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown functional and structural changes due to meditation in different types of meditation practices and on various groups of meditators. Recently, a few studies on meditation have used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study the effects of meditation on cerebral hemodynamics. In this study, we examined the short-term effects of loving-kindness (LK) meditation on sustained attention using behavioral performance measures, physiological outcomes, and cognitive activity as measured by fNIRS in first-time meditators during Stroop color word task (SCWT) performance. Our results indicated that behavioral outcomes, assessed mainly on response time (RT) during SCWT performance, showed a significant decrease after meditation. As expected, physiological measures, primarily pulse pressure (PP) measured after meditation dropped significantly as compared to the before meditation measurement. For the hemodynamic measures of oxygenated-hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxygenated-hemoglobin (Hb), and total-hemoglobin (HbT), our findings show significant differences in SCWT performance before and after meditation. Our results suggest that LK meditation can result in improvements in cognitive, physiological, and behavioral outcomes of first-time meditators after a short-term session. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reports an error in 'For whom do meditation interventions improve mental health symptoms? Looking at the roles of psychological and biological resources over time' by Nikki E. Barczak-Scarboro, Patty Van Cappellen and Barbara L. Fredrickson (Mindfulness, 2021[Nov], Vol 12[11], 2781-2793). In the original article, there was an error in Table 1. A few labels were misplaced. The corrected table is included in the erratum. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-87985-001[/rid]). Objectives: Engaging in meditation seems to be an effective manner of bettering psychosocial health. Although these findings hold for most people, individual differences may affect who gets greater gains from meditation. Psychological (i.e., resilience, spirituality) and biological (i.e., cardiac vagal tone, oxytocin) personal resources may work individually or synergistically to catalyze meditation-related improvements in mental health, such as increased positive (well-being) and decreased negative (depression) mental health symptoms. Methods: A community-based sample of 210 adults (modeage = 35 years; 61.86% female) were recruited and randomly assigned to either mindfulness (n = 107; 51.2%) or loving-kindness (n = 102; 48.8%) meditation conditions (1 missing). The study lasted 18 months, starting with baseline measures, succeeded by a 6-week meditation intervention, and follow-up assessments every 3 months. Results: The fixed effect of resilience was significant, as was the interaction between resilience and time, indicating different mental health symptom trajectories during and after a meditation intervention based on resilience. Conclusions: Participants low in resilience tended to have the greatest gains (increased subjective well-being and decreased depressive symptoms) following a meditation intervention, yet these gains were not maintained 18 months following the intervention. Those high in resilience did not show mental health gains following a meditation intervention but did have higher subjective well-being symptoms 18 months following the intervention indicating that they may have experienced delayed gains.

AB  - Background: Theoretically, mindfulness or the non-judgmental awareness of the present generates eudaimonic well-being. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective for addictions like alcohol-dependence but its well-being outcomes should be validated empirically. Objectives: Current pilot study intended to explore the feasibility of a novel intervention, Mindfulness-Based Eudaimonic Enhancement Training (MEET), among individuals undergoing treatment for alcohol-dependence at an Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts (IRCA), Kerala, India. Methods: The experimental group (N=12) was administered with the intervention and Treatment as Usual (TaU) while the control group (N=12) received TaU alone. Obtained data were analysed using independent sample t-test and paired sample t-test. Results: After intervention the experimental group had reported better mindfulness, eudaimonic well-being, hedonic well-being, and flourishing. The results delineate the efficacy of the intervention as a mindfulness-based positive psychology intervention that enhances well-being and flourishing. Conclusion: This is the first study reporting the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention aimed exclusively at eudaimonic enhancement that showed promising impact among individuals with alcohol-dependence. The study contributes to the existing scientific literature, on the role of well-being and its enhancement for the effective treatment of addiction and relapse prevention.

AB  - Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disabilities (IDs) can be stressful for many parents. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) is a customized mindfulness program that enables parents and other caregivers to reduce their perceived psychological stress to normative levels through mindfulness procedures and to support children with ASD or ID to self-manage their challenging behaviors through positive behavior support (PBS). In this study, we evaluated whether MBPBS would have differential effects on the stress levels of mothers of adolescents with ASD (n = 47) or with ID (n = 45) and the effects of the program on the aggressive, disruptive, and compliance behaviors of their children. Both groups of mothers participated in the 40-week study (10 weeks control and 30 weeks MBPBS program), rated their own stress levels, and collected daily observational data on the adolescents’ behavior. Results showed significant reductions in the level of stress in both groups of mothers, but no differential effects on mothers of children with ASD or with ID. In addition, significant reductions in aggression and disruptive behavior and increases in compliance behaviors were observed in the adolescents in both groups. The results suggest that MBPBS is equally beneficial for mothers of adolescents with ASD or ID. In the present study, although the mothers of children with ID had slightly higher levels of stress at baseline and mothers of children with ASD had lower levels of stress following the MBPBS program, the program can be considered equally effective in reducing the stress levels of both groups of mothers. This suggests that the program may be effective regardless of baseline levels of mothers’ stress. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a popular contemplative mental practice. Its purpose is to cultivate feelings of compassion, love, and prosocial motivation, typically through inner visual imagery and benevolent intentions. Previous studies have revealed evidence for various constructive effects of LKM. It remains an open question, however, whether the effects of LKM are exclusively positive in all practitioners. To tackle this question, we collected 55 microphenomenological interviews (MpIs) reflecting subjective experiences during LKM. Furthermore, we obtained psychological and biological (oxytocin, cortisol) inter-individual difference measures during a nine-month, longitudinal, mental training study. LKM was predominantly described in positive affective terms and associated with cortisol decrease in accordance with the natural diurnal decline, which reflects its generally non-stressful nature. However, five participants reported experiences such as panic, sadness, and fear. Emotional challenge, as indicated by negative word use during MpIs, was linked to lower scores of self-kindness and higher scores of self-compassionate mindfulness.

AB  - Objectives: Social approach and avoidance goals—which refer to individual differences in the desire to pursue rewards versus avoid negative experiences in social relationships—have numerous implications for the health and quality of social relationships. Although endorsement of these goals largely arises from people’s pre-dispositions towards approach and avoidance, in this research, we proposed that meditation training has the potential to beneficially influence the extent to which people adopt approach and avoidance goals. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals who were randomly assigned to receive training in mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation would report differences in social approach and avoidance goals, as compared with those in a wait-list control condition, and that these effects would be mediated by differences in positive and negative emotions. Methods: To examine these hypotheses, we drew upon a community-based, randomized intervention study of 138 midlife adults, who were assigned to receive mindfulness training, loving-kindness training, or no training in meditation. Results: As compared with the control condition, results demonstrated that loving-kindness training was directly associated with lower social avoidance goals, and indirectly associated with greater social approach goals, via enhanced positive emotion. Conclusions: These results suggest loving-kindness meditation is a means by which people can beneficially influence their approach and avoidance tendencies, which likely plays an important role in enhancing their social relationships.

AB  - The need for social connection is a fundamental human motive, and it is increasingly clear that feeling socially connected confers mental and physical health benefits. However, in many cultures, societal changes are leading to growing social distrust and alienation. Can feelings of social connection and positivity toward others be increased? Is it possible to self-generate these feelings? In this study, the authors used a brief loving-kindness meditation exercise to examine whether social connection could be created toward strangers in a controlled laboratory context. Compared with a closely matched control task, even just a few minutes of loving-kindness meditation increased feelings of social connection and positivity toward novel individuals on both explicit and implicit levels. These results suggest that this easily implemented technique may help to increase positive social emotions and decrease social isolation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The article discusses effectiveness of apps that address loneliness in adolescents and young adults. Nod is a mobile app co-developed by Grit Digital Health and Hopelab, designed to prevent loneliness in early young-adulthood during the transition to college. Based in positive psychology, mindfulness-based self-compassion, and cognitive-behavioral coping skills, Nod has three key features: (1) social challenges—suggested ideas for reaching out to others and taking action to build social connections; (2) reflections—short in-app exercises that help students process social experiences and reduce self-criticism; and (3) written student testimonials that encourage a growth mindset toward social connection building. Nod has been adapted for use by college students who are on campus, virtual, or both by offering options for challenges that include both virtual and safe in-person connections. In 2019, a randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of Nod with 221 students entering their first year of college. The results suggest that Nod use buffered students from increased loneliness and related problems adjusting to college. +Connect is a 6-week smartphone intervention that uses a strength-based positive psychology framework targeting loneliness severity in young people. Over a two-year development cycle (2015–2017), young people aged 18 to 25 participated in a series of focus groups to inform the design and delivery of +Connect and was initially trialed in young people with psychosis. The pilot demonstrated that +Connect is a safe and feasible tool that may benefit lonely young people, but that those with social anxiety disorder in particular may require more tailored support. The findings support further modification and testing of a second iterative version, renamed Peer Tree, with a pilot randomized controlled trial.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14[1236746] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record [rid]2023-92941-001[/rid]). In the published article, there was an error in Affiliation 3. The affiliation was listed as 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center Japan, Tokyo, Japan' but should be 'Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.' Affiliation 3 has now been updated. There was also an error in the results section: 'one meditation awareness training (acceptance commitment therapy: ACT)' should be 'one meditation awareness training (MAT) intervention.' A correction has been made to Results, Mindfulness. The corrected section is shown in the erratum. There was also an error in Table 1 as published. The corrected table is provided.] Objectives: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve subjective well-being (SWB), including evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of quality of life (QOL) of working population. Methods: A literature search was conducted, using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. Eligible studies included those that were RCTs of any intervention, conducted among healthy workers, measured SWB as a primary outcome, and original articles in English. Study characteristics, intervention, outcomes, and results on SWB outcomes were extracted by the investigators independently. After a brief narrative summarizing and classifying the contents of the interventions, the included outcomes were categorized into each aspect of SWB (evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of QOL). Finally, the characteristics of the effective interventions for increasing each aspect were summarized, and the pooled effect of interventions on SWB was investigated by a meta-analysis. Publication bias was investigated by drawing a funnel plot and conducting Egger's test. Results: From the 5,450 articles found, 39 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The interventions included in this review were classified into six categories (physical activity, ergonomics, psychological, environmental, multicomponent intervention, and others). The meta-analysis from 31 studies showed that the pooled effect of included interventions on SWB was significantly positive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.51; standard error (SE) = 0.10). A funnel plot showed there were extremely large or small SMDs, and Egger's test was significant. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analysis, excluding these extreme SMDs, and confirmed that the estimated pooled effect was also significantly positive. Subgroup analyses for separate types of interventions showed the effects of psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) were also significantly positive. Conclusion: The current study revealed the effectiveness of interventions for increasing SWB. Specifically, psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) may be useful for improving SWB.

AB  - Previous studies have found that gifted children experience symptoms such as existential anguish, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion. The inherent intensity and sensitivity of these young people may make them more susceptible to significant emotional distress and existential concerns. Endeavoring to address such issues, we designed a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, called the 'Atención plena para altas capacidades' (APAC; Mindfulness for Giftedness). This paper presents the pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up findings on the implementation of the program in a sample of 22 gifted children in Spain. The program comprised eight weekly 90-min group sessions covering mindfulness, emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, acceptance, values, compassion, and self-compassion. The program’s efficacy was measured using standardized, validated tools (the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the Children’s Depression Inventory, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children, and the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire) at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up time periods.. Our study’s findings at the posttreatment stage suggested that the APAC program improved the emotional abilities and reduced negative symptoms. Results from the 12-month follow-up assessment stage appeared to uphold these findings. However, we recommend that future second-generation mindfulness-based interventions for gifted children should include more activities and exercises that address the meaning of life and other related existential worries of particular concern to these young people.

AB  - Objectives: Elucidating the active ingredients of psychological treatments is an important step in the scientific validation of these interventions. Component studies are one way to test which aspects of psychological treatments impact outcomes or, in other words, are the active ingredients of treatment. As research and popular interest in mindfulness-based programs grows, it is important to evaluate the active ingredients of these programs and to continually refine theorized models of the mechanisms of mindfulness. Studying active ingredients may help clarify which elements of mindfulness-based programs are most important for dissemination. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of component studies of mindfulness-based programs for adults with psychological conditions. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Results: Eight component studies were identified. These studies dismantled mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, unified mindfulness, and core mindfulness processes. The eight studies differed with respect to types of programs and populations studied, yet similarities emerged. Notably, acceptance coupled with awareness and mindfulness meditation training may be two promising active ingredients of these different programs. Conclusions: Future studies examining mindfulness-based programs should continue to attempt to dismantle active ingredients of treatment and use the findings to update theoretical models of mindfulness.

AB  - Comments on an article by B. E. Kok et al. (see record [rid]2013-25504-006[/rid]). Kok et al. examined the relations among change in positive emotions, change in perceived social connections, and change in vagal tone in a longitudinal field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to either a control condition or an intervention condition. Participants in the intervention condition 'self-generated' positive emotions by practicing loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Kok et al. claimed to have demonstrated support for their three hypotheses. On the basis of these findings, they recommended that the practice of LKM be added to the armamentarium of advice for improving physical health, for which they asserted that vagal tone is an objective marker. I believe that Kok et al. have overstated their findings and that those findings do not justify their recommendation. This overstatement can be demonstrated from two different vantage points. First, Kok et al.’s findings depended on the inclusion in their sample of a small number of unusual participants. Second, few participants had a pattern of change in positive emotions, perceived social connections, and vagal tone that conformed to the upward spiral. I elaborate on each of these points in turn.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to uncover the day-to-day emotional profiles and dose-response relations, both within persons and between persons, associated with initiating one of two meditation practices, either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation. Data were pooled across two studies of midlife adults (N = 339) who were randomized to learn either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation in a 6-week workshop. The duration and frequency of meditation practice was measured daily for 9 weeks, commencing with the first workshop session. Likewise, positive and negative emotions were also measured daily, using the modified Differential Emotions Scale (Fredrickson, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 47:1–53, 2013). Analysis of daily emotion reports over the targeted 9-week period showed significant gains in positive emotions and no change in negative emotions, regardless of meditation type. Multilevel models also revealed significant dose-response relations between duration of meditation practice and positive emotions, both within persons and between persons. Moreover, the within-person dose-response relation was stronger for loving-kindness meditation than for mindfulness meditation. Similar dose-response relations were observed for the frequency of meditation practice. In the context of prior research on the mental and physical health benefits produced by subtle increases in day-to-day experiences of positive emotions, the present research points to evidence-based practices—both mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation—that can improve emotional well-being.

AB  - Meditation has shown to benefit a wide range of conditions and symptoms, but the neural mechanisms underlying the practice remain unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the structural brain changes due to the practice by examining volume, density, or cortical thickness changes. However, these studies have focused on adults; meditation’s structural effects on the adolescent brain remain understudied. In this study, we investigated how meditation training affects the structure of the adolescent brain by scanning a group of 38 adolescents (16.48 ± 1.29 years) before and after participating in a 12-week meditation training. Subjects underwent Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA), a program that mainly incorporates elements from mindfulness meditation and yoga-based practices. A subset of the adolescents also received an additional control scan 12 weeks before TARA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess gray matter volume changes pre- to post-training and during the control period. Subjects showed significant gray matter (GM) volume decreases in the left posterior insula and to a lesser extent in the left thalamus and left putamen after meditation training. There were no significant changes during the control period. Our results support previous findings that meditation affects regions associated with physical and emotional awareness. However, our results are different from previous morphometric studies in which meditation was associated with structural increases. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the differences between the adolescent brain and the adult brain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present research tested whether mindfulness, a state characterized by focused, nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, increases prosocial behavior in the workplace or work-related contexts. Study 1a was a longitudinal field experiment at a US insurance company. Compared to workers under waitlist control, employees who were assigned to a daily mindfulness training reported more helping behaviors over a five day period both in quantitative surveys and qualitative daily diaries. Study 1b, conducted in a large consulting company in India, extends these findings with a field experiment in which co-workers rated the prosocial behavior of teammates in a round robin design. Moving from devoting time to devoting money, in Studies 2a and 2b we find that individuals randomly assigned to engage in a focused breathing meditation were more financially generous. To understand the mechanisms of mindfulness’ effects on prosocial behavior, Study 3 found support for empathy and moderate support for perspective taking as mediators. This study also examined the effects of induced state mindfulness via two different mindfulness inductions, focused breathing and loving kindness meditation. Our results indicate that secular state mindfulness can make people more other-oriented and helpful. This benefit holds even in the workplace, where being helpful toward others might face constraints but is nevertheless of great importance.

AB  - Despite the connection between self-compassion, shame, and HIV/AIDS health outcomes in the literature, little is known about the relationship among these variables. Shame and self-compassion work independently of each other and experiences of shame can impede one’s ability to engage in self-compassionate responses, which could prevent future health declines. Although shame has been found to mediate the relationship between self-compassion and a variety of mental health outcomes, it has not been examined in the context of HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the current study was to examine how shame mediates the relationship of self-compassion and adherence to HIV/AIDS medications, as well as how shame mediates the relationship of self-compassion and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people living with HIV (PLWH). This is the first study to look at trait-based shame in PLWH in a sample of 34 patients at an urban outpatient integrated care facility for PLWH. Self-compassion was not correlated with HIV adherence behaviors or HRQL, and shame did not mediate the relationship between self-compassion and adherence or HRQL. However as expected, less shame was related to and predicted better HRQL in PLWH. Self-compassion’ relationship to shame, adherence, and HRQL may be context dependent.

AB  - Objective: This project investigated same-day and lagged (i.e., from one day to the next) associations between daily positive affect and three distinct positive health behaviours: physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and meditation. Cross-day analyses also examined the role of positive affect felt during the targeted health behaviours. Design: Secondary data analyses used a 9-week daily diary study in which midlife adults (N = 217) were randomized to learn one of two contemplative practices (i.e., mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation) while reporting nightly on their emotions and health behaviours. Results: Results of same-day analyses revealed positive associations, both between-person and within-person, for the three positive health behaviours with daily positive affect. Results of lagged analyses revealed that positive affect experienced during fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day fruit and vegetable intake, and that fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day positive affect. Conclusion: The observed same-day relations between daily positive affect and engagement in positive health behaviours illuminate one path through which positive affect may contribute to health. The observed cross-day relations reveal a need for interdisciplinary research on mechanisms through which fruit and vegetable intake may shape next-day positive affect.

AB  - Recent studies showed mixed findings regarding the sustainability of the effects of mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation interventions. This study, conducted on a sample of 128 management students divided into treatment and control groups, is the first that examines the long-term effects of the training in relational mindfulness. We focus on Relational Mindfulness Training (RMT), an 8-week intervention designed to help participants to be more present, aware, and kind towards themselves and others during social interactions. The results show a significant long-term impact of RMT on self-compassion, perceived stress and mindfulness. The impact of RMT on compassion and subjective happiness was significant in the short run, but only marginally significant in the long run for compassion and non-significant for subjective happiness. Furthermore, individuals who maintained an individual practice in the follow-up period showed notably better results concerning all examined effects, except compassion. The results suggest that the development of compassion is more dependent on the context of a training group. We provide recommendations for future interventions in order that they can make a more sustainable impact on compassion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose of review: People with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) commonly exhibit behaviors that present challenges to their parents, caregivers, and teachers. Mindfulness-based practices and programs have emerged as a viable alternative to current interventions for such behaviors and the stress faced by their caregivers. This review addresses publications between 2018 and 2019 that examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based practices and programs for people living with IDD. Recent findings: Individuals with IDD can learn mindfulness practices to self-manage their aggressive and destructive behaviors. Individual practices and group-based programs continue to show that mindfulness approaches are effective for this population. Randomized controlled trials indicate that comprehensive mindfulness-based programs (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction, MYmind, and mindfulness-based positive behavior support) are effective for enhancing the quality of life of people living with IDD. Summary: Research supports the use of informal mindfulness practices for challenging behaviors of people with IDD. Formal mindfulness-based programs continue to be evaluated for their effectiveness across different populations, cultures, levels of IDD, components of the program, and length of training. The research literature on mindfulness is still in the early stages of development and much work remains. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In a recent study, Gebauer et al. addressed a fundamental question regarding the effects of mind-body practices (MBPs) on the self. Does the practice of MBPs in accordance with traditional contemplative traditions quiet the ego or is the practice of MBPs associated with increased self-centrality, which breeds self-enhancement bias? Both hypotheses were investigated in two separate studies with a longitudinal design. Study 1 included 93 participants, who regularly practiced yoga, and study 2 contained 162 participants, who regularly practiced loving-kindness meditation. In both studies, trait questionnaires of self-centrality and self-enhancement were taken after the practice of yoga (over the course of 15 weeks) or meditation (over the course of 4 weeks). Findings from both studies showed that participants scored higher on measures of self-enhancement and self-centrality after practicing yoga and meditation as compared with not practicing yoga and meditation. Based on these findings, Gebauer et al. argued that MBPs such as yoga and meditation do not quiet the ego, but instead lead to self-enhancement bias through increased self-centrality. We have concerns about the far-reaching conclusions made by Gebauer et al. regarding the effects of MBPs on the self. The key concerns refer to the conceptualization of the quiet ego and to the assessment of the psychological constructs investigated in this study. Gebauer et al. addressed a timely and important research question, but their far-reaching interpretations should be reconsidered due to conceptual and methodological ambiguities.

AB  - Theoretical and neurophysiological investigations into compassion are burgeoning, yet the putative neural mechanisms which underpin such processes are less well understood. Therefore, we have conducted an Activation-Likelihood Estimate meta-analysis in order to ascertain the shared neural processes consistently identified as relevant to compassion. Our analysis of sixteen fMRI studies revealed activation across seven broad regions, with the largest peaks localized to the Periaqueductal Grey, Anterior Insula, Anterior Cingulate, and Inferior Frontal Gyrus. Overall, we identified a tendency for studies to operationalize compassion in one of three ways, as driven either ‘top-down’, ‘bottom-up’, or modified by target context. We failed to identify regions purportedly common to compassion such as the DLPFC, OFC, and Amygdala, possibly due to a small number of studies which used Loving-Kindness meditation. We argue future research in compassion science continue a multi-modal approach to examine links between neural activity and actual prosocial behavior, and recommend the application of fMRI paradigms on compassion with clinically diagnosed populations to parallel current trends in psychotherapy such as Compassion Focused Therapy.

AB  - Mainstream mindfulness programs, as in first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, generally do not incorporate Buddhist ethics, causing some scholars to worry that they may encourage self-indulgence and have limited capacity to promote well-being. We compare the effects of practicing mindfulness with additional ethical instruction (EthicalM) or without such instruction (SecularM) on well-being and prosocial behavior. Participants (N = 621) completed 6 days of ethical or secular mindfulness exercises or active control exercises. Secular and ethical mindfulness both reduced stress (EthicalM: p = 0.011, d = −0.25; SecularM: p = 0.005, d = −0.28) and increased life satisfaction (EthicalM: p = 0.008, d = 0.26; SecularM: p = 0.069, d = 0.18) and self-awareness (EthicalM: p = 0.011, d = 0.25; SecularM: p = 0.051, d = 0.19). Ethical mindfulness also enhanced personal growth (p = 0.032, d = 0.21). Ethical, relative to secular, mindfulness also increased prosocial behavior—money donated to a charity (p = 0.020, d = 0.24). This effect was moderated by trait empathy: Trait empathy predicted donation amounts for participants who had completed mindfulness exercises (ethical or secular) but not controls. Furthermore, low trait empathy participants gave significantly less money following secular mindfulness practice than control exercises, whereas high trait empathy participants gave more money following ethical mindfulness practice than control exercises. Mindfulness training may thus have unintended consequences, making some people less charitable, though incorporating instruction on ethics, as in some second-generation mindfulness-based interventions, may forestall such effects.

AB  - Recent research has shown that integrating social and clinical psychological perspectives can be effective when designing prejudice-interventions, with psychotherapeutic techniques successful at tackling anxiety in intergroup contexts. This research tests whether a single, brief loving-kindness meditation intervention, without containing any reference to the intergroup context, could reduce prejudice. This exercise was selected for its proven positive effects on mental and physical health. We observed that participants who took part in two variations of this meditation exercise (one involving a stranger, the other a homeless person) reported reduced intergroup anxiety, as well as more positive explicit attitudes, and enhanced future contact intentions. We conclude that combining approaches in intergroup relations and psychotherapy could be beneficial to design new interventions to combat prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - The effect of a 6‐week loving‐kindness meditation (LKM) on the multidimensional empathy of 103 master's‐level counseling students was evaluated, in addition to the correlation between reported levels of time spent meditating and empathy. Statistical analyses indicated that participants who received the LKM intervention experienced gains in dimensions of empathy. A significant relationship between quantity of meditation and perspective taking was noted. Implications and suggestions for future research are explored.

AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex and poorly understood psychosomatic pain disorder. The illness has been the subject of controversy, both in terms of the alleged lack of interest and capability of the medical community to understand and support patients with FMS, and the burden that such individuals place upon economic and healthcare resources. Due to the lack of convincing data for the effectiveness of extant pharmacological and non-pharmacological FMS treatments, a recent direction in FMS research has been the empirical investigation of mindfulness and other meditation-based approaches. The present qualitative study explored whether following participation in a mindfulness-based intervention, patients with FMS report experiencing changes in (i) how they experience and relate to their illness and (ii) their attitudes towards societal participation, work and unemployment. Ten individuals with FMS were randomly selected from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) for the treatment of FMS. Transcripts of semi-structured interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, a robust and rigorous qualitative methodology for analysing subjective experiences. Five super-ordinate themes emerged from the dataset: (i) reservations about participating, (ii) improvements in psychosomatic well-being, (iii) spiritual growth, (iv) awareness of impermanence and (v) increased sense of citizenship. MAT was experienced as both an acceptable and accessible intervention by individuals with FMS, and participants reported experiencing improvements in psychosocial functioning as well as an increased sense of societal responsibility. MAT appears to have utility for treating FMS and for changing the attitudes of some individuals with FMS towards community engagement and societal contribution.

AB  - The relationship between positive emotions and implicit racial prejudice is unclear. Interventions using positive emotions to reduce racial bias have been found wanting, while other research shows that positive affect can sometimes exacerbate implicit prejudice. Nevertheless, loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has shown some promise as a method of reducing bias despite increasing a broad range of positive emotions. A randomised control trial (n = 69) showed that a short-term induction of LKM decreased automatic processing, increased controlled processing, and was sufficient to reduce implicit prejudice towards the target’s racial group but not towards a group untargeted by the meditation. Furthermore, the reduction in bias was shown to be mediated by other-regarding positive emotions alongside increased control and decreased automaticity on the IAT. Non-other-regarding positive emotions conversely showed no correlation with bias. The study is the first to show that a short-term positive emotional induction can reduce racial prejudice, and aids the understanding of how positive emotions functionally differentiate in affecting bias.

AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness-based approaches to meditation usually rely on not one but several specific techniques or elements, but what elements are responsible for which of the commonly found positive effects is not yet known. To help answer this question, we compared the effects of three different meditation techniques that are commonly used in mindfulness-based approaches. Methods: Fifty-six students with no prior meditation experience participated in a breathing, body scan, or loving-kindness meditation condition. Participants followed meditation instructions that they were given on audio files, for daily practice and weekly meetings over a period of 6 weeks. Dependent variables were mindfulness, concentration, self-compassion, emotional regulation and experience, and life satisfaction. Results: The body scan meditation condition reported greater effects on almost all dependent variables than those in the breathing meditation condition with effect sizes from β = .16 to .61. The group showed the highest increase in the mindfulness dimension acceptance but not presence. Loving-kindness meditation showed higher effect sizes in concentration than the breathing meditation group. Conclusions: Specific meditation techniques may have effects other than expected on psychological variables. Considering the limitations of this study, further research is needed to assess the specific effects of single mindfulness techniques. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Traditional moral philosophy has long focused on rationality, principled thinking, and good old-fashioned willpower, but recent evidence strongly suggests that moral judgments and prosocial behavior are more heavily influenced by emotion and intuition. As the evidence mounts, rational traditions emphasizing deliberative analysis and conscious decision making are called into question. The first section highlights some compelling evidence supporting the primacy of affective states in motivating moral judgments and behavior. The real challenge is finding a way to align intuition with desired behavior. In cool reflective states, one may desire to be a kind and loving person. But when it is time to act, the moment is often accompanied by strong affect-laden intuitions. I argue that if affective states are the primary motivators of behavior, then moral sentiments must be trained through habituation in order to increase prosocial behavior. The second section provides empirical evidence linking emotional training with increased prosociality. To highlight this connection, focus is placed on the relationship between habitual meditation training, compassion, and prosocial behavior. Recent studies by Antoine Lutz, Richard Davidson, Susanne Leiberg, and others show that various meditation practices can dramatically affect the human person at various levels, i.e., increased physical health, neural restructuring, regulation and development of emotions, and increased helping behavior, to name a few. The current article focuses on the impact the habit of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has on compassion and prosocial behavior. Recent studies strongly support the conclusion that LKM training hones compassion and ultimately leads to an increase in compassionate behavior.

AB  - There is an increasing number of young adults living at home with their parents, and this can lead to tension and conflict in the family home. One way to help increase the pro-social interactions and connectedness between young adults and their parents is with using Loving-Kindness Meditations (LKM). There is considerable evidence suggesting that LKM, which is a cultivation of good-will for self and others, can have many direct benefits on psychological distress and interpersonal interactions, and can indirectly increase self-compassion. This study examined the effects of using a 15-min Loving-Kindness Meditation for young adults living. A total of 97 participants (79 female, mean age = 18.64 years), were randomly allocated to LKM or a Focused Imagery control. Participants completed measures examining self-compassion, compassion motivation, and emotional, cognitive and interpersonal responses to vignettes describing conflict between young adults and their parents. As predicted, compared to controls, young adults who received LKM were higher in motivation to be self-compassionate, however, there was no difference in levels of self-compassion. Initial fear of self-compassion influenced emotional responses on the vignettes. The findings suggest that self-compassion could assist young adults in managing their own internal distress when interacting with their parents.

AB  - While it has been suggested that loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is an effective practice for promoting positive emotions, the empirical evidence in the literature remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic review of 24 empirical studies (N = 1759) on LKM with self-reported positive emotions. The effect of LKM on positive emotions was estimated with meta-analysis, and the influence of variations across LKM interventions was further explored with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed that (1) medium effect sizes for LKM interventions on daily positive emotions in both wait-list controlled RCTs and non-RCT studies; and (2) small to large effect sizes for the on-going practice of LKM on immediate positive emotions across different comparisons. Further analysis showed that (1) interventions focused on loving-kindness had medium effect size, but interventions focused on compassion showed small effect sizes; (2) the length of interventions and the time spent on meditation did not influence the effect sizes, but the studies without didactic components in interventions had small effect sizes. A few individual studies reported that the nature of positive emotions and individual differences also influenced the results. In sum, LKM practice and interventions are effective in enhancing positive emotions, but more studies are needed to identify the active components of the interventions, to compare different psychological operations, and to explore the applicability in clinical populations.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental condition characterized by a range of cognitive and behavioral vulnerabilities, including chronic shame and deficits in social problem solving (SPS) abilities. Little research however, has examined strategies that may alleviate shame and SPS deficits among individuals with BPD traits. Using a laboratory experimental approach, the present study compared the effects of a brief mindfulness versus loving-kindness meditation (LKM) induction on shame and SPS abilities in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. Eighty-eight participants underwent a shame induction procedure involving recall of a negative autobiographical memory. They were then randomly assigned to 10 min of mindful breathing or LKM, or a no-instruction condition. Shame and SPS abilities were assessed via visual analogue scales and the Means-Ends Problem Solving task respectively. Results indicated that there were significant decreases in shame from pre-to post-regulation in the mindfulness group versus the LKM and no-instruction groups. Groups did not differ on changes in SPS abilities from pre-to post-regulation. Overall, the findings support the efficacy of mindfulness as a strategy to regulate shame among individuals with BPD traits, and raises questions with regard to the utility of LKM in modulating shame in the context of high emotional arousal.

AB  - Although loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has shown some promise as a psychological intervention, little is known about the effectiveness of LKM for reducing one of the most prevalent mental health problems: anxiety. To build knowledge in this area, we conducted a randomized controlled trial, assigning non-clinical undergraduates to either a four-session, group-based LKM intervention (n = 38) or a waitlist control (n = 33). Self-reported anxiety, compassionate love, and self-compassion were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 8-week follow-up. Relative to control participants, participants in the LKM intervention reported higher compassionate love and self-compassion at posttreatment and higher self-kindness (a component of self-compassion) at follow-up. Anxiety ratings did not significantly differ between conditions at posttreatment or follow-up. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - An experiment involving 115 undergraduate students (74.8% females; mean age = 20.5 years, SD = 4.3) was conducted to explore effects of meditation on social connectedness, nature connectedness, and affect. Participants listened to one of three brief guided meditation Mp3 recordings via the internet, which involved mindfulness meditation (MM), loving-kindness meditation (LKM), or progressive muscle relaxation (active control group). Participants in the MM and LKM groups reported greater social and nature connectedness at post-test than those in the control group. There were no significant differences in connectedness between the MM and LKM groups, suggesting they are both effective for enhancing connectedness. There were no significant changes in negative or positive affect at post-test due to the interventions. Recommendations for future research are provided.
