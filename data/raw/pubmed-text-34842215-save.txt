TI  - Mindfulness meditation training in an occupational setting: Effects of a 12-weeks
      mindfulness-based intervention on wellbeing.
PG  - 1089-1099
LID - 10.3233/WOR-210510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are known for their beneficial
      effects on positive and negative psychological factors. When applied in an
      occupational context, MBIs might help workers to cope with stress, increase their
      professional outcomes and wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: In this two-groups pre-post
      experimental design we tested the effect of our MBI, called Integral Meditation
      (IM), among the employers of an Italian service company by measuring positive and
      negative aspects of psychological wellbeing related to mindfulness and workplace
      functioning through eight self-report questionnaires (CORE-OM, FFMQ, WEMWBS,
      MAIA, PSS, PANAS, STAI-X1, SCS). METHOD: Forty-two voluntary non-clinical
      employers of the company, randomly assigned to the experimental or the control
      group, were analyzed. The experimental group underwent our IM program, which
      consists of 12 weekly meditation classes given after the afternoon shift, while
      the control group did not receive any intervention. Data was analyzed via linear
      mixed models. RESULTS: Statistically significant results were obtained for FFMQ
      observing subscale (β= 0.49, p = 0.014), WEMWBS (β= 5.31, p = 0.02), PSS
      (β= -3.31, p = 0.03), the whole scale of SCS (β= 0.47, p = 0.01) and
      self-judgment (β= 0.68, p = 0.003) and isolation (β= -0.66, p = 0.01) SCS
      subscales. Statistically significant results were also found in four out of eight
      subscales of MAIA: emotional awareness (β= 1.26, p < 0.001), self-regulation
      (β= 1.28, p < 0.001), body listening (β= 1.08, p < 0.001) and trusting (β= 1.1,
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our intervention has demonstrated to bring beneficial
      effects in a mindfulness subdomain, in perceived stress, self-compassion,
      interoception and psychological wellbeing. Based on our results, we conclude that
      our intervention was effective in increasing the positive aspects of wellbeing
      and in reducing stress.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions for University Students: A Systematic Review and
      Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.
PG  - 384-410
LID - 10.1111/aphw.12188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: University students are expressing an increased need for mental
      health support. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are being integrated into
      university stress-reduction programmes globally. We conducted a comprehensive
      systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
      assessing MBI effects on university students' mental and physical health.
      METHODS: We searched nine databases, including grey literature and trial
      registries. Two independent reviewers extracted data following a prospective
      public protocol. RESULTS: Fifty-one RCTs were included. In comparison with
      passive controls, and when measured shortly after intervention completion, MBIs
      improve distress, anxiety, depression, well-being, rumination, and mindfulness
      with small to moderate effect sizes, with no benefit found for blood pressure,
      sleep, life satisfaction, resilience, worry, and thought suppression. Evidence
      for self-compassion is inconclusive. Effects last beyond three months for
      distress and mindfulness, with no data on other outcomes. Compared with active
      control groups, MBIs significantly improve distress and state anxiety, but not
      mindfulness, depression, well-being, affect, trait anxiety, or emotion
      regulation. Results were robust to adjustment for multiple testing, but RCTs'
      risk of bias is generally high. Moderator analyses did not find differential
      intervention effects according to intervention duration, delivery mode, or
      sub-populations. CONCLUSIONS: MBIs may be helpful to students but higher-quality
      research is needed.

AB  - Increased levels of self-criticism and a lack of self-compassion have been
      associated with the development and maintenance of a range of psychological
      disorders. In the current study, we tested the efficacy of an online version of a
      compassion-focused intervention, mindfulness-based compassionate living (MBCL),
      with guidance on request. A total of 122 self-referred participants with
      increased levels of self-criticism were randomly assigned to care as usual (CAU)
      or the intervention group (CAU + online intervention). Primary endpoints were
      self-reported depressive, anxiety and distress symptoms (DASS-21) and
      self-compassion (SCS) at 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints were self-criticism,
      mindfulness, satisfaction with life, fear of self-compassion, self-esteem, and
      existential shame. At posttreatment, the intervention group showed significant
      changes with medium to large effect sizes compared to the control group regarding
      primary outcomes (Cohen's d: 0.79 [DASS] and -1.21 [SCS]) and secondary outcomes
      (Cohen's ds: between 0.40 and 0.94 in favor of the intervention group). The
      effects in the intervention group were maintained at 6-months postrandomization.
      Adherence measures (number of completed modules, self-reported number of
      completed exercises per week) predicted postintervention scores for
      self-compassion but not for depressive, anxiety, and distress symptoms in the
      intervention group. The current study shows the efficacy of an online
      intervention with a transdiagnostic intervention target on a broad range of
      measures, including depressive and anxiety symptoms and self-compassion.

AB  - Compassion meditation (CM) is a promising intervention for enhancing compassion,
      although its active ingredients and neurobiological mechanisms are not
      well-understood. To investigate these, we conducted a three-armed
      placebo-controlled randomized trial (N = 57) with longitudinal functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared a 4-week CM program delivered by
      smartphone application with (i) a placebo condition, presented to participants as
      the compassion-enhancing hormone oxytocin, and (ii) a condition designed to
      control for increased familiarity with suffering others, an element of CM which
      may promote compassion. At pre- and post-intervention, participants listened to
      compassion-eliciting narratives describing suffering others during fMRI. CM
      increased brain responses to suffering others in the medial orbitofrontal cortex
      (mOFC) relative to the familiarity condition, p < 0.05 family-wise error rate
      corrected. Among CM participants, individual differences in increased mOFC
      responses positively correlated with increased compassion-related feelings and
      attributions, r = 0.50, p = 0.04. Relative to placebo, the CM group exhibited a
      similar increase in mOFC activity at an uncorrected threshold of P < 0.001 and 10
      contiguous voxels. We conclude that the mOFC, a region closely related to
      affiliative affect and motivation, is an important brain mechanism of CM. Effects
      of CM on mOFC function are not explained by familiarity effects and are partly
      explained by placebo effects.

AB  - Although research has suggested that body image improves following
      self-compassion meditation training, studies have been limited due to the use of
      a wait-list control group. This study therefore compared the effects of
      self-compassion meditations to an active control group. Seventy young adult women
      (17-35 years) were randomly assigned to receive either self-compassion or
      nature-focused guided imagery meditations. Over one week, participants engaged in
      two meditations and completed pre- and post-test measures of trait
      self-compassion, body appreciation, body shame, and appearance-contingent
      self-worth. A mixed design analysis of variance revealed a main effect of time;
      women in both meditation groups demonstrated significant increases in
      self-compassion and body appreciation, and significant reductions in body shame.
      No effect was found for appearance-contingent self-worth. There were no
      interactions or main effects for group. Self-compassion may improve body image in
      women, although there was no evidence for an advantage of self-compassion over
      guided imagery meditations. Common elements between self-compassion and guided
      imagery may be a mechanism for improving body image. However, further research is
      warranted to isolate the effects of these meditations from other specific and
      non-specific treatment effects. (This study was pre-registered with the
      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618001814268).

TI  - Fostering Self-Compassion and Loving-Kindness in Patients With Borderline
      Personality Disorder: A Randomized Pilot Study.
PG  - 278-286
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2000 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this randomized pilot study is to investigate the effects of a short
      training programme in loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKM/CM) in
      patients with borderline personality disorder. Patients were allocated to LKM/CM
      or mindfulness continuation training (control group). Patients in the LKM/CM
      group showed greater changes in Acceptance compared with the control group.
      Remarkable changes in borderline symptomatology, self-criticism and self-kindness
      were also observed in the LKM/CM group. Mechanistic explanations and therapeutic
      implications of the findings are discussed. HIGHLIGHTS: Three weeks of
      loving-kindness and compassion meditations increased acceptance of the
      present-moment experience in patients with borderline personality disorder.
      Significant improvements in the severity of borderline symptoms, self-criticism,
      mindfulness, acceptance and self-kindness were observed after the LKM/CM
      intervention. LKM/CM is a promising complementary strategy for inclusion in
      mindfulness-based interventions and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy for treating
      core symptoms in borderline personality disorder. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &

TI  - A wait-list randomized controlled trial of loving-kindness meditation programme
      for self-criticism.
PG  - 346-56
LID - 10.1002/cpp.1893 [doi]
AB  - Self-criticism is a vulnerability risk factor for a number of psychological
      disorders, and it predicts poor response to psychological and pharmacological
      treatments. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a loving-kindness
      meditation (LKM) programme designed to increase self-compassion in a sample of
      self-critical individuals. Thirty-eight individuals with high scores on the
      self-critical perfectionism subscale of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale were
      randomized to an LKM condition (n = 19) or a wait-list (WL) condition (n = 19).
      Measures of self-criticism, self-compassion and psychological distress were
      administered before and immediately following the intervention (LKM or WL). WL
      participants received the intervention immediately after the waiting period. Both
      groups were assessed 3 months post-intervention. Intent-to-treat (n = 38) and
      per-protocol analyses (n = 32) showed significant reductions in self-criticism
      and depressive symptoms as well as significant increases in self-compassion and
      positive emotions in the LKM condition compared with the WL condition. A
      follow-up per-protocol analysis in both groups together (n = 20) showed that
      these gains were maintained 3 months after the intervention. These preliminary
      results suggest that LKM may be efficacious in alleviating self-criticism,
      increasing self-compassion and improving depressive symptoms among self-critical
      individuals. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Self-criticism plays a major role in many
      psychological disorders and predicts poor response to brief psychological and
      pharmacological treatments for depression. The current study shows that
      loving-kindness meditation, designed to foster self-compassion, is efficacious in
      helping self-critical individuals become less self-critical and more
      self-compassionate. The study also suggests that practising loving-kindness may
      reduce depressive symptoms and increase positive emotions.

AB  - This randomised controlled pilot trial tested a six-week mindfulness-based
      intervention in a sample of pregnant women experiencing high levels of perceived
      stress and pregnancy anxiety. Forty-seven women enrolled between 10 and 25 weeks
      gestation were randomly assigned to either a series of weekly Mindful Awareness
      Practices classes (n = 24) with home practice or to a reading control condition
      (n = 23). Hierarchical linear models of between-group differences in change over
      time demonstrated that participants in the mindfulness intervention experienced
      larger decreases from pre-to post-intervention in pregnancy-specific anxiety and
      pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) than participants in the reading control
      condition. However, these effects were not sustained through follow-up at six
      weeks post-intervention. Participants in both groups experienced increased
      mindfulness, as well as decreased perceived stress and state anxiety over the
      course of the intervention and follow-up periods. This study is one of the first
      randomised controlled pilot trials of a mindfulness meditation intervention
      during pregnancy and provides some evidence that mindfulness training during
      pregnancy may effectively reduce PRA and worry. We discuss some of the dilemmas
      in pursuing this translational strategy and offer suggestions for researchers
      interested in conducting mind-body interventions during pregnancy.

AB  - The potential health benefits of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion are
      well-documented. However, interventions that teach these principles typically
      rely on face-to-face delivery, which can limit their dissemination. Delivering
      these interventions through smartphone apps could help overcome this. This
      meta-analysis examined whether principles of acceptance, mindfulness, and
      self-compassion can be learned through smartphone apps. Twenty-seven randomized
      controlled trials were included. Smartphone apps that included acceptance and/or
      mindfulness components resulted in significantly higher levels of
      acceptance/mindfulness than comparison conditions (k = 33; g = 0.29; 95%
      CI = 0.17, 0.41). These effects were moderated by the type of comparison and
      whether reminders to engage were offered. Smartphone apps also resulted in
      significantly lower levels of psychological distress than comparisons (k = 22;
      g = -0.32; 95% CI = -0.48, -0.16). Meta-regression revealed a negative
      relationship between the effect sizes for mindfulness/acceptance and the effect
      sizes for distress. Smartphone apps produced significantly greater increases in
      self-compassion than comparisons (k = 9; g = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.56), although
      the quality of RCTs in this analysis was poor. Findings suggest that principles
      of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion may be learned through cheap,
      easily accessible, and low-intensity interventions delivered via smartphone apps.
      However, the quality of available evidence is poor, as low risk of bias was noted
      in few trials (18%) and the observed effects were likely explained by a digital
      placebo.

TI  - Mindfulness training for emotion dysregulation in multiple sclerosis: A pilot
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 206-218
LID - 10.1037/rep0000324 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) report greater emotion
      dysregulation, which is associated with increased symptoms of depression and
      anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Given the transdiagnostic significance of
      emotion dysregulation, the current study was designed to assess the feasibility
      and treatment effects of mindfulness meditation in reducing emotion dysregulation
      for PwMS. METHOD: Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 4-week
      mindfulness-based training (MBT), 4-week adaptive cognitive training (aCT), or a
      waitlist control group. Using self-report and behavioral measures, we examined
      the effects of MBT on emotion dysregulation, use of emotion regulation
      strategies, experience of negative and positive affect, and overall quality of
      life. RESULTS: Mindfulness training was associated with reduced emotion
      dysregulation compared with the adaptive cognitive training and the waitlist
      control group (η(p)² = .20). Relative to the waitlist group, the MBT group also
      demonstrated reductions on a composite score of preservative cognition, measuring
      rumination and worry (η(p)² = .15). However, there was no differential use of
      emotion regulation strategies or between-groups differences in overall quality of
      life as a function of training. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study provides preliminary
      support for MBT to reduce self-reported emotion dysregulation in PwMS. Given the
      widespread prevalence of mental health disturbances in this population, MBT can
      serve as a promising rehabilitation tool for PwMS (clinicaltrials.gov #
      NCT02717429). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

      participants in each arm. PARTICIPANTS: 90 New Zealand young people aged 16-30
      recruited via a social media advertising campaign. SETTING: Participants' homes.
      INTERVENTIONS: Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and refined from a
      prototype version that was evaluated during a smaller qualitative study, 'Whitu:
      seven ways in seven days' is a well-being app that, as its name suggests,
      contains seven modules to help young people (1) recognise and rate emotions, (2)
      learn relaxation and mindfulness, (3) practice self-compassion and (4) gratitude,
      (5) connect with others, (6) care for their physical health and (7) engage in
      goal-setting. It can be completed within a week or as desired. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in well-being on the WHO 5-item
      Well-Being Index and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Secondary
      outcomes were changes in depression on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies
      Depression Scale, anxiety on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale,
      self-compassion on the Self Compassion Scale-Short Form, stress on the 10-item
      Perceived Stress Scale, sleep on the single-item Sleep Quality Scale and user
      engagement on the end-user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and via
      qualitative feedback during an online survey. Outcomes were evaluated at
      baseline, 4 weeks (primary study endpoint) and 3 months, and analysed using
      linear mixed models with group, time and a group-time interaction. RESULTS: At 4
      weeks, participants in the Whitu group experienced significantly higher emotional
      (Mean difference (md) 13.19 (3.96 to 22.42); p=0.005) and mental (md 2.44 (0.27
      to 4.61); p=0.027) well-being, self-compassion (md 0.56 (0.28 to 0.83); p<0.001)
      and sleep (md 1.13 (0.24 to 2.02); p=0.018), and significantly lower stress (md
      -4.69 (-7.61 to -1.76); p=0.002) and depression (md -5.34 (-10.14 to -0.53);
      p=0.030), compared with the waitlist controls. Group differences remained
      statistically significant at 3 months for all outcomes. Symptoms of anxiety were
      also lower in the intervention group at 4 weeks (p=0.096), with statistically
      significant differences at 3 months (md -2.31 (-4.54 to -0.08); p=0.042).
      Usability of Whitu was high (subjective ratings of 4.45 (0.72) and 4.38 (0.79)
      out of 5 at 4 weeks and 3 months, respectively) and qualitative feedback
      indicated individual and cultural acceptability of the app. CONCLUSIONS: Given
      the evolving psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, Whitu could provide a
      clinically effective and scalable means of improving the well-being, mental
      health and resilience of young people. Replication of current findings with
      younger individuals and in other settings is planned. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Examining the Effects of Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment Training on
      Self-Compassion and Grit among Elite Female Athletes.

LID - 134
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions are well-established in the field of
      psychotherapy, and such interventions have also gained increased attention in the
      field of sport psychology, either to cope with psychological pressure or to
      improve an athlete's performance. The goal of the present study was to examine
      whether a Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) program could increase
      self-compassion and grit among elite female athletes compared to an active
      control condition. To this end, we performed a randomized trial among female
      adult athletes. METHODS: Forty female adult athletes (M(age) = 22.22, SD = 2.40)
      were randomly assigned either to the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment group (n =
      20; 7 group sessions, 60 min each) or the active control group (n = 20; 7 group
      sessions, 60 min each). At baseline, seven weeks later at the end of the study
      and again four weeks later at follow-up, participants completed a series of
      self-rating questionnaires on mindfulness, self-compassion and grit. RESULTS:
      Dimensions of mindfulness, self-compassion and grit improved over time, but more
      so in the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment condition compared to the active
      control condition. Improvements remained stable from the study end to follow-up.
      CONCLUSIONS: While the active control condition improved dimensions of
      mindfulness, self-compassion and grit among female adult athletes, improvements
      were much stronger in the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment condition.
      Importantly, improvements in the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment condition
      remained stable over a time lapse of four weeks at follow-up after study
      completion, suggesting that the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment intervention
      appeared to improve cognitive-emotional learning processes.

TI  - Mindful Climate Action: Health and Environmental Co-Benefits from
      Mindfulness-Based Behavioral Training.
LID - 1040 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/su8101040 [doi]
AB  - Greenhouse gases from human activities are causing climate change, creating risks
      for people around the globe. Behaviors involving transportation, diet, energy
      use, and purchasing drive greenhouse gas emissions, but are also related to
      health and well-being, providing opportunity for co-benefits. Replacing shorter
      automobile trips with walking or cycling, or eating plants rather than animals,
      for example, may increase personal health, while also reducing environmental
      impact. Mindfulness-based practices have been shown to enhance a variety of
      health outcomes, but have not been adapted towards environmental purposes. We
      designed the Mindful Climate Action (MCA) curriculum to help people improve their
      health while simultaneously lowering their carbon footprints. Combining
      mindfulness-based practices with the Stages of Change theory, the MCA program
      aims to: (1) improve personal health and well-being; (2) decrease energy use; (3)
      reduce automobile use; (4) increase active transport; (5) shift diet towards
      plant-based foods; and (6) reduce unnecessary purchasing. Mindfulness practices
      will foster attentional awareness, openness, and response flexibility, supporting
      positive behavior change. We plan to test MCA in a randomized controlled trial,
      with rigorous assessment of targeted outcomes. Our long-term goal is to refine
      and adapt the MCA program to a variety of audiences, in order to enhance public
      health and environmental sustainability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to investigate the possible interplay between
      self-compassion and affect during Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living (MBCL)
      in recurrently depressed individuals. METHODS: Data was used from a subsample of
      a parallel-group randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of MBCL
      in recurrently depressed adults (n = 104). Self-reports of self-compassion and
      positive/negative affect were obtained at the start of each of the eight MBCL
      sessions. RESULTS: Bivariate Autoregressive Latent Trajectory (ALT) modeling
      showed that, when looking at the interplay between self-compassion and
      positive/negative affect on a session-to-session basis, no significant reciprocal
      cross-lagged effects between self-compassion and positive affect were found.
      Although there were no cross-lagged effects from negative affect to
      self-compassion, higher levels of self-compassion at each session did predict
      lower levels of negative affect at the subsequent session
      (b(SC(t-1),NA(t)) = -0.182, s.e. = 0.076, p = .017). CONCLUSIONS: The current
      study shows that increases in self-compassion are followed by decreases in
      negative affect in MBCL for depression.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been demonstrated to be
      effective in adults with ADHD. The aim of the current study was to examine its
      possible working mechanisms. Method: In the context of an randomized controlled
      trial (RCT), MBCT + TAU (treatment as usual) (n = 43) versus TAU (n = 51), we
      used mediation analyses to examine whether reduction of clinician-rated ADHD
      symptoms and improvement of positive mental health at 6-month follow-up had been
      mediated by change in mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and executive
      functioning over the course of MBCT. Results: Increase of self-compassion
      mediated improvement of positive mental health at 6-month follow-up. Improvement
      of mindfulness skills or self-compassion did not mediate the reduction in ADHD
      symptoms. Additional analyses suggest that self-reported inhibition did.
      Conclusion: The effect of MBCT on ADHD symptoms and positive mental health thus
      occurred via different mechanisms of change, that is, by improvements in
      inhibition and self-compassion, respectively.

AB  - Self-compassion involves reflecting on shared human experiences, expressing
      self-kindness, and responding to feelings in a kind and non-judgmental way.
      Self-compassion interventions seem to be effective for women's body
      dissatisfaction, however, such interventions have not been trialed with men,
      including sexual minority men, who are particularly vulnerable. We conducted a
      randomized controlled trial of a brief self-compassion intervention designed to
      reduce body dissatisfaction among sexual minority men (N = 605). We used a 3
      (condition: self-compassion, self-esteem, and a benign recollection control) × 5
      (time) repeated measures design, whereby participants completed a brief writing
      task and completed body image measures at multiple time-points. Participants in
      both the self-compassion and self-esteem conditions showed improved body image
      and self-compassion following the intervention whereas participants in the
      control condition did not. Increases in self-compassion mediated body image
      measures for participants in the self-compassion but not self-esteem or control
      conditions. Participants in the self-compassion condition also showed increased
      self-compassion at three-weeks follow-up. While several caveats to our results
      were noted, our overall interpretation is that self-compassion and self-esteem
      interventions might be effective for sexual minority men's body image, and more
      research is necessary. The challenge of inculcating a self-compassionate mindset
      among men is also discussed.

TI  - Compassion Meditation for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Veterans: A Randomized
      Proof of Concept Study.
PG  - 299-309
LID - 10.1002/jts.22397 [doi]
AB  - There is considerable interest in developing complementary and integrative
      approaches for ameliorating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compassion
      meditation (CM) and loving-kindness meditation appear to offer benefits to
      individuals with PTSD, including symptom reduction. The present study was a pilot
      randomized controlled trial of CM for PTSD in veterans. The CM condition, an
      adaptation of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT®), consists of
      exercises to stabilize attention, develop present-moment awareness, and foster
      compassion. We compared CM to Veteran.calm (VC), which consists of
      psychoeducation about PTSD, rationale for relaxation, relaxation training, and
      sleep hygiene. Both conditions consist of 10 weekly 90-min group sessions with
      between-session practice assignments. A total of 28 veterans attended at least
      one session of the group intervention and completed pre- and posttreatment
      measures of PTSD severity and secondary outcomes as well as weekly measures of
      PTSD, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative emotions. Measures of
      treatment credibility, attendance, practice compliance, and satisfaction were
      administered to assess feasibility. A repeated measures analysis of variance
      revealed a more substantive reduction in PTSD symptoms in the CM condition than
      in the VC condition, between-group d = -0.85. Credibility, attendance, and
      satisfaction were similar across CM and VC conditions thus demonstrating the
      feasibility of CM and the appropriateness of VC as a comparison condition. The
      findings of this initial randomized pilot study provide rationale for future
      studies examining the efficacy and effectiveness of CM for veterans with PTSD.

TI  - Loving-Kindness Meditation vs Cognitive Processing Therapy for Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder Among Veterans: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e216604
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.6604 [doi]
LID - e216604
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Additional options are needed for treatment of posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) among veterans. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether group
      loving-kindness meditation is noninferior to group cognitive processing therapy
      for treatment of PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized
      clinical noninferiority trial assessed PTSD and depression at baseline,
      posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Veterans were recruited from
      September 24, 2014, to February 5, 2018, from a large Veternas Affairs medical
      center in Seattle, Washington. A total of 184 veteran volunteers who met
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria
      for PTSD were randomized. Data collection was completed November 28, 2018, and
      data analyses were conducted from December 10, 2018, to November 5, 2019.
      INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention comprised 12 weekly 90-minute group sessions.
      Loving-kindness meditation (n = 91) involves silent repetition of phrases
      intended to elicit feelings of kindness for oneself and others. Cognitive
      processing therapy (n = 93) combines cognitive restructuring with emotional
      processing of trauma-related content. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Co-primary
      outcomes were change in PTSD and depression scores over 6-month follow-up,
      assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; range, 0-80; higher is
      worse) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS;
      reported as standardized T-score with mean [SD] of 50 [10] points; higher is
      worse) depression measures. Noninferiority margins were 5 points on the CAPS-5
      and 4 points on the PROMIS depression measure. RESULTS: Among the 184 veterans
      (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [13.1] years; 153 men [83.2%]; 107 White participants
      [58.2%]) included in the study, 91 (49.5%) were randomized to the loving-kindness
      group, and 93 (50.5%) were randomized to the cognitive processing group. The mean
      (SD) baseline CAPS-5 score was 35.5 (11.8) and mean (SD) PROMIS depression score
      was 60.9 (7.9). A total of 121 veterans (66%) completed 6-month follow-up. At 6
      months posttreatment, mean CAPS-5 scores were 28.02 (95% CI, 24.72-31.32) for
      cognitive processing therapy and 25.92 (95% CI, 22.62-29.23) for loving-kindness
      meditation (difference, 2.09; 95% CI, -2.59 to 6.78), and mean PROMIS depression
      scores were 61.22 (95% CI, 59.21-63.23) for cognitive processing therapy and
      58.88 (95% CI, 56.86-60.91) for loving-kindness meditation (difference, 2.34; 95%
      CI, -0.52 to 5.19). In superiority analyses, there were no significant
      between-group differences in CAPS-5 scores, whereas for PROMIS depression scores,
      greater reductions were found for loving-kindness meditation vs cognitive
      processing therapy (for patients attending ≥6 visits, ≥4-point improvement was
      noted in 24 [39.3%] veterans receiving loving-kindness meditation vs 9 (18.0%)
      receiving cognitive processing therapy; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
      Among veterans with PTSD, loving-kindness meditation resulted in reductions in
      PTSD symptoms that were noninferior to group cognitive processing therapy. For
      both interventions, the magnitude of improvement in PTSD symptoms was modest.
      Change over time in depressive symptoms was greater for loving-kindness
      meditation than for cognitive processing therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT(®)) in Breast Cancer Survivors: A
      Randomized Clinical Trial Study.
PG  - 684-696
LID - 10.1177/1534735418772095 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Breast cancer (BC) requires a significant psychological adaptation once
      treatment is finished. There is growing evidence of how compassion training
      enhances psychological and physical well-being, however, there are very few
      studies analyzing the efficacy of compassion-based Interventions on BC survivors.
      OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of the Cognitively-Based Compassion Training
      (CBCT) protocol in a BC survivor sample on quality of life, psychological
      well-being, fear of cancer recurrence, self-compassion, and compassion domains
      and mindfulness facets. Furthermore, enrollment, adherence, and satisfaction with
      the intervention were also analyzed. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was
      designed. Participants (n = 56) were randomly assigned to CBCT (n = 28) or a
      treatment-as-usual control group (TAU; n = 28). Pre-post intervention and 6-month
      follow-up measures took place to evaluate health-related quality of life,
      psychological well-being; psychological stress, coping strategies, and triggering
      cognitions; self-compassion and compassion; and mindfulness in both intervention
      and wait-list groups. RESULTS: Accrual of eligible participants was high (77%),
      and the drop-out rate was 16%. Attendance to CBCT sessions was high and practice
      off sessions exceeded expectations). CBCT was effective in diminishing stress
      caused by FCR, fostering self-kindness and common humanity, and increasing
      overall self-compassion scores, mindful observation, and acting with awareness
      skillsets. CONCLUSION: CBCT could be considered a promising and potentially
      useful intervention to diminish stress caused by FCR and enhance self-kindness,
      common humanity, overall self-compassion, mindful observation, and acting with
      awareness skillsets. Nevertheless, future randomized trials are needed and a
      process of deeper cultural adaptation required.

TI  - Candidate mechanisms of action of mindfulness-based trauma recovery for refugees
      (MBTR-R): Self-compassion and self-criticism.
PG  - 107-122

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions may represent a
      promising intervention approach to the global mental health crisis of forced
      displacement. Specifically, Mindfulness-Based Trauma Recovery for Refugees
      (MBTR-R)-a mindfulness- and compassion-based, trauma-sensitive, and
      socioculturally adapted intervention for refugees and asylum-seekers-has recently
      demonstrated randomized control evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety. Yet,
      little is known about potential mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects
      for trauma recovery and for refugees and asylum-seekers. METHOD: Thus, we
      examined adaptive and maladaptive forms of self-referentiality, namely
      self-compassion and self-criticism, as mechanisms of action for trauma recovery
      in a randomized wait-list control trial of MBTR-R among a community sample of 158
      traumatized and chronically stressed asylum-seekers (46% female) in an urban
      postdisplacement setting (Middle East). Self-compassion and self-criticism were
      measured vis-à-vis an experimental Self-Referential Encoding Task (SRET) designed
      to quantify cognitive processes underlying self-compassion and self-criticism
      using diffusion modeling, a computational modeling approach to quantify cognitive
      processes underlying decision-making from behavioral reaction time data. RESULTS:
      Findings indicate that self-compassion and self-criticism were associated with
      trauma- and stress-related psychopathology at preintervention. Relative to
      wait-list controls, MBTR-R led to significant elevation in self-compassion, and
      reduction in self-criticism, from pre to postintervention. Finally, pre to
      postintervention change in self-criticism significantly mediated therapeutic
      effects of MBTR-R on depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      outcomes, while pre to postintervention change in self-compassion only mediated
      therapeutic effects on PTSD outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings speak to the
      importance of (mal)adaptive self-referentiality as a target mechanism in MBIs and
      trauma recovery broadly, and among refugees and asylum-seekers specifically.

TI  - Psychosocial interventions on the posttraumatic growth of adults with cancer: A
      systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.
PG  - 1798-1826
LID - 10.1002/pon.6241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been increasingly recognized that some people experience
      post-traumatic growth (PTG) as a result of struggling with cancer. OBJECTIVE:
      This systematic review aims to identify psychosocial interventions that might
      facilitate PTG in adults with cancer. METHODS: A search was conducted in
      PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ProQuest up to 16 September
      2022. The PRISMA guidelines were followed; all included interventional studies
      had to comprise 30 or more adults with cancer, using the Posttraumatic Growth
      Inventory, from 1994 forward. RESULTS: A total of 2731 articles were retrieved,
      1028 of those were screened and 37 unique trials were included (46 articles). A
      large number of studies were published since 2018 (52.4%), were randomized
      controlled trials (43.2%), and had group interventions (34.8%), including mainly
      female participants (83.8%) with a single cancer type (54.1%). Most interventions
      (75.7%) were moderately to highly effective in increasing PTG (d = 0.65, 95% CI
      0.39-0.91) with the most effective interventions using Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (d = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.05-2.44), Mindfulness-based (d = 0.54, 95%
      CI = 0.14-0.94) and Education, Peer Support and Health Coaching interventions
      (d = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.1-0.46). Expression-based and Positive Psychology-based
      approaches also showed promising results. Notably, the majority of studies had a
      high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: PTG facilitation is a promising field that should
      be pursued as it not only allows people with cancer to overcome their trauma but
      also results in them going over and above their pre-cancer state, enhancing
      resilience, health, and well-being.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for body
      dysmorphic disorder: Impact on core symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and
      executive functioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is
      garnering increasing empirical interest as an intervention for Body Dysmorphic
      Disorder (BDD), although no studies of mindfulness as a standalone treatment have
      included a sample composed entirely of patients with BDD or a comparison group.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement of MBCT intervention on
      the core symptoms, emotional dysfunction, and executive function of BDD patients,
      as well as the feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training. METHOD: Patients
      with BDD were randomized into an 8-week MBCT group (n = 58) or treatment-as-usual
      (TAU) control group (n = 58) and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment,
      and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants who received MBCT showed greater
      improvement on self-reported and clinician ratings of BDD symptoms, self-reported
      emotion dysregulation symptoms and executive function compared with TAU
      participants. Improvement for executive function tasks was partially supported.
      In addition, feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training were positive.
      LIMITATIONS: There is no systematic assessment of the severity of key potential
      outcome variables associated with BDD. CONCLUSION: MBCT may be a useful
      intervention for patients with BDD, improving patients' BDD symptoms, emotion
      dysregulation, and executive functioning.

TI  - Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Promoting Athletic Performance and
      Related Factors among Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph20032038 [doi]
LID - 2038
AB  - In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been widely applied
      in competition sports with respect to athletic performance and mental health
      promotion, whereas evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has not been
      well summarized. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and
      meta-analyze the existing evidence on the effects of MBIs on improving athletic
      performance, mindfulness level, mindfulness-related psychological components
      (e.g., acceptance, self-compassion, flow), and mental health (e.g., burnout,
      stress, psychological well-being) among athletes. Following the PRISMA
      guidelines, a literature search was implemented on five electronic databases (Web
      of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect) and relevant review
      papers. The article selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction were
      performed by two investigators independently. The standardized mean difference
      (SMD) was calculated to evaluate the effects of interventions using the random
      effect model. Among the 1897 original hits, thirty-two eligible RCT studies were
      included in the systematic review, of which seven were involved in the
      meta-analysis. The results showed that MBIs were effective in promoting athletes'
      athletic performances (by narrative synthesis), mindfulness-level (n = 3; SMD =
      0.50, 95% CI = [0.17, 0.83]; I(2) = 45%, p = 0.16), and mindfulness-related
      psychological components (n = 5; SMD = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.53, 1.10], I(2) = 77%, p
      =0.001), while no significant intervention effects were found on the mental
      health of athletes (n = 4; SMD = -0.03, 95% CI = [-0.35, 0.29], I(2) = 89%, p <
      0.001). Our findings preliminarily support the potential effectiveness of MBIs,
      whereas more high-quality RCTs were needed in the future.

TI  - Embodied Cognition in Meditation, Yoga, and Ethics-An Experimental Single-Case
      Study on the Differential Effects of Four Mind-Body Treatments.

LID - 11734
AB  - Yoga is an embodied contemplative practice considered as a path toward long-term
      well-being, which fosters an integrated processing of bodily and emotional
      stimuli. However, little is known about how the different components of yoga
      contribute to these processes. This was the aim of this single-case
      multiple-baseline study. Herein, we explored how different yoga components affect
      body awareness, emotion regulation, affectivity, self-compassion, and distress
      tolerance. Forty-two randomly assigned participants (from initially fifty-seven)
      completed one of four 8-week treatments: Mantra meditation alone (MA), meditation
      plus physical yoga (MY), meditation plus ethical education (ME), and meditation
      plus yoga and ethical education (MYE). Participants had no prior regular yoga or
      meditation practice. Data were analyzed using visual inspection, effect size
      estimation, and multilevel modeling. Surprisingly, all four treatments similarly
      improved body awareness (Tau-U(MA) = 0.21 to Tau-U(MY) = 0.49), emotion
      regulation (Tau-U(MYE) = -0.43 to Tau-U(ME) = -0.52), self-compassion (η(2) =
      0.08), and distress tolerance (η(2) = 0.13). These effects were maintained until
      follow-up at 2 and 12 months after the study, even though home practice declined.
      The MA condition had the least favorable effect on affective experience
      (Tau-U(MA) = -0.14 and 0.07), while the ME condition enhanced valence the most
      (Tau-U(ME) = 0.10) and the MY condition was the most effective in preventing
      negative affective responses. Although mantra meditation on its own negatively
      influenced daily affect, it can be assumed as the driving force behind the
      improvement in the other variables. This points to the central role of meditation
      in increasing interoception, self-awareness, and embodied processing.

TI  - Resilience, Insight, Self-Compassion, and Empowerment (RISE): A Randomized
      Controlled Trial of a Psychoeducational Group Program for Nurses.
PG  - 314-327
LID - 10.1177/10783903211033338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurses tend to be vulnerable to burnout and compassion fatigue due to
      constant workplace stressors. There is a need to provide advocacy, education,
      programming, and resources in the areas of positive coping and self-care to
      reduce burnout symptoms and promote well-being. RISE is an 8-week
      psychoeducational group intervention for nurses with four themes: resilience,
      insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. AIMS: This randomized controlled trial
      examined the effects of RISE on mental well-being. METHODS: The sample included
      75 registered nurses who work in a hospital-based setting. Outcomes included
      resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, stress mind-set, perceived
      stress, and burnout. Independent-samples t tests were conducted to compare
      outcomes between intervention and wait-list control groups at baseline and
      1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Supplemental analyses
      included paired-samples t tests and linear mixed models to compare the outcomes
      of the intervention group participants at baseline to 1-month follow-up, as well
      as at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention
      group showed improved levels of insight (i.e., engagement in self-reflection),
      perceived stress, and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) when compared with the
      control group and improved levels of resilience, self-compassion, stress
      mind-set, and perceived stress when compared with their baseline. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study informs how RISE affects nurse well-being and may be an effective
      intervention for reducing burnout and stress. This type of whole-person
      intervention can support nurses to improve their well-being and ability to cope
      amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational
      levels.

AB  - Digital mindfulness-based interventions (d-MBIs) have garnered significant
      research interest in recent years due to their psychological benefits. However,
      little is known about their impact on prosocial behaviors. This study
      investigates how d-MBIs impact prosocial behaviors where time spent is money,
      with Chinese adolescents as the subjects, through an online charity task
      (www.freerice.com). 119 students from a high school in China, who were
      inexperienced with mindfulness meditation, participated in this randomized
      controlled trial. The d-MBI group (N = 39) received online MBI guidance, while
      the face-to-face mindfulness-based intervention (f-MBI, N = 43) group underwent
      mindfulness intervention under personal tutors. The active control group (N = 37)
      completed a crossword task. Data analysis first involved repeated measures
      variance analysis, including pre-and post-intervention assessments. Subsequently,
      a two-way variance analysis was performed, with gender (female and male) and
      group (d-MBI, f-MBI, active control) as independent variables and the number of
      grains as dependent variables for the three groups of participants. Results
      showed that d-MBIs effectively improved empathy and compassion in Chinese
      adolescents, leading to increased rice donations to the United Nations World Food
      Program. These results underscore the positive effect of d-MBIs on prosociality
      and suggest their applicability in beneficial real-world situations involving
      prosocial behaviors, extending beyond previous research primarily conducted in
      artificial and hypothetical scenarios.

TI  - Exploring perceptions about Mindfulness and Mindful Eating Programs for
      low-income women with overweight in primary health care.
PG  - 319-329
LID - 10.1177/02601060221075537 [doi]
AB  - Background: Obesity and overweight are public health problems of multifactorial
      etiology, aggravated by the challenge that is maintaining weight loss. Used in
      the context of general health, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have also
      showed positive effects when targeting changes to overweight-related eating
      behaviors. Methods: This study consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled
      trial conducted with 284 women from primary health care units. Data were
      collected from the last session with 16 focus groups, considering each
      intervention group (mindfulness or mindful eating) Aim: This article aims to
      present the perceptions of low-income overweight women who participated in
      Mindfulness and Mindful Eating intervention groups in primary health care
      according to each type of intervention. Results: Seven themes were identified:
      course challenges; valorization of the teacher's attitudes; mindfulness
      understanding; self-awareness development; change of expectations; development of
      a different food-weight relationship; and discover of a wide range of benefits.
      Conclusion: Mindfulness and Mindful eating interventions affect not only an
      individual's relationship with body and food, but also life and human relations.
      The results indicate the feasibility of the intervention, which addresses a large
      number of patients who lack treatment options for overweight or emotional and
      psychological issues associated with this condition. MBIs such as mindful eating
      are applicable in primary health care facilities, targeting overweight women and
      supporting treatment by addressing a repressed demand in the system. Similar to
      mind-body therapies, these interventions allow for comprehensive
      care.ClinicalTrials.gov, (NCT02893150) on 30 March 2017.

LID - 10.1080/10615806.2021.1949000 [doi]
AB  - There is a limited research on the effects of self-care, specifically the
      importance of taking time to reflect on one's self-care habits. Healthy
      undergraduate students (N = 95) were assigned to either a self-care intervention
      or passive control condition. The intervention group (N = 52) was prompted daily
      via email with questions about self-care habits and plans over three weeks,
      whereas the control group (N = 43) only completed baseline and post-assessments.
      Primary outcome variables included subjective happiness, positive and negative
      affect, and stress. Explanatory variables included mindfulness, self-compassion,
      and active coping tendency. Stress and negative affect decreased in the
      intervention group relative to the control group, but no interaction was observed
      for happiness and positive affect. There was no evidence that these effects were
      moderated by participant mindfulness, coping tendency, or self-compassion. These
      results suggest that even a very brief daily reflection on self-care can have
      powerful effects in promoting resilience against the accumulation of negative
      affect and stress over the term.

      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 186-206
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12224 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to conduct the first randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a second-generation
      mindfulness-based intervention (SG-MBI) for treating fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).
      Compared to first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, SG-MBIs are more
      acknowledging of the spiritual aspect of mindfulness. DESIGN: A RCT employing
      intent-to-treat analysis. METHODS: Adults with FMS received an 8-week SG-MBI
      known as meditation awareness training (MAT; n = 74) or an active control
      intervention known as cognitive behaviour theory for groups (n = 74). Assessments
      were performed at pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up phases. RESULTS: Meditation
      awareness training participants demonstrated significant and sustained
      improvements over control group participants in FMS symptomatology, pain
      perception, sleep quality, psychological distress, non-attachment (to self,
      symptoms, and environment), and civic engagement. A mediation analysis found that
      (1) civic engagement partially mediated treatment effects for all outcome
      variables, (2) non-attachment partially mediated treatment effects for
      psychological distress and sleep quality, and (3) non-attachment almost fully
      mediated treatment effects for FMS symptomatology and pain perception. Average
      daily time spent in meditation was found to be a significant predictor of changes
      in all outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Meditation awareness training may be a
      suitable treatment for adults with FMS and appears to ameliorate FMS
      symptomatology and pain perception by reducing attachment to self. Statement of
      contribution What is already known on this subject? Designing interventions to
      treat fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) continues to be a challenge. There is growing
      interest into the applications of mindfulness-based interventions for treating
      FMS. Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) are a key new
      direction in mindfulness research. What does this study add? Meditation awareness
      training - an SG-MBI - resulted in significant reductions in FMS symptomatology.
      SG-MBIs recognize the spiritual aspect of mindfulness and may have a role in the
      treatment of FMS.

      neurorehabilitation to address psychological distress. Animal-assistance is
      thought to increase efficacy. The present study evaluates a psychotherapeutic
      mindfulness- and self-compassion-based group intervention (MSCBI) with and
      without animal-assistance for patients with acquired brain injury. Patients
      (N = 31) were randomly assigned to the 6-week intervention with (n = 14) or
      without animal-assistance (n = 17). Primary outcome was psychological distress at
      post- and follow-up treatment, secondary outcomes were changes within-session of
      patients' emotional states, adherence to treatment and attrition. Psychological
      distress significantly decreased in both groups from pre- to follow-up treatment
      with no difference between groups. Patients in the animal-assisted MSCBI group
      reported significantly higher increases in feeling secure, accepted, comforted,
      grateful, motivated and at ease during the sessions compared to patients in the
      MSCBI group without animal-assistance. Adherence to sessions was significantly
      higher in the animal-assisted MSCBI group. Attrition did not significantly differ
      between groups. Our results show that both MSCBIs with and without
      animal-assistance are feasible and effective in reducing psychological distress
      in patients with acquired brain injury. The significant changes within-sessions
      mainly in relationship-based emotional states and the higher treatment adherence
      suggest additional effects of animal-assistance. Animal-assistance might increase
      acceptability and patients' commitment to psychotherapy.

AB  - Combinations of multiple meditation practices have been shown to reduce the
      attrition of telomeres, the protective caps of chromosomes (Carlson et al.,
      2015). Here, we probed the distinct effects on telomere length (TL) of
      mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Midlife adults
      (N = 142) were randomized to be in a waitlist control condition or to learn
      either MM or LKM in a 6-week workshop. Telomere length was assessed 2 weeks
      before the start of the workshops and 3 weeks after their termination. After
      controlling for appropriate demographic covariates and baseline TL, we found TL
      decreased significantly in the MM group and the control group, but not in the LKM
      group. There was also significantly less TL attrition in the LKM group than the
      control group. The MM group showed changes in TL that were intermediate between
      the LKM and control groups yet not significantly different from either.
      Self-reported emotions and practice intensity (duration and frequency) did not
      mediate these observed group differences. This study is the first to disentangle
      the effects of LKM and MM on TL and suggests that LKM may buffer telomere
      attrition.

TI  - Boosting Psychological Well-Being through a Social Mindfulness-Based Intervention
      in the General Population.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17228404 [doi]
LID - 8404
AB  - The benefits of mindfulness meditation among clinical and non-clinical
      populations have been largely reported in literature. Existing mindfulness-based
      programs are particularly useful in targeting specific populations while
      researchers have pointed out the possibility of developing programs adapted to
      the audience and the context. In this two-groups pre-post experimental design we
      developed a mindfulness-based social intervention program to target individuals
      from the general population. Here we present a two-groups pre-post experimental
      design to investigate its effectiveness on participants' psychological
      functioning assessed by eight self-reported questionnaires (CORE-OM, FFMQ, SWLS,
      PANAS, PSS, SCS, WEMWBS, SHS) which encompass different domains of well-being,
      mindfulness and emotional functioning. Participants, recruited on voluntary
      basis, were randomly allocated to treated or passive control groups and were
      aware of group allocation. The intervention comprises a 12-week meditation
      training in a big group that represents the social aspect of meditation. Data
      were analysed via a linear mixed effect model and intention to treat.
      Statistically significant results were obtained for global score of CORE-OM (β =
      -0.20 [-0.30; -0.10], p = 0.0002), FFMQ (β = 0.20 [0.12; -0.28], p < 0.0001),
      SWLS (β = 1.43 [0.42; 2.45], p = 0.006), positive PANAS (β = 1.99 [0.95; 3.04], p
      = 0.0002), negative PANAS (β = -1.67 [-2.92; -0.43], p = 0.009), PSS (β = -2.98
      [-4.25; -1.71], p < 0.0001), WEMWBS (β = 4.38 [2.93; 5.83], p < 0.0001) and SHS
      (β = 1.43 [0.42; 2.45], p = 0.006). Our intervention is causally associated with
      an improvement of the psychological functioning and hence can be considered as a
      preventive measure that may potentially reduce the risk of developing
      psychological problems and improve the subject's general well-being. Given the
      voluntary recruitment, our inference only applies to those individuals who have
      decided to experience meditation as a way to well-being and not to a random
      person from the general population.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Smoking Cessation Enhanced With Mobile Technology (iQuit
      Mindfully): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e13059
LID - 10.2196/13059 [doi]
LID - e13059
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training shows promise for improving smoking cessation
      and lapse recovery, and between-session mobile health messages could enhance
      treatment engagement and effectiveness. Personalized, in-the-moment text
      messaging support could be particularly useful for low-income smokers with fewer
      smoking cessation resources. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the feasibility
      of a text messaging program (iQuit Mindfully) as an adjunct to in-person
      Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment (MBAT) for smoking cessation. METHODS: A
      total of 71 participants were randomly assigned to MBAT (n=33) or iQuit Mindfully
      (n=38; MBAT + between-session text messages); of these, 70% (50/71) were African
      American, and 61% (43/71) had an annual household income of US $30,000 or less.
      All participants received 8 weekly therapist-led group counseling sessions,
      nicotine patches, and self-help materials. Outcomes were feasibility (attrition,
      engagement, and participants' ratings), participants' feedback regarding the text
      messaging intervention, and smoking cessation (assessed in person). RESULTS:
      Strong retention was achieved (76% [54/71] at the end of treatment, and 89%
      [63/71] at 1-month follow-up). In the iQuit Mindfully group, engagement was high
      (88% [29/33] indicated reading all or most texts, and 89% [34/38] engaged in
      interactive texting), and participants provided positive ratings (on a 1-10
      scale, average rating for recommending the program to others was 8.4 [SD 2.5]).
      Participants indicated benefiting from the texts (eg, appreciating encouraging
      reminders, coping strategies, and social support) and suggested improvements (eg,
      more personalization). Overall, biochemically confirmed smoking cessation rates
      were 22% (12/55) at the end of treatment and 19% (12/62) at 1-month follow-up,
      with no differences between conditions. Living below the poverty level predicted
      worse cessation outcomes at 1-month follow-up among participants receiving
      in-person only treatment (P=.03) but not among those receiving iQuit Mindfully.
      CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging appears to be a feasible and acceptable modality for
      supporting mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. The availability of
      24/7 text messaging might be particularly helpful for low-income smokers who have
      access to fewer cessation resources and experience significant day-to-day
      barriers to quitting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03029819;

AB  - The opioid misuse epidemic has reached a crisis level in the United States.
      Though mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) has been shown as effective in
      treating substance use disorders, there is limited research on its application to
      opioid use disorders specifically, and there is a need to understand the
      underlying mechanisms. This paper outlines a protocol for a randomized controlled
      trial of MBRP for opioid use disorders. MBRP is a group aftercare program that
      integrates mindfulness skills training with cognitive-behavioral relapse
      prevention strategies. We will recruit 240 participants who have completed opioid
      use disorder treatment, and randomize them to an 8-week MBRP group intervention
      or treatment as usual (TAU) control group. The TAU control group will complete
      the intervention after 8 weeks. Assessments will take place at baseline, 8 weeks,
      and 16 weeks. The primary outcome is frequency of opioid use. The secondary
      outcomes include craving and withdrawal symptoms, time to first opioid use,
      adherence to medication-assisted treatment plans, perceived stress, quality of
      life, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and chronic pain. We will also examine the
      following potential moderators and correlates of intervention outcomes: comorbid
      diagnoses, life events history, and MBRP intervention adherence. In addition, we
      will examine the following mediators of intervention outcome: mindfulness skills,
      emotion regulation skills, executive functioning skills, savoring, and positive
      and negative affect. This study will contribute to the evidence base regarding
      MBRP's efficacy in reducing opioid use, as well as contribute to the
      understanding of the causal mechanisms and factors that modify treatment outcome
      for MBRP for substance use disorders.

TI  - The effects of self-compassion components on shame-proneness in individuals with
      depression: An exploratory study.
PG  - 1103-1110
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2560 [doi]
AB  - To date, there is no evidence regarding how self-compassion's components,
      self-kindness, common humanity and mindfulness could work as distinct
      interventions. Thus, the main objective of the present study was exploring the
      effects that the three separate components of self-compassion would have on
      shame-proneness levels in individuals with clinical depression. All the
      participants (n = 122) with a diagnostic of Major Depressive Disorder were
      randomized in four experimental groups: the self-kindness exercises group, the
      mindfulness exercises group, the common humanity one and the control group.
      Results indicated that levels of depression and shame-proneness, as measured by
      BDI-II, TOSCA-3 and ESS decreased from baseline to post-intervention, but no
      significant differences were observed between groups. Therefore, we cannot
      conclude that one self-compassion component is more efficient than the others,
      but the present study does offer, though, a strong starting point for more
      complex, future studies.

TI  - Mindfulness-based mobile app reduces anxiety and increases self-compassion in
      healthcare students: A randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 686-693
LID - 10.1080/0142159X.2021.1887835 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of a mindfulness-based mobile application versus
      an in-person mindfulness-based training program in terms of reducing anxiety and
      increasing empathy, self-compassion, and mindfulness in a population of
      healthcare students. METHODS: The authors conducted a single-blind, randomised
      controlled trial with three parallel groups. Participants were allocated to the
      mobile app, the in-person mindfulness-based program (IMBP), or a control group.
      Assessments at baseline and postintervention (8 weeks) included measures of
      anxiety, empathy, self-compassion, and mindfulness. RESULTS: Of 168 students
      randomised, 84 were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (app: n = 31; IMBP:
      n = 23; control: n = 30). The mobile app group showed a large effect size for
      reductions in trait anxiety compared with controls (g = 0.85, p = 0.003), and a
      medium, nonsignificant effect compared with the IMBP group (g = 0.52, p = 0.152).
      Participants from both interventions experienced a significant increase in
      self-compassion and mindfulness compared with controls. Levels of empathy
      remained unchanged for the 3 arms. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile app can be as effective
      as an IMBP in reducing anxiety and increasing self-compassion and mindfulness
      among healthcare students.

TI  - Contributors to and consequences of burnout among clinical genetic counselors in
      the United States.
PG  - 269-278
LID - 10.1002/jgc4.1485 [doi]
AB  - Prior research has found that many genetic counselors (GCs) experience burnout.
      Studies of other clinicians have demonstrated that burnout can have significant
      detrimental consequences for clinicians, patients, and the healthcare system. We
      sought to explore the prevalence of, contributors to, and consequences of burnout
      among GCs. We performed a secondary data analysis of baseline data from Me-GC, a
      randomized controlled trial of meditation for GCs. We applied a systems model of
      burnout proposed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), which depicts burnout
      arising from a combination of contributors that include both work system and
      individual mediating factors, and then leading to consequences. Validated
      self-report scales were used to measure burnout and most contributors and
      consequences. Female and white GCs were over-represented in our sample. Over half
      (57.2%) of the 397 participants had Professional Fulfillment Index scores
      indicative of burnout. Multiple potential contributors were associated with
      burnout, consistent with its known multifactorial nature. Among work system
      factors, higher levels of burnout were associated with insufficient
      administrative support, lack of autonomy, and not feeling valued by non-GC
      colleagues. Individual mediating factors associated with greater burnout included
      higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Participants with lower levels
      of burnout reported greater mindfulness, resilience, and use of professional
      self-care behaviors. Among variables categorized as consequences, higher levels
      of burnout were associated with lower levels of empathy, counseling alliance, and
      positive unconditional regard, as well as higher reactive distress, and a greater
      desire to reduce the amount of time spent on clinical care. Given the prevalence
      and potential consequences of burnout observed here, it is imperative that the
      field take steps to mitigate burnout risk.

AB  - Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) impacts recipients' quality of life
      (QoL). Few mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in HCT recipients have shown
      feasibility, but heterogeneous practices and outcome measures have called into
      question the actual benefit. We hypothesized that self-guided isha kriya, a
      12-minute guided meditation based on the principles of yoga focusing on
      breathing, awareness, and thought, as a mobile app would improve QoL in the acute
      HCT setting. This single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial was
      conducted in 2021 to 2022. Autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients age ≥18 years
      were included. The study was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee and
      registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India, and all participants provided
      written informed consent. HCT recipients without access to smartphones or regular
      practitioners of yoga, meditation, or other mind-body practices were excluded.
      Participants were randomized to the control arm or the isha kriya arm at a 1:1
      ratio stratified by type of transplantation. Patients in the isha kriya arm were
      instructed to perform the kriya twice daily from pre-HCT to day +30 post-HCT. The
      primary endpoint was QoL summary scores as assessed by the Functional Assessment
      of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) and the Patient-Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS-GH) questionnaires.
      The secondary endpoints were the differences in QoL domain scores. The validated
      questionnaires were self-administered before the intervention and at days +30 and
      +100 post-HCT. The analysis of endpoints was done on an intention-to-treat basis.
      Domain and summary scores were calculated for each instrument as recommended by
      the developers. A P value < .05 was considered to indicate statistical
      significance, and Cohen's d effect size was used to determine clinical
      significance. A total of 72 HCT recipients were randomized to the isha kriya and
      control arms. Patients in the 2 arms were matched for age, sex, diagnosis, and
      type of HCT. The 2 arms showed no differences in pre-HCT QoL domain, summary, and
      global scores. At day +30 post-HCT, there was no difference between the arms in
      the mean FACT-BMT total score (112.9 ± 16.8 for the isha kriya arm versus 101.2 ±
      13.9 for the control arm; P = .2) or the mean global health score (global mental
      health, 45.1 ± 8.6 versus 42.5 ± 7.2 [P = .5]; global physical health, 44.1 ± 6.3
      versus 44.1 ± 8.3 [P = .4]) in the 2 groups. Similarly, there were no differences
      in physical, social, emotional, and functional domain scores. However, the mean
      bone marrow transplantation (BMT) subscale scores, which addresses BMT-specific
      QoL concerns, were statistically and clinically significantly higher in the isha
      kriya arm (27.9 ± 5.1 versus 24.4 ± 9.2; P = .03; Cohen's d = .5; medium effect
      size). This effect was transient; mean day +100 scores showed no difference (28.3
      ± 5.9 versus 26.2 ± 9.4; P = .3). Our data indicate that the isha kriya
      intervention did not improve the FACT-BMT total and global health scores in the
      acute HCT setting. However, practicing isha kriya for 1 month was associated with
      transient improvement in the FACT-BMT subscale scores on day +30 but not on day
      +100 post-HCT.

      frequency when total amount of meditation is held constant.

AB  - Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps. However, the
      optimal dosing of app-delivered meditation practice has not been established. We
      examined whether the distribution of meditation practices across a day impacted
      outcomes in a distressed population. We investigated the effects of meditation
      practice frequency in a 2-week compassion-based meditation intervention delivered
      via the Healthy Minds Program app. Undergraduates with clinically elevated
      depression and/or anxiety (N = 351) were randomized to a massed (one 20-min
      meditation per day) or distributed condition (two 10-min meditations per day).
      Psychological distress (primary outcome; composite of depression and anxiety),
      experiential avoidance, fear of missing out, loneliness, and self-compassion were
      assessed pre- and post-intervention. Psychological distress, loneliness, and
      informal meditation practice were also assessed daily. Practice time and
      frequency were assessed using app data. Results support feasibility of the study
      design, success of the manipulation, and acceptability of the intervention.
      Pooled across conditions, participants exhibited pre-post improvements on all
      outcomes (absolute value of ds = 0.12-0.63, p ≤ .010) and trajectories of
      improvement on daily distress and loneliness (p ≤ .010). No between-group
      differences were observed on changes in pre-post or daily measures (ps =
      .158-.729). When total amount of meditation practice per day is held constant,
      the distribution of practice may not influence outcomes for distressed beginners.
      Although only a first test of dose frequency effects, findings support
      flexibility in the distribution of meditation throughout the day, which may
      increase accessibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights

AB  - Objective: Due to a rise in perfectionistic tendencies and growing concerns about
      the increase in mental health conditions among students this study aimed to
      examine the effects of a brief intervention in self-compassion on maladaptive
      perfectionism, anxiety, depression, and body image. Methods: The intervention
      consisted of four seminars and a silent half-day retreat with short lectures and
      relevant experiential practices from Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) and
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). This randomized wait-list control
      trial was pre-registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT03453437, Unique Protocol
      ID: UiBMSC2018). University students were randomly assigned to the intervention
      group and wait-list control group and filled out surveys weekly. A repeated
      measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the groups pre- and
      post-treatment. Mixed level modeling was used to analyze changes in all outcome
      measures over time. Results: Eighty-nine participants completed the intervention.
      Results of the ANOVA showed significant post-intervention reductions in
      maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies and symptoms of depression and anxiety, in
      addition to increased self-compassion and improved body image in the intervention
      group as compared to the wait-list group. Mixed level modeling showed
      statistically significant changes in self-compassion, maladaptive perfectionism,
      adaptive perfectionism, anxiety, and depression but not body image. Only the
      mixed level modeling showed small but significant changes to adaptive
      perfectionism, also called strivings. Implications of different changes to
      maladaptive perfectionism than adaptive perfectionism are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of an online self-compassionate writing
      intervention on stigmatizing and affirming self-views toward the body in a sample
      of college women (N = 254). Participants were randomly assigned to a
      self-compassionate writing, attentional-control writing, or wait-list control
      condition for one week, and completed measures of self-compassion, affirming
      self-perceptions, and stigmatizing self-perceptions at baseline, one-week post
      intervention, and one-month post intervention. A series of mixed AN(C)OVAs
      revealed no significant effects by condition or time on stigmatizing or affirming
      self-views toward the body when controlling for self-esteem, internalized weight
      stigma, and eating disorder symptomatology. Follow-up exploratory analyses
      demonstrated no significant effects by condition on the six facets of
      self-compassion. Notably, participants were significantly more likely to drop out
      from the study over time if they were lower in self-compassion and self-esteem,
      and higher in internalized weight stigma at baseline. These results suggest that
      online self-compassion writing interventions may need to be longer and more
      potent, especially for women with more entrenched and stigmatized views about
      their bodies, as well as potential boundary conditions of cultivating
      self-compassion in a short-term online intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence for the longer-term benefits of online mindfulness training
      for medical students, including in the reduction of stress and improved
      wellbeing, is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a novel online
      mindfulness training program on trait mindfulness, wellbeing and study engagement
      of medical students at program completion and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: This
      was a randomised waitlist control study of an 8-week, online, mindfulness-based
      intervention versus normal curriculum alone for medical students (N = 114). The
      primary outcome measures were the changes from baseline to program completion at
      Week 8 for self-reported trait mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory),
      perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), self-compassion (Self-Compassion
      Scale) and study engagement scores (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students).
      The secondary outcome measures were these score changes from baseline to 6-month
      follow up. Intervention and control students completed surveys at all three time
      points. Program adherence (Mindfulness Adherence Questionnaire) was also measured
      in the intervention group. RESULTS: The intervention group experienced modest but
      statistically significant improvements in mindfulness (9%, p = 0.0002),
      self-compassion (5%, p = 0.026), and study engagement (4%, p = 0.035) from
      baseline to Week 8. They also reported a sustained improvement of 5% (p = 0.017)
      in mindfulness scores at 6 months. The control group reported no significant
      changes at Week 8 or 6 Months. Between-group comparisons showed that compared to
      the control group, the intervention group improved significantly more in
      mindfulness (p = 0.0076), and statistically marginally more in study engagement
      (p = 0.0534) at Week 8. No statistically significant between-group differences
      were observed at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the small but
      growing body of evidence suggesting that online mindfulness-based interventions
      with minimal contact can improve, albeit in modest magnitude, mindfulness and
      possibly study engagement in medical students for the duration of a mindfulness
      program. Further refinements to the program may be important to maintain
      improvements in the longer-term. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number

TI  - The effectiveness of positive psychological interventions for patients with
      cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 3752-3774
LID - 10.1111/jocn.17358 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of positive psychological
      interventions on quality of life, positive psychological outcomes and negative
      psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer
      often suffer from various psychological problems and have a poor quality of life.
      Positive psychological interventions have been increasingly applied to patients
      with cancer, but the results of these studies have not been synthesized. DESIGN:
      A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials according
      to PRISMA. METHODS: Six English databases and four Chinese databases were
      searched from the inception to December 2022. Two reviewers independently
      assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RevMan was used
      for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials examined the
      effects of positive psychological interventions including meaning therapy,
      dignity therapy, positive psychotherapy, mindfulness- based intervention, life
      review, expressive writing intervention, acceptance and commitment psychotherapy,
      attention and interpretation therapy, compassion training and spiritual therapy
      on patients with cancer. Positive psychological interventions significantly
      improved the quality of life, enhanced positive psychological outcomes including
      well-being, meaning of life, self-esteem, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy
      and alleviated negative psychological outcomes including depression, anxiety and
      hopelessness. However, the heterogeneity of some outcomes was rather high, due to
      the wide diversity of the interventions included. CONCLUSION: Positive
      psychological interventions have potentially positive effects on improving
      quality of life, enhancing positive psychological outcomes and alleviating
      negative psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. However, due to the
      heterogeneity and the lack of follow-up studies, more high-quality studies are
      needed to confirm the results of our review and to clarify the long-term effects
      of positive psychological interventions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As
      feasible psychological interventions, healthcare professionals can consider
      applying appropriate positive psychological interventions according to the
      condition of cancer patients. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or
      public contribution.

TI  - Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) reduces depression-related
      self-referential processing in patients with bipolar disorder: an exploratory
      task-based study.
PG  - 1255-1272
LID - 10.1080/02699931.2022.2105308 [doi]
AB  - Negative self-referential processing has fruitfully been studied in unipolar
      depressed patients, but remarkably less in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).
      This exploratory study examines the relation between task-based self-referential
      processing and depressive symptoms in BD and their possible importance to the
      working mechanism of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for BD. The study
      population consisted of a subsample of patients with BD (n = 49) participating in
      an RCT of MBCT for BD, who were assigned to MBCT + TAU (n = 23) or treatment as
      usual (TAU) (n = 26). Patients performed the self-referential encoding task
      (SRET), which measures (1) positive and (2) negative attributions to oneself as
      well as (3) negative self-referential memory bias, before and after MBCT + TAU or
      TAU. At baseline, all three SRET measures were significantly related to
      depressive symptoms in patients with BD. Moreover, repeated measures analyses of
      variance revealed that negative self-referential memory bias diminished over time
      in the MBCT + TAU group, compared with the TAU group. Given the preliminary
      nature of our findings, future research should explore the possibly mediating
      role of reducing negative self-referential memory bias in preventing and treating
      depressive symptoms in BD through MBCT.

TI  - The Effects of Zentangle® on Affective Well-Being Among Adults: A Pilot
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 7605205060 [pii]
LID - 10.5014/ajot.2022.049113 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Zentangle® is a self-help art modality purported to have repetitive,
      mindful, and meditative qualities. It can be a cost-effective intervention, but
      its effect on affective well-being has been underresearched. OBJECTIVE: To
      evaluate the immediate and 2-wk postintervention effects of Zentangle delivered
      by a certified Zentangle teacher on affective well-being in the general
      population. DESIGN: Two-armed parallel-groups pilot randomized controlled trial.
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight participants from a nonclinical population.
      INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized into the Zentangle group, which
      participated in a 2-hr Zentangle class and were encouraged to practice for 2 wk,
      or the waitlist control group. Participants learned basic Zentangle principles
      and drew two Zentangles under the teacher's instructions. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
      The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress
      Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form were used to assess positive and
      negative affect; depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; and self-compassion.
      RESULTS: Significant reductions in negative affect were found in the Zentangle
      group compared with the waitlist control group at both immediate and 2-wk
      postintervention assessments (ds = 1.04 and 0.79, respectively, p < .001).
      Participants who practiced Zentangle for >80 min per week had a significant
      reduction in anxiety symptoms and an improvement in self-compassion (ds = 0.84
      and 0.24, ps < .05 and .005, respectively). No significant between-groups
      difference was found for other measures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results
      shed light on the effects of Zentangle on improving affective well-being in the
      general population. With sufficient practice, Zentangle can also help improve
      self-compassion and reduce anxiety. What This Article Adds: The results of this
      study could provide information to determine whether Zentangle can be used as a
      tool in occupational therapy intervention to improve affective well-being.

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction for family carers of people with dementia.
PG  - CD012791
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012791.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012791
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caring for people with dementia is highly challenging, and family
      carers are recognised as being at increased risk of physical and mental
      ill-health. Most current interventions have limited success in reducing stress
      among carers of people with dementia. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
      draws on a range of practices and may be a promising approach to helping carers
      of people with dementia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of MBSR in
      reducing the stress of family carers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We
      searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's
      Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 9 of 12, 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1950 to September
      2017), Embase (Ovid SP 1974 to Sepetmber 2017), Web of Science (ISI Web of
      Science 1945 to September 2017), PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to September 2017),
      CINAHL (all dates to September 2017), LILACS (all dates to September 2017), World
      Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
      (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to
      6 September 2017, with no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) of MBSR for family carers of people with dementia. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened references for
      inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of trials with the
      Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the
      GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information, then
      conducted meta-analyses, or reported results narratively in the case of
      insufficient data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by
      Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs involving 201 carers assessing the
      effectiveness of MBSR. Controls used in included studies varied in structure and
      content. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes were compared with either
      active controls (those matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. education,
      social support, or progressive muscle relaxation), or inactive controls (those
      not matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. self help education or respite
      care). One trial used both active and inactive comparisons with MBSR. All studies
      were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessment. Most
      studies provided no information about selective reporting, incomplete outcome
      data, or allocation concealment.1. Compared with active controls, MBSR may reduce
      depressive symptoms of carers at the end of the intervention (3 trials, 135
      participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.63, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) -0.98 to -0.28; P<0.001; low-quality evidence). We could not be certain of
      any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low-quality
      evidence).Mindfulness-based stress reduction compared with active control may
      decrease carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 78 participants;
      mean difference (MD) -7.50, 95% CI -13.11 to -1.89; P<0.001; low-quality
      evidence) and may slightly increase carer burden (3 trials, 135 participants; SMD
      0.24, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.58; P=0.18; low-quality evidence), although both results
      were imprecise, and we could not exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low
      quality of the evidence, we could not be sure of any effect on carers' coping
      style, nor could we determine whether carers were more or less likely to drop out
      of treatment.2. Compared with inactive controls, MBSR showed no clear evidence of
      any effect on depressive symptoms (2 trials, 50 participants; MD -1.97, 95% CI
      -6.89 to 2.95; P=0.43; low-quality evidence). We could not be certain of any
      effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low-quality
      evidence).In this comparison, MBSR may also reduce carer anxiety at the end of
      the intervention (1 trial, 33 participants; MD -7.27, 95% CI -14.92 to 0.38;
      P=0.06; low-quality evidence), although we were unable to exclude little or no
      effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be certain of
      any effects of MBSR on carer burden, the use of positive coping strategies, or
      dropout rates.We found no studies that looked at quality of life of carers or
      care-recipients, or institutionalisation.Only one included study reported on
      adverse events, noting a single adverse event related to yoga practices at home
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for non-specific effects of the
      intervention (i.e. comparing it with an active control), low-quality evidence
      suggests that MBSR may reduce carers' depressive symptoms and anxiety, at least
      in the short term.There are significant limitations to the evidence base on MBSR
      in this population. Our GRADE assessment of the evidence was low to very low
      quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily because of high risk
      of detection or performance bias, and imprecision.In conclusion, MBSR has the
      potential to meet some important needs of the carer, but more high-quality
      studies in this field are needed to confirm its efficacy.

      intervention, either in the intervention group (n=11) or in a waitlist control
      group (n=8). The intervention was adapted from the standardized eight-session
      'Making Friends with Yourself' programme, and sessions were delivered 1 week
      apart. Acceptability was assessed through qualitative questionnaires and
      feasibility was assessed based on session attendance and recruitment metrics.
      Possible changes to disordered eating behaviour, self-care behaviours,
      diabetes-related distress, self-compassion, stress and glycaemic control were
      also assessed. RESULTS: Nineteen participants completed the study, and they
      reported an increased sense of common humanity (acknowledging that we are not
      alone), mindfulness, and coping resources. In terms of feasibility, recruitment
      took longer than expected (8 months) and not all participants were able to attend
      both sessions (nine could only attend one of the two sessions). CONCLUSIONS:
      While self-compassion is a strong conceptual fit for the issues of type 1
      diabetes and disordered eating behaviour in adolescence, and the intervention
      content appears acceptable, feasibility issues were such that brief
      self-compassion programmes will probably need to be adapted into digital
      interventions for future research. (Trial registration number: ANZCTR

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of mindfulness and mindfulness
      training as a way to decrease stress and increase psychological functioning.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects and
      experiences of mindfulness stress-reduction training as described by patients
      with cancer participating in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction training
      program. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: The study is based on analysis of data collected
      in semistructured interviews of the participants (n = 18) after the completion of
      a mindfulness-meditation training program. The intervention consisted of an
      8-week mindfulness-training course. RESULTS: Most participants expressed a number
      of perceived positive effects of participating in the mindfulness program
      including increased calm, enhanced sleep quality, more energy, less physical
      pain, and increased well-being. However, a few participants experienced no
      effect. Both negative and positive views of the specific meditation and yoga
      exercises included in the program were expressed. Components that were described
      as of particular importance, regarding the experience of participating in the
      program, were the nonjudgmental and accepting approach guiding the program and
      the instructors, the influence of the group process and sharing experiences with
      patients with similar experiences, and the emphasis on increased awareness of the
      present moment. CONCLUSION: This study gives support for the use of mindfulness
      programs in reducing stress-related complaints among some patients with a cancer
      diagnosis. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The positive experiences of mindfulness
      training reported by patients with cancer call for further studies examining the
      possibilities and requirements for implementation of mindfulness programs in
      clinical practice.

TI  - Compassion meditation enhances empathic accuracy and related neural activity.
PG  - 48-55

AB  - The ability to accurately infer others' mental states from facial expressions is
      important for optimal social functioning and is fundamentally impaired in social
      cognitive disorders such as autism. While pharmacologic interventions have shown
      promise for enhancing empathic accuracy, little is known about the effects of
      behavioral interventions on empathic accuracy and related brain activity. This
      study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to investigate
      the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation program,
      cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic accuracy. Twenty-one
      healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic
      accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and
      after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon
      completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were
      significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the
      RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
      dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, changes in dmPFC and IFG
      activity from baseline to the post-intervention assessment were associated with
      changes in empathic accuracy. These findings suggest that CBCT may hold promise
      as a behavioral intervention for enhancing empathic accuracy and the neurobiology
      supporting it.

TI  - Compassion training alters altruism and neural responses to suffering.
PG  - 1171-80
LID - 10.1177/0956797612469537 [doi]
AB  - Compassion is a key motivator of altruistic behavior, but little is known about
      individuals' capacity to cultivate compassion through training. We examined
      whether compassion may be systematically trained by testing whether (a)
      short-term compassion training increases altruistic behavior and (b) individual
      differences in altruism are associated with training-induced changes in neural
      responses to suffering. In healthy adults, we found that compassion training
      increased altruistic redistribution of funds to a victim encountered outside of
      the training context. Furthermore, increased altruistic behavior after compassion
      training was associated with altered activation in brain regions implicated in
      social cognition and emotion regulation, including the inferior parietal cortex
      and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and in DLPFC connectivity with the
      nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that compassion can be cultivated with
      training and that greater altruistic behavior may emerge from increased
      engagement of neural systems implicated in understanding the suffering of other
      people, executive and emotional control, and reward processing.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction on objective
      and subjective sleep parameters and hypnotic medication use of patients with
      insomnia secondary to cervical cancer. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled
      trial enrolled insomnia patient who were caused or worsened by cervical cancer.
      Seventy patients with insomnia caused or aggravated by cervical cancer were at
      random divided into either a usual care group or an 8-week mindfulness-based
      stress reduction group. Subjective sleep parameters, objective sleep parameters
      and hypnotic medication consumption were assessed at baseline, after the program,
      6- and 12-month after finishing the interventions. RESULTS: The results showed
      that mindfulness-based stress reduction had a positive effect on subjective sleep
      parameters (Total wake time: ∆ = 45.32, P < 0.05; Sleep efficacy: ∆ = 6.87,
      P < 0.05; Total sleep time: ∆ = 22.22, P < 0.01). Compared with control group,
      polysomnography data in mindfulness-based stress reduction group were not
      improved significantly. There were no associations between subjective sleep
      parameters and objective sleep parameters. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based stress
      reduction had a definite impact on patients with insomnia that was secondary to
      cervical cancer just after the intervention, but no long-term influences. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of a structured eight-week mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) program on counseling self-efficacy among counseling
      trainees. METHODS: Undergraduate counseling trainees were randomized to an MBCT
      group (n = 25) or a waitlist control group (n = 25) with a crossover trial
      design. Psychological measurements regarding mindfulness, empathy,
      self-compassion, psychological distress, counseling self-efficacy as well as
      neuro-physiological measures including frontal midline theta activity,
      respiration rate, and skin conductance were taken at baseline (T1), after
      intervention (T2), and six-month follow-up (T3). RESULTS: Mindfulness training
      could make significant positive changes in empathy, self-compassion, stress
      reduction, and counseling self-efficacy with this being backed up by both
      psychological and neuro-physiological evidence at T2. However, such differences
      between the two groups had greatly subsided after crossover in which carry-over
      effect and marked improvement were noted in the study and control group,
      respectively, at T3. In addition, mindfulness was the most significant
      determinant that contributed to counseling self-efficacy, followed by
      psychological distress reduction and self-compassion according to the regression
      models. CONCLUSION: Integrating mindfulness into counseling training is
      beneficial for helping profession trainees. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Incorporating
      mindfulness into counseling training can enhance the necessary "being mode"
      qualities in counseling and address self-care issues during training.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression in people with dementia: A
      qualitative study on participant, carer and facilitator experiences.
PG  - 457-476
LID - 10.1177/14713012211046150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression in dementia is common and associated with negative health
      outcomes. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a recommended treatment of
      choice for recurrent depression, but its use for depression in dementia is yet to
      be assessed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences of people
      with depression and dementia who participated in the mindfulness-based cognitive
      therapy intervention and those of their carers and facilitators. METHODS: This
      qualitative study was nested within a randomised controlled feasibility study.
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 people (eight people with
      dementia and depression, six carers and four course facilitators). Thematic
      analysis was used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Several beneficial effects of
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were described. These were a sense of shared
      suffering among the group, greater present moment focus and awareness, various
      positive emotional changes, including greater self-compassion, and benefits for
      carers, such as the reduction of anxiety. Specific aspects of the programme were
      identified as particularly useful, including facilitator characteristics and
      certain mindfulness practices. Carer involvement, cognitive difficulties and
      barriers to home practice influenced engagement with the course. Facilitators
      described adaptations made to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and suggested
      additional modifications for future groups. CONCLUSION: Results of this process
      evaluation suggest that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a potentially
      useful intervention for people with depression in dementia, but that further
      adaptation of the intervention is required to make the programme suitable for
      this clinical population.

TI  - Changes in Salivary Immunoglobulin A, Stress, and Burnout in a Workplace
      Mindfulness Intervention: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19106226 [doi]
LID - 6226
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of a 6-week
      workplace mindfulness- and self-compassion-based intervention (MSCBI) on
      perceived stress, burnout, immune functioning (assessed with the biomarker
      Immunoglobulin A), self-compassion, and experiential avoidance compared to a
      Workplace Stress Management Intervention. Both interventions were contextual,
      i.e., they were carried out in the workplace setting and during working hours. We
      followed a randomised controlled trial study design. The total sample was
      composed of 24 employees of an automotive company. One-way analyses of covariance
      between groups revealed significant differences in post-intervention levels of
      perceived stress, salivary Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), emotional exhaustion,
      self-compassion, and experiential avoidance, after adjusting for pre-test scores.
      The results of this study have several implications. Firstly, it confirms that
      MSCBIs might be more effective than regular psychoeducational interventions for
      work-related stress and burnout treatment. Secondly, sIgA can be used to assess
      immune function state changes when MSCBIs are carried out. Furthermore, these
      results indicate that it is feasible to carry out MSCBIs within companies and
      during working hours, and that these interventions can help effectively manage
      stress and burnout associated with the work environment.

AB  - Loneliness, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety have increased during the
      COVID-19 pandemic. Many of existing mindfulness and compassion-based intervention
      are effective, but are time-intensive, decreasing overall accessibility and
      scalability. Single-session interventions (SSIs) serve as a promising
      alternative. The current pre-registered randomized clinical trial evaluated a
      newly developed, manualized, mindfulness-based single-session intervention. 91
      adults were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) one-hour
      mindfulness only telehealth intervention; (b) one-hour mindfulness and compassion
      telehealth intervention; or (c) one-week waitlist control (before randomization
      to an active intervention). Intervention sessions were conducted by graduate
      students in clinical psychology. The primary outcome was self-reported
      loneliness; secondary outcomes were self-reported perceived stress, depression,
      and anxiety. Using Bayesian multilevel models, we found that compared to the
      waitlist-control, the inclusion of a compassion component led to meaningful
      reductions in perceived stress b = -3.75, 95% HDI [-6.95, -0.59], anxiety b =
      -3.79, 95% HDI [-6.99, -0.53], and depression b = -3.01, 95% HDI [-5.22, -0.78],
      but not loneliness at the 1-week follow-up. Results suggest that a single-session
      mindfulness and compassion intervention may lead to meaningful reductions in
      perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression, but not
      loneliness. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A large proportion of mindfulness-based therapy trials report
      statistically significant results, even in the context of very low statistical
      power. The objective of the present study was to characterize the reporting of
      "positive" results in randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy.
      We also assessed mindfulness-based therapy trial registrations for indications of
      possible reporting bias and reviewed recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses
      to determine whether reporting biases were identified. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane
      CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched for
      randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. The number of positive
      trials was described and compared to the number that might be expected if
      mindfulness-based therapy were similarly effective compared to individual therapy
      for depression. Trial registries were searched for mindfulness-based therapy
      registrations. CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and
      SCOPUS were also searched for mindfulness-based therapy systematic reviews and
      meta-analyses. RESULTS: 108 (87%) of 124 published trials reported ≥1 positive
      outcome in the abstract, and 109 (88%) concluded that mindfulness-based therapy
      was effective, 1.6 times greater than the expected number of positive trials
      based on effect size d = 0.55 (expected number positive trials = 65.7). Of 21
      trial registrations, 13 (62%) remained unpublished 30 months post-trial
      completion. No trial registrations adequately specified a single primary outcome
      measure with time of assessment. None of 36 systematic reviews and meta-analyses
      concluded that effect estimates were overestimated due to reporting biases.
      CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of mindfulness-based therapy trials with
      statistically significant results may overstate what would occur in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based
      treatment for depression. The current study focused on the long-term outcomes of
      MBCT for chronically, treatment-resistant depressed patients during a 6-months
      follow-up period. Additionally, predictors of treatment outcomes were explored.
      METHOD: The outcomes of MBCT on depressive symptoms, remission rates, quality of
      life, rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion were investigated in a
      cohort of chronically, treatment-resistant depressed outpatients (N = 106), who
      had taken part in an RCT comparing MBCT with treatment-as-usual (TAU). Measures
      were assessed pre-MBCT, post-MBCT, at 3-months follow-up, and at 6-months
      follow-up. RESULTS: Results of linear mixed effect models and Bayesian repeated
      measures ANOVA's reveal that depressive symptoms, quality of life, rumination,
      mindfulness skills and self-compassion consolidated during follow-up. Remission
      rates even further increased over the course of follow-up. When controlling for
      symptoms at baseline, higher baseline levels of rumination predicted lower
      depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6-month follow-up. No other predictors
      (i.e. duration of current depressive episode, level of treatment-resistance,
      childhood trauma, mindfulness skills, self-compassion) were found. LIMITATIONS:
      All participants received MBCT, therefore time or other non-specific effects
      might have influenced the results and replication studies including a control
      conditions are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the clinical benefits
      of MBCT for chronically, treatment-resistant depressed patients persist up to
      6 months after completing MBCT. Duration of the current episode, level of
      treatment-resistance, childhood trauma and baseline levels of mindfulness skills
      and self-compassion did not predict treatment outcome. When controlling for
      baseline depressive symptoms participants with high levels of rumination seem to
      benefit more; however more research is needed. TRIAL REGISTRY: Dutch Trial

TI  - Self-compassion, Stress, and Eating Behaviour: Exploring the Effects of
      Self-compassion on Dietary Choice and Food Craving After Laboratory-Induced
      Stress.
PG  - 438-447
LID - 10.1007/s12529-022-10110-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress has been linked to high-fat and high-sugar food consumption.
      Self-compassion is associated with better emotional and physiological responses
      to stress. The current study explored whether trait self-compassion or induced
      state self-compassion could improve dietary choice and food craving after a
      stress induction. METHOD: Fifty-three university students completed an online
      survey assessing self-compassion, eating restraint, and general perceived stress
      before attending a laboratory visit. In the laboratory, participants were
      randomised to a neutral writing control or a self-compassion letter writing
      condition before a stress induction. Measures of heart rate, heart rate
      variability, state self-compassion, dietary choice, and state food cravings were
      taken. RESULTS: The brief self-compassion intervention did not sufficiently
      increase state self-compassion in the intervention group compared to the neutral
      writing condition. There was no effect of the written self-compassion
      intervention on heart rate, heart rate variability, dietary choice, or food
      craving. However, higher trait self-compassion was associated with healthier
      dietary choices (F(1, 49) = 5.35, p = .025, R(2) = .098). CONCLUSION: Results
      suggest that higher trait self-compassion improved dietary choice after stress in
      a controlled environment in a university population. Further research is
      warranted to explore whether brief self-compassion interventions can improve
      state self-compassion and thereby influence dietary choices and food cravings
      after a stress induction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a stressful condition. Mental health
      comorbidity is common. Stress can increase the risk of depression, reduce quality
      of life (QOL), and possibly exacerbate disease activity in MS. Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) may help, but has been little studied in MS, particularly
      among more disabled individuals. METHODS: The objective of this study was to test
      the feasibility and likely effectiveness of a standard MBSR course for people
      with MS. Participant eligibility included: age > 18, any type of MS, an Expanded
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) </= 7.0. Participants received either MBSR or
      wait-list control. Outcome measures were collected at baseline,
      post-intervention, and three-months later. Primary outcomes were perceived stress
      and QOL. Secondary outcomes were common MS symptoms, mindfulness, and
      self-compassion. RESULTS: Fifty participants were recruited and randomised (25
      per group). Trial retention and outcome measure completion rates were 90% at
      post-intervention, and 88% at 3 months. Sixty percent of participants completed
      the course. Immediately post-MBSR, perceived stress improved with a large effect
      size (ES 0.93; p < 0.01), compared to very small beneficial effects on QOL (ES
      0.17; p = 0.48). Depression (ES 1.35; p < 0.05), positive affect (ES 0.87; p =
      0.13), anxiety (ES 0.85; p = 0.05), and self-compassion (ES 0.80; p < 0.01) also
      improved with large effect sizes. At three-months post-MBSR (study endpoint)
      improvements in perceived stress were diminished to a small effect size (ES 0.26;
      p = 0.39), were negligible for QOL (ES 0.08; p = 0.71), but were large for
      mindfulness (ES 1.13; p < 0.001), positive affect (ES 0.90; p = 0.54),
      self-compassion (ES 0.83; p < 0.05), anxiety (ES 0.82; p = 0.15), and prospective
      memory (ES 0.81; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment, retention, and data
      collection demonstrate that a RCT of MBSR is feasible for people with MS. Trends
      towards improved outcomes suggest that a larger definitive RCT may be warranted.
      However, optimisation changes may be required to render more stable the
      beneficial treatment effects on stress and depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Finding kindness: A randomized controlled trial of an online self-compassion
      intervention for weight management (SC4WM).
PG  - 37-58
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12686 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Weight loss is hard to achieve and even harder to maintain.
      Engaging in effortful behavioural change to manage body weight can sometimes
      result in feelings of guilt and shame. Self-compassion, the tendency to find
      kindness for oneself in times of struggle, may facilitate coping with the unique
      challenges of weight management. This study assessed whether a remotely delivered
      self-compassion intervention improved weight management outcomes when delivered
      as a supplement to an existing digital behavioural weight management programme,
      Weight Watchers (WW). METHOD: Using a mixed-method study design, 249 adults
      seeking to manage weight were randomized to either the WW programme or WW
      supplemented with the self-compassion for weight management intervention (SC4WM).
      Participants completed measures of self-compassion, eating behaviour, physical
      activity, body weight and emotional well-being along with potential moderators,
      including weight self-stigma, eating restraint, psychological coping and
      perceived stress at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks) and follow-up
      (12 weeks). RESULTS: There was no evidence that the SC4WM intervention had a
      significantly different effect than WW alone. Other than body weight, all
      outcomes improved over time in both groups. Self-compassion was slightly higher
      overall in the SC4WM group (p = .05), with this group reporting higher
      self-kindness at 4 weeks (p = .014) and lower self-judgement at 12 weeks
      (p = .023) compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the SC4WM
      intervention group did show a small increase in self-kindness and reduction in
      self-judgement, weight management outcomes were not improved over and above the
      existing WW programme. Recommendations for adapting the SC4WM intervention to
      improve efficacy to augment weight management outcomes are provided.

      psychophysiological and self-report measures.

AB  - Repeated exposure to stressors, even if mild, may alter the efficiency of optimal
      stress responses and hinder emotion regulation skills. Mindfulness meditation, by
      strengthening self-regulation and awareness, may optimize the efficiency of
      physiological, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to stressful events but
      typically requires notable commitment to practice, which often leads to
      disengagement. Recent research suggested that such practices may be made more
      accessible and that the potential for self-enhancement and stress management of
      meditation might be improved by supporting mental training with wearable
      neurofeedback devices able to inform the practicer on ongoing modulation of
      bodily and brain activity. This study aimed at testing the effect of such novel
      training approach based on the integration of mental training with brain-sensing
      wearable devices on physiological (heart rate and variability) and subjective
      markers of stress (perceived stress, anxiety, and mood states). Participants
      (N = 55) have been randomly divided into an active control (CONTg) and an
      experimental group (EXPg). Both groups completed a four-week training constituted
      by brief daily activities based on mindfulness practices. Experimental
      participants practiced with the support of dedicated brain-sensing devices. By
      analyzing pre- and post-training assessments, we observed relevantly decreased
      stress and anxiety measures in EXPg, as well as relevantly decreased mental
      fatigue and increased vigor. EXPg also showed improved physiological markers of
      vagal tone both at rest and during exposure to a cognitive stressor. Reported
      findings add to the limited available literature on potential effects of
      technology-supported mental training protocols for promoting subjective
      well-being and enhancing self-regulation skills.

TI  - Impact of mindfulness-based and health self-management interventions on
      mindfulness, self-compassion, and physical activity in older adults with
      subjective cognitive decline: A secondary analysis of the SCD-Well randomized
      controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Older adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have a
      higher risk of dementia. Reducing this risk through behavioral interventions,
      which can increase emotional well-being (mindfulness and compassion) and physical
      activity, is crucial in SCD. METHODS: SCD-Well is a multicenter, observer-blind,
      randomized, controlled, superiority trial. Three hundred forty-seven participants
      (mean [standard deviation] age: 72.7 [6.9] years; 64.6% women) were recruited
      from memory clinics in four European sites to assess the impact of an 8-week
      caring mindfulness-based approach for seniors (CMBAS) and a health
      self-management program (HSMP) on mindfulness, self-compassion, and physical
      activity. RESULTS: CMBAS showed a significant within-group increase in
      self-compassion from baseline to post-intervention and both a within- and
      between-group increase to follow-up visit (24 weeks). HSMP showed a significant
      within- and between-group increase in physical activity from baseline to
      post-intervention and to follow-up visit. DISCUSSION: Non-pharmacological
      interventions can differentially promote modifiable factors linked to healthy
      aging in older adults with SCD.

LID - 10.1089/acm.2016.0002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a comprehensive residential mind-body
      program on well-being. DESIGN: The Self-Directed Biological Transformation
      Initiative was a quasi-randomized trial comparing the effects of participation in
      a 6-day Ayurvedic system of medicine-based comprehensive residential program with
      a 6-day residential vacation at the same retreat location. SETTING: Retreat
      setting. PARTICIPANTS: 69 healthy women (n = 58) and men (n = 11) (mean
      age ± standard deviation, 53.6 ± 12 years). INTERVENTION: The Ayurvedic
      intervention addressed physical and emotional well-being through group meditation
      and yoga, massage, diet, adaptogenic herbs, lectures, and journaling. OUTCOME
      MEASURES: A battery of standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: Participants in the
      Ayurvedic program showed significant and sustained increases in ratings of
      spirituality (p < 0.01) and gratitude (p < 0.05) compared with the vacation
      group, which showed no change. The Ayurvedic participants also showed increased
      ratings for self-compassion (p < 0.01) as well as less anxiety at the 1-month
      follow-up (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a short-term intensive
      program providing holistic instruction and experience in mind-body healing
      practices can lead to significant and sustained increases in perceived well-being
      and that relaxation alone is not enough to improve certain aspects of well-being.

PG  - 154-166
LID - 10.1177/1742395317715504 [doi]
AB  - Objectives To gather views from patients with multiple sclerosis after completing
      a standard eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction course and optimise and
      test a modified version as required. Methods Two successive groups of 25 multiple
      sclerosis patients received mindfulness-based stress reduction in a wait-list
      randomised controlled trial. Seventeen participants and two mindfulness-based
      stress reduction instructors were individually interviewed after the first
      (standard) course and 16 participants and the same two instructors were
      interviewed following the second (optimised) course. Interviews were analysed
      using a thematic approach. Results Mindfulness-based stress reduction was well
      received in both groups, with participants describing a beneficial shift in
      awareness. An initial (at times unpleasant) increase in awareness of disability
      was generally followed by greater acceptance and self-compassion. Other benefits
      reported included improved relationships, walking and sleep, with less stress and
      pain. Mindful-movement and mindful walking were problematic in group 1. This
      component of mindfulness-based stress reduction was simplified in group 2. A
      pre-course orientation session was introduced, and some organisational changes
      made based on feedback from group 1. Feedback from group 2 was positive in all
      these areas. Discussion Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears beneficial to
      people with multiple sclerosis, albeit mindful-movement required some
      modification. Contextual and organisational issues also appear important in this
      population.

TI  - The effectiveness of smartphone compassion training on stress among Swedish
      university students: A pilot randomized trial.
PG  - 927-945
LID - 10.1002/jclp.23092 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a 6-week smartphone compassion training
      intervention on mental health. METHOD: Fifty-seven Swedish university students
      (mean age = 25, SD = 5) reporting high levels of stress were randomized to
      compassion training (n = 23), mindfulness (n = 19), or waitlist (n = 15). RESULT:
      Multilevel models indicated that both compassion and mindfulness training
      increased self-compassion compared to the waitlist, while only compassion
      significantly reduced stress. Between-group effect sizes for compassion compared
      to waitlist were large for both self-compassion (d = 1.61) and stress (d = 0.94).
      Compassion and mindfulness did not differ significantly, but effect sizes were in
      favor of compassion. Secondary outcomes indicated positive effects on emotional
      awareness, while no effect was found for global psychological distress.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that compassion training via a smartphone
      application can improve self-compassion and reduce stress among university
      students. Future studies in larger clinical samples are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is growing evidence that mindfulness has positive consequences
      for both psychological and physical health in both clinical and non-clinical
      populations. The potential benefits of mindfulness underpin a range of
      therapeutic intervention approaches designed to increase mindfulness in both
      clinical and community contexts. Self-guided mindfulness-based interventions may
      be a way to increase access to the benefits of mindfulness. This study explored
      whether a brief, online, mindfulness-based intervention can increase mindfulness
      and reduce perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms within a student
      population. METHOD: One hundred and four students were randomly allocated to
      either immediately start a two-week, self-guided, online, mindfulness-based
      intervention or a wait-list control. Measures of mindfulness, perceived stress
      and anxiety/depression were administered before and after the intervention
      period. RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis identified significant group by time
      interactions for mindfulness skills, perceived stress and anxiety/depression
      symptoms. Participation in the intervention was associated with significant
      improvements in all measured domains, where no significant changes on these
      measures were found for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This provides evidence in
      support of the feasibility and effectiveness of shorter self-guided
      mindfulness-based interventions. The limitations and implications of this study
      for clinical practice are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify moderators of treatment effect (i.e.
      depressive symptoms and well-being) of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
      and Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI) in patients with bipolar disorder.
      METHODS: Data were drawn from two multicenter randomized controlled trials
      investigating effectiveness of MBCT vs treatment as usual (TAU; n = 144) and PPI
      vs TAU (n = 97) in bipolar disorder. Outcomes were assessed at baseline,
      posttreatment, and 12 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using separate
      linear regression models, comparing the pooled MBCT or PPI outcomes to TAU, and
      comparing MBCT to PPI. RESULTS: The exploratory analyses not corrected for
      multiple comparisons showed a number of variables that were associated with
      stronger response to the interventions, including higher baseline anxiety, lower
      well-being, and lower levels of self-focused positive rumination, well-being, and
      self-compassion, and variables associated with a stronger response to either MBCT
      (higher levels of depression and anxiety and being married) or PPI (being male).
      After correcting for multiple testing, depressive symptoms appeared to be the
      most robust variable associated with better response to MBCT than PPI.
      LIMITATIONS: The RCTs handled slightly different enrollment criteria and outcome
      measures. CONCLUSIONS: The most robust finding is that patients with more severe
      symptomatology seem to benefit more from MBCT than PPI. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
      This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT
      interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. However, before definite
      treatment assignment criteria can be formulated and implemented in clinical
      practice, these findings should be replicated.

TI  - Online mindfulness-based intervention for women with pregnancy distress: design
      of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 159

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological distress during pregnancy is common: up to 20% of the
      childbearing women experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. Apart from the
      adverse effects on the woman herself, pregnancy distress can negatively affect
      pregnancy outcomes, infant health, postpartum mother-child interaction and child
      development. Therefore, the development of interventions that reduce pregnancy
      distress is very important. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promising
      positive effects on pregnancy distress, but there is a need for randomized
      controlled trials with sufficient power. Trials on online MBIs, which are readily
      accessible and not expensive, also show positive effects on stress reduction in
      non-pregnant populations. Moreover, specific working mechanisms of MBIs remain
      unclear. The aim of the current study is to test the effectiveness of an online
      MBI in pregnant women with pregnancy distress, as well as exploring potential
      working mechanisms. METHODS: The current study is a randomized controlled trial
      with repeated measures. Consenting women with elevated levels of pregnancy
      distress will be randomized into an intervention group (MBI) or control group
      (care as usual) around 12 weeks of pregnancy, with an intended sample size of 103
      women in each group. The primary outcome, pregnancy distress, will be assessed
      via questionnaires at baseline, halfway through the intervention and post
      intervention in both intervention and control group, and after 8 weeks follow-up
      in the intervention group. Secondary outcomes are mindfulness skills, rumination
      and self-compassion, which are also seen as potential working mechanisms, and
      will be assessed via questionnaires before intervention, halfway through the
      intervention, post intervention and after 8 weeks follow-up in the intervention
      group. Tertiary outcome variables are obstetric data and will be collected from
      the obstetric records for both intervention and control group. Analyses will be
      based on the intention-to-treat principle. Multilevel regression models for
      repeated measures (mixed models) will be used to evaluate changes in primary and
      secondary outcome variables. Tertiary outcomes will be compared between groups
      using independent t-tests and Chi Square analyses. DISCUSSION: The trial is
      expected to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of online MBIs during
      pregnancy in women with pregnancy distress and to evaluate potential working
      mechanisms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03917745, registered on 4

AB  - Mindfulness training has been used to improve emotional wellbeing in early
      adolescents. However, little is known about treatment outcome moderators, or
      individual differences that may differentially impact responses to treatment. The
      current study focused on gender as a potential moderator for affective outcomes
      in response to school-based mindfulness training. Sixth grade students (N = 100)
      were randomly assigned to either the six weeks of mindfulness meditation or the
      active control group as part of a history class curriculum. Participants in the
      mindfulness meditation group completed short mindfulness meditation sessions four
      to five times per week, in addition to didactic instruction (Asian history). The
      control group received matched experiential activity in addition to didactic
      instruction (African history) from the same teacher with no meditation component.
      Self-reported measures of emotional wellbeing/affect, mindfulness, and
      self-compassion were obtained at pre and post intervention. Meditators reported
      greater improvement in emotional wellbeing compared to those in the control
      group. Importantly, gender differences were detected, such that female meditators
      reported greater increases in positive affect compared to females in the control
      group, whereas male meditators and control males displayed equivalent gains.
      Uniquely among females but not males, increases in self-reported self-compassion
      were associated with improvements in affect. These findings support the efficacy
      of school-based mindfulness interventions, and interventions tailored to
      accommodate distinct developmental needs of female and male adolescents.

AB  - The beneficial effects of mindful awareness and mindfulness meditation training
      on physical and psychological health are thought to be mediated in part through
      changes in underlying brain processes. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) allows
      identification of functional networks in the brain. It has been used to examine
      state-dependent activity and is well suited for studying states such as
      meditation. We applied fcMRI to determine if Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
      (MBSR) training is effective in altering intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs).
      Healthy women were randomly assigned to participate in an 8-week
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training course or an 8-week waiting
      period. After 8 weeks, fMRI data (1.5T) was acquired while subjects rested with
      eyes closed, with the instruction to pay attention to the sounds of the scanner
      environment. Group independent component analysis was performed to investigate
      training-related changes in functional connectivity. Significant MBSR-related
      differences in functional connectivity were found mainly in auditory/salience and
      medial visual networks. Relative to findings in the control group, MBSR subjects
      showed (1) increased functional connectivity within auditory and visual networks,
      (2) increased functional connectivity between auditory cortex and areas
      associated with attentional and self-referential processes, (3) stronger
      anticorrelation between auditory and visual cortex, and (4) stronger
      anticorrelation between visual cortex and areas associated with attentional and
      self-referential processes. These findings suggest that 8 weeks of mindfulness
      meditation training alters intrinsic functional connectivity in ways that may
      reflect a more consistent attentional focus, enhanced sensory processing, and
      reflective awareness of sensory experience.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compassion is critical for complementary and conventional care, but
      little is known about its direct physiologic effects. This study tested the
      feasibility of delivering two lengths of time (10 and 20 minutes) and two
      strategies (tactile and nontactile) for a practitioner to nonverbally communicate
      compassion to subjects who were blind to the interventions. METHODS: Healthy
      volunteers were informed that we were testing the effects of time and touch on
      the autonomic nervous system. Each subject underwent five sequential study
      periods in one study session: (1) warm-up; (2) control-with the practitioner
      while both read neutral material; (3) rest; (4) intervention-with practitioner
      meditating on loving-kindness toward the subject; and (5) rest. Subjects were
      randomized to receive one of four interventions: (1) 10 minutes tactile; (2) 20
      minutes tactile; (3) 10 minutes nontactile; or (4) 20 minutes nontactile. During
      all interventions, the practitioner meditated on loving-kindness toward the
      subject. For tactile interventions, the practitioner touched subjects on arms,
      legs, and hands; for nontactile interventions, the practitioner pretended to
      read. Subjects' autonomic activity, including heart rate, was measured
      continuously. Subjects completed visual analog scales for well-being, including
      relaxation and peacefulness, at warm-up; postcontrol; immediately
      postintervention; and after the postintervention rest and were asked about what
      they and the practitioner had done during each study period. RESULTS: The 20
      subjects' mean age was 24.3 ± 4 years; 16 were women. The practitioner maintained
      a meditative state during all interventions as reflected in lower respiratory
      rate, and subjects remained blind to the practitioner's meditative activity.
      Overall, interventions significantly decreased heart rate (P < .01), and although
      other changes did not reach statistical significance, they were in the expected
      direction, with generally greater effects for the tactile than nontactile
      strategies and for 20-minute than 10-minute doses. CONCLUSIONS: Two strategies
      are feasible for blinding subjects to nonverbal communication of compassion; even
      with blinding, nonverbal communication of compassion affects subjects' autonomic
      nervous system. These results should be replicated in larger samples, including
      patient populations, and mechanisms sought to explain observed effects.
      Compassion is not only good care; it may also be good medicine.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindful self-compassion therapy on psychopathology symptoms,
      psychological distress and life expectancy in infertile women treated with in
      vitro fertilization: a two-arm double-blind parallel randomized controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infertility is a prominent problem affecting millions of couples
      worldwide. Recently, there has been a hightened emphasis on elucidating the
      subtle linkages between infertility treatment leveraging assisted reproductive
      technology and the complex realm of psychological challenges, as well as efforts
      in implementation of psychological interventions.The Mindful Self-Compassion
      (MSC) program seeks to improve self-compassion, compassion for others,
      mindfulness, and life satisfaction while reducing depression, anxiety, and
      stress. In the current study, an MSC intervention was performed on infertile
      women (IW) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) to assess the effectiveness of
      this intervention in reducing psychological distress and psychopathological
      symptoms and enhancing life expectancy. METHODS: Fifty-seven IW undergoing IVF
      were randomly allocated to two groups: MSC (n = 29) or treatment as usual
      (TAU; n = 28). Participants in MSC met once a week for two hours for eight weeks
      and attended a half-day meditation retreat. The Synder's Hope questionnaire and
      the Revised 90-Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used as the primary outcome
      measures. Data were obtained before the intervention, immediately after the
      intervention, and two months post-intervention. Repeated measures of ANCOVA and
      paired t-tests in all assessment points were used to compare the MSC and the TAU
      groups in outcomes. RESULTS: In the MSC group, hopelessness, anger-hostility,
      anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity difficulties, and depression were
      significantly reduced compared with the TAU group, and those improvements
      persisted at the two-month follow-up. Reliable change index revealed that the MSC
      group's gains were both clinically significant and durable. CONCLUSIONS: MSC can
      facilitate higher life satisfaction and mental well-being for IW undergoing IVF
      by reducing psychological distress, psychopathological symptoms, and
      hopelessness. These encouraging findings call for more research into the
      effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies in addressing psychological problems
      among IW undergoing IVF.

      intervention for social anxiety disorder: Preliminary findings.
PG  - 200-218
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2502 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have evaluated the possible efficacy of mindfulness-based
      interventions (MBIs) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, few trials have
      compared MBIs with a first-line treatment. This study evaluated the relative
      efficacy of an MBI adapted for SAD (MBI-SAD) to cognitive behaviour group therapy
      (CBGT) for SAD. Participants were randomized to 12 weekly group sessions of the
      MBI-SAD (n = 52) or CBGT (n = 45). Results revealed that CBGT fared better than
      the MBI-SAD in reducing clinician- and self-rated social anxiety severity. The
      difference between the MBI-SAD and CBGT exceeded the prespecified noninferiority
      margin for our primary outcome the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, but findings
      are inconclusive as the width of the confidence interval extended in both
      directions surrounding the noninferiority margin. The MBI-SAD compared favourably
      with CBGT in improving other indices of well-being (depression, self-esteem,
      satisfaction with life, social adjustment). Contrary to expectation, the MBI-SAD
      did not produce greater changes in mindfulness and self-compassion than CBGT.
      Overall, results confirm that CBGT is robust treatment for SAD and should be
      considered as first-line treatment.

      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 314

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a very disabling condition
      with a chronic course, if left untreated. Though cognitive behavioral treatment
      (CBT) with or without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is the
      method of choice, up to one third of individuals with obsessive-compulsive
      disorder (OCD) do not respond to treatment in terms of at least 35% improvement
      of symptoms. Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an 8-week group
      program that could help OCD patients with no or only partial response to CBT to
      reduce OC symptoms and develop a helpful attitude towards obsessions and
      compulsive urges. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, bicentric,
      assessor-blinded, randomized, actively-controlled clinical trial. 128 patients
      with primary diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-IV and no or only partial response
      to CBT will be recruited from in- and outpatient services as well as online
      forums and the media. Patients will be randomized to either an MBCT intervention
      group or to a psycho-educative coaching group (OCD-EP) as an active control
      condition. All participants will undergo eight weekly sessions with a length of
      120 minutes each of a structured group program. We hypothesize that MBCT will be
      superior to OCD-EP in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the
      Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) following the intervention and at
      6- and 12-months-follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include depressive
      symptoms, quality of life, metacognitive beliefs, self-compassion, mindful
      awareness and approach-avoidance tendencies as measured by an approach avoidance
      task. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will elucidate the benefits of MBCT
      for OCD patients who did not sufficiently benefit from CBT. To our knowledge,
      this is the first randomized controlled study assessing the effects of MBCT on
      symptom severity and associated parameters in OCD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German

TI  - The effect of revised process recording on self-focus and self-compassion: A
      randomized controlled pilot study.
PG  - 1282-1291
LID - 10.1111/ppc.12687 [doi]
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-five university nursing students in Japan participated
      in this randomized controlled trial. The revised process recording referred to
      self-compassion. Both the control and intervention groups completed the
      self-compassion scale (SCS) pre- and post-intervention. A repeated two-way
      analysis of variance examined the interaction effect of time × group on the SCS
      subscales. FINDINGS: A significant interaction effect was observed only for
      mindfulness; the score only increased in the intervention group. IMPLICATIONS FOR
      NURSING PRACTICE: The revised process recording might facilitate self-compassion,
      making it appropriate for nursing education.

TI  - Contemplative/emotion training reduces negative emotional behavior and promotes
      prosocial responses.
PG  - 338-50
LID - 10.1037/a0026118 [doi]
AB  - Contemplative practices are believed to alleviate psychological problems,
      cultivate prosocial behavior and promote self-awareness. In addition,
      psychological science has developed tools and models for understanding the mind
      and promoting well-being. Additional effort is needed to combine frameworks and
      techniques from these traditions to improve emotional experience and
      socioemotional behavior. An 8-week intensive (42 hr) meditation/emotion
      regulation training intervention was designed by experts in contemplative
      traditions and emotion science to reduce "destructive enactment of emotions" and
      enhance prosocial responses. Participants were 82 healthy female schoolteachers
      who were randomly assigned to a training group or a wait-list control group, and
      assessed preassessment, postassessment, and 5 months after training completion.
      Assessments included self-reports and experimental tasks to capture changes in
      emotional behavior. The training group reported reduced trait negative affect,
      rumination, depression, and anxiety, and increased trait positive affect and
      mindfulness compared to the control group. On a series of behavioral tasks, the
      training increased recognition of emotions in others (Micro-Expression Training
      Tool), protected trainees from some of the psychophysiological effects of an
      experimental threat to self (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST), appeared to
      activate cognitive networks associated with compassion (lexical decision
      procedure), and affected hostile behavior in the Marital Interaction Task. Most
      effects at postassessment that were examined at follow-up were maintained
      (excluding positive affect, TSST rumination, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia
      recovery). Findings suggest that increased awareness of mental processes can
      influence emotional behavior, and they support the benefit of integrating
      contemplative theories/practices with psychological models and methods of emotion
      regulation.

TI  - A Brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Primary Care Physicians: A Pilot
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 83-91
LID - 10.1177/1559827616629121 [doi]
AB  - Primary care physicians experience high rates of burnout, which results in
      diminished quality of life, poorer quality of care, and workforce attrition. In
      this randomized controlled trial, our primary aim was to examine the impact of a
      brief mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on burnout, stress, mindfulness,
      compassion, and resilience among physicians. A total of 33 physicians completed
      the baseline assessment and were randomized to the Mindful Medicine Curriculum
      (MMC; n = 17) or waitlist control group (n = 16). Participants completed
      self-report measures at baseline, post-MBI, and 3-month follow-up. We also
      analyzed satisfaction with doctor communication (DCC) and overall doctor rating
      (ODR) data from patients of the physicians in our sample. Participants in the MMC
      group reported significant improvements in stress (P < .001), mindfulness (P =
      .05), emotional exhaustion (P = .004), and depersonalization (P = .01) whereas in
      the control group, there were no improvements on these outcomes. Although the MMC
      had no impact on patient-reported DCC or ODR, among the entire sample at
      baseline, DCC and ODR were significantly correlated with several physician
      outcomes, including resilience and personal achievement. Overall, these findings
      suggest that a brief MBI can have a positive impact on physician well-being and
      potentially enhance patient care.

TI  - Potential treatment mechanisms in a mindfulness-based intervention for people
      with progressive multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 859-880
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12201 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore putative mediators of a mindfulness-based intervention to
      decrease distress in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to explore the
      patients' perspectives on this intervention. DESIGN: We used an explanatory mixed
      methods design incorporating quantitative data from a pilot randomized control
      trial and a qualitative interview study with people who completed the mindfulness
      intervention. METHODS: People with MS (n = 40) completed standardized measures of
      distress (outcome), and acceptance, decentring, self-compassion, and
      self-efficacy (potential mediators). Semi-structured interviews (n = 15) of
      patients' experiences of the mindfulness intervention were analysed deductively
      and inductively. RESULTS: Decentring post-intervention explained 13% of the
      3-month change in distress and between 27% and 31% of concurrent changes in
      distress. Acceptance changed only slightly, and as a result, the indirect effect
      accounts for only 2% of future distress and between 3% and 11% of concurrent
      distress. Qualitative data showed that acceptance and self-compassion needed more
      time to develop, whereas decentring could be implemented readily after being
      introduced in the sessions. Self-efficacy also had a large mediating effect.
      Participants in their interviews talked about group dynamics and prior
      expectations as essential elements that determine their engagement with the
      course and their level of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness interventions
      for people with a chronic progressive condition may benefit from focusing on
      helping them to accept daily challenges and teach them to recognize their
      thoughts and feelings, allowing time for acceptance and self-compassion to
      develop. Group dynamics also play a fundamental role in the success of the
      mindfulness interventions. Statement of Contribution What is already known on
      this subject? Mindfulness courses improve psychological well-being for people
      with chronic conditions. Mindfulness courses have been successful in improving
      psychological well-being and symptom management for people with multiple
      sclerosis but we do not know how these courses work. What does this study add?
      Decentering and self-efficacy appear to be key mechanisms leading to reduced
      distress. Acceptance and self-compassion may need more time and practice to
      develop. Group dynamics and expectations of the mindfulness courses were also
      important elements of mindfulness.

TI  - Improved quality of life and psychological symptoms following mindfulness and
      cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis and their mediating role for
      cognition: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 4361-4372
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12327-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently gives rise to depressive and
      anxiety symptoms, but these are often undertreated. This study investigated the
      effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and cognitive rehabilitation
      therapy (CRT) on psychological outcomes and quality of life (QoL), and whether
      they mediate treatment effects on MS-related cognitive problems. METHODS: This
      randomized controlled trial included MS patients with cognitive complaints
      (n = 99) and compared MBCT (n = 32) and CRT (n = 32) to enhanced treatment as
      usual (n = 35). Baseline, post-treatment and 6-months follow-up assessments
      included patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and cognitive outcomes
      (self-reported and neuropsychological assessment). PROMS concerned psychological
      symptoms, well-being, QoL, and daily life function. Linear mixed models indicated
      intervention effects on PROMS and mediation effects of PROMS on cognitive
      outcomes. RESULTS: MBCT positively affected depressive symptoms (Cohen's d
      (d) = -0.46), fatigue (d = -0.39), brooding (d = -0.34), mindfulness skills
      (d = 0.49), and mental QoL (d = -0.73) at post-treatment. Effects on mindfulness
      skills remained significant 6 months later (d = 0.42). CRT positively affected
      depressive symptoms (d = -0.46), mindfulness skills (d = 0.37), and mental QoL
      (d = -0.45) at post-treatment, but not at 6-month follow-up. No effects on
      anxiety, well-being, self-compassion, physical QoL, and daily life function were
      found. Treatment effects on self-reported, but not objective, cognition were
      mediated by psychological symptoms and mindfulness skills. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT and
      CRT reduced a wide array of psychological symptoms and improved mental QoL. These
      improvements seemed to impact self-reported cognitive problems after both
      treatments, whereas objective cognitive improvements after MBCT seemed
      independent of improvement in psychological symptoms. Future studies should
      investigate long-term sustainability of these beneficial effects. TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered in the Dutch Trial registry
      on 31 May 2017 (NL6285; https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NTR6459

TI  - Extremely brief mindfulness interventions for women undergoing breast biopsies: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 685-692
LID - 10.1007/s10549-018-4869-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mindfulness-based programs can reduce stress and help practitioners to
      have positive attitudes in their daily lives. This randomized controlled trial
      evaluated the impact of brief Mindfulness interventions on quantitative and
      qualitative stress parameters in patients undergoing imaging-guided breast
      biopsies. METHODS: Eighty-two women undergoing percutaneous imaging-guided breast
      biopsy were randomized into two groups: MBI group or standard care group. One
      week before the biopsy procedure, on the waiting room and during the biopsy
      procedure, the MBI group was exposed to mindfulness techniques and the standard
      care group received supportive dialogue from the biopsy team. Participants
      completed questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety and stress, demographics,
      and medical history, besides evaluating their pain experience through a visual
      analogue scale for pain and had their systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
      initial and final temperate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and salivary cortisol
      measured. RESULTS: Participation in the mindfulness intervention group was
      associated with reduced levels of perceived stress, blood pressure, heart rate,
      and oxygen saturation compared to participation in the standard care group (P
      values < 0.05). No difference was observed regarding salivary cortisol levels,
      peripheral temperature, and pain perception between the two studied groups.
      CONCLUSION: Results indicate that an extremely brief mindfulness intervention is
      a feasible intervention, suggesting that Mindfulness-based programs may be
      beneficial to reduce discomfort in acutely stressful settings.

AB  - In the last decade of research on metacognition, the literature has been focused
      on understanding its mechanism, function and scope; however, little is known
      about whether metacognitive capacity can be trained. The specificity of the
      potential training procedure is in particular still largely unknown. In this
      study, we evaluate whether metacognition is trainable through generic meditation
      training, and if so, which component of meditation would be instrumental in this
      improvement. To this end, we evaluated participants' metacognitive efficiency
      before and after two types of meditation training protocols: the first focused on
      mental cues (Mental Monitoring [MM] training), whereas the second focused on body
      cues (Self-observation of the Body [SoB] training). Results indicated that while
      metacognitive efficiency was stable in MM training group, it was significantly
      reduced in the SoB group after training. This suggests that metacognition should
      not be conceived as a stable capacity but rather as a malleable skill.

TI  - Attachment insecurity moderates emotion responses to mindfulness and
      loving-kindness meditation in adults raised in low socioeconomic status
      households.
PG  - 1101-1118
LID - 10.1037/emo0001049 [doi]
AB  - Research on attachment theory holds that insecure attachment influences people's
      daily social and emotional experiences. Mindfulness meditation and
      loving-kindness meditation have been associated with improvements in physical and
      mental well-being often through their influence on emotion experience and
      regulation. Yet, little research has examined how emotional well-being may be
      improved in insecurely attached individuals through meditation practice. We
      suspected that the emotion profiles of anxious and avoidant attachment may shift
      with meditation training, both across time and on a particular day. Improving
      emotional well-being may be especially consequential for those most at risk for
      negative health outcomes in late life. A diverse community sample of midlife
      adults raised in low-SES homes (N = 113; 55% white, 87.5% female) completed daily
      emotion reports for 10 weeks, during which they received 6 weeks of meditation
      training, randomized to either loving-kindness or mindfulness meditation
      practice. Results from growth curve analyses revealed that individuals with
      greater attachment anxiety and randomized to mindfulness meditation reported
      significant increases over time in positive emotions alongside decreases in
      negative emotions. Those high in attachment avoidance reported significant
      decreases in negative emotions in both meditation groups. On the daily level,
      within-person dose-response analyses revealed that individuals with greater
      attachment anxiety showed the most consistent dose-response relations between the
      duration of either meditation practice and same-day increases in positive
      emotions and decreases in negative emotions. These findings highlight how
      meditation interventions can shift emotion profiles of insecurely attached
      midlife adults who are at heightened risk for late life chronic illnesses.

TI  - Factors associated with relapse and recurrence of major depressive disorder in
      patients starting mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.
PG  - 113-122
LID - 10.1002/da.23220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective for relapse
      prevention in major depressive disorder (MDD). It reduces cognitive reactivity
      (CR) and rumination, and enhances self-compassion and mindfulness. Although
      rumination and mindfulness after MBCT are associated with relapse, the
      association of CR, rumination, self-compassion, and mindfulness with relapse
      before initiation of MBCT has never been investigated. METHODS: Data were drawn
      from two randomized controlled trials, including a total of 282 remitted MDD
      participants (≥3 depressive episodes) who had been using maintenance
      antidepressant medication (mADM) for at least 6 months before baseline. All
      participants were offered MBCT while either their mADM was maintained or
      discontinued after MBCT. CR, rumination, self-compassion, and mindfulness were
      assessed at baseline by self-rated questionnaires and were used in Cox
      proportional hazards regression models to investigate their association with
      relapse. RESULTS: CR and mindfulness were associated with relapse, independent of
      residual symptoms, previous depressive episodes, and mADM-use. Higher CR and
      lower mindfulness increased the risk of relapse. Self-compassion was not
      associated with relapse. For rumination, a significant interaction with mADM-use
      was found. Rumination was associated with relapse in patients who discontinued
      their mADM, while this effect was absent if patients continued mADM. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results show that CR, rumination, and mindfulness are associated with
      relapse in remitted MDD-patients before initiation of MBCT, independent of
      residual symptoms and previous depressive episodes. This information could
      improve decisions in treatment planning in remitted individuals with a history of
      depression.

AB  - Much research has demonstrated the beneficial effects of mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) on psychological and physical health, but it is not known
      whether MBSR may impact cellular aging in healthy populations. Further, little
      research has evaluated MBSR against an active control condition, which precludes
      strong conclusions regarding the unique effects of mindfulness on psychological
      functioning. The present study examined the effects of MBSR versus music
      therapy-based stress reduction (MTSR) on trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and
      several psychological health outcomes, as well as leukocyte telomere length
      (LTL). One hundred and fifty eight Singaporean Chinese adults were recruited and
      randomly assigned to an eight-week MBSR or MTSR course. Participants provided
      blood samples and completed a battery of self-report measures pre- and
      post-intervention. Analyses showed that participants in the MBSR condition
      demonstrated significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms, trait
      mindfulness, and self-compassion compared to the control condition. Treatment
      condition did not predict changes in LTL, anxiety, stress, or happiness, though
      there was a trend for duration of home mindfulness practice to predict increases
      in LTL. Overall, the study demonstrated MBSR's unique effects in reducing
      depressive symptoms. Improvements in trait mindfulness and self-compassion
      correspond with theorized mechanisms of change underlying mindfulness training.
      The lack of intervention effect with regards to LTL suggests that a more
      intensive intervention may be required for mindfulness to exert noticeable impact
      on aging at the cellular level, or that the effect may only emerge over a longer
      term.

TI  - Effectiveness of mindfulness-based supportive psychotherapy on posttraumatic
      growth, resilience, and self-compassion in cancer patients : A pilot study.
PG  - 593-601
LID - 10.1007/s00508-022-02057-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of
      mindfulness-based supportive psychotherapy on posttraumatic growth, resilience,
      and self-compassion of the cancer patients. METHODS: This quasi-experimental
      study was conducted as a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up inquiry with
      a control group. A total of 30 patients who met the inclusion criteria were
      selected through the convenience sampling method out of all patients referred to
      ALA Cancer Prevention and Control Center (MACSA) in Isfahan city, Iran. They were
      randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group
      received mindfulness-based supportive psychotherapy (SP) for 6 sessions of
      90-min, while the control group only received treatment as usual (TAU). Finally,
      both groups were re-evaluated through the post-test and follow-up stages after 3
      months. The research instruments included the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory,
      the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Neff's Self-Compassion Scale. Collected
      data were analyzed using the repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA).
      RESULTS: The results showed that the group supportive psychotherapy significantly
      increased posttraumatic growth (p < 0.05) and resilience (p < 0.05), and improved
      self-compassion (p < 0.05) in the experimental group over the post-test phase. At
      the post-intervention phase, the effect sizes were Cohen's d = 0.72, d = 0.68,
      and d = 0.63 for post-traumatic growth, resilience, and self-compassion,
      respectively. Changes were constantly implemented in the follow-up phase as well.
      CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, mindfulness-based
      supportive psychotherapy could be used along with usual medical treatment in
      order to improve post-traumatic growth, resilience, and self-compassion in cancer
      patients.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Professionals Working in End-of-Life Care: A
      Systematic Review of the Literature.
PG  - 225-238
LID - 10.1177/08258597221100330 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The potential usefulness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) is
      being investigated for healthcare staff burnout and associated problems, but
      empirical research on MBI's for end-of-life (EOL) professionals is still in its
      infancy. The aim of this review is to describe and evaluate the body of
      evidence-based research on the use of MBIs to support the psychological wellbeing
      of professional staff in EOL care settings. Methods: A systematic review of the
      literature was conducted. Database records were extracted from ERIC, PsycInfo,
      EBSCO, PubMed Central (PMC) and Web of Science, using search terms to locate
      peer-reviewed studies on professional (not volunteer) staff in dedicated
      end-of-life settings, administering MBIs not embedded in more general therapeutic
      modalities (such as ACT or DBT). After removing duplicates, 8701 potential
      studies were identified: eliminating those that did not fit the eligibility
      criteria reduced the number of eligible studies to six. Results: A total of six
      empirical studies were identified and further evaluated. Interventions primarily
      focussed on reducing burnout symptoms, increasing self-care and self-compassion,
      and fostering mindfulness. Studies demonstrated very little overlap in treatment,
      methodology and measures. Only one study was a randomised control trial, which on
      application of the 3-item Jadad quality scoring, (evidence of randomisation,
      blinding of researcher to participants' identity and accounts provided of all
      participants), achieved 1 out of 5 possible points. Furthermore, other concerns
      were identified as to the study's methodology. Conclusions: Results of this
      review point to significant gaps in the research on the potential of MBIs to
      improve the wellbeing of EOL professionals.

AB  - This research assesses the relationship between self-compassion and well-being
      following an imagined trauma (i.e., sexual assault) and shows positive outcomes
      from a self-compassion induction. After a pilot study (N = 54) established the
      believability of a sexual assault scenario, the primary study randomly assigned
      female participants (N = 141) to a self-compassion or control condition.
      Participants read educational prompts (self-compassion and verbal learning or
      verbal learning only), completed comprehension questions, read and wrote about a
      hypothetical scenario from a compassionate perspective or generally, and
      completed the trait self-compassion scale. Regression analyses showed trait and
      induced self-compassion predicted less negative outcomes.

TI  - App-Based Mindfulness Meditation for People of Color Who Experience Race-Related
      Stress: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e35196
LID - 10.2196/35196 [doi]
LID - e35196
AB  - BACKGROUND: People of color (POC) who experience race-related stress are at risk
      of developing mental health problems, including high levels of stress, anxiety,
      and depression. Mindfulness meditation may be especially well suited to help POC
      cope, given its emphasis on gaining awareness and acceptance of emotions
      associated with discriminatory treatment. However, mindfulness meditation rarely
      reaches POC, and digital approaches could reduce this treatment gap by addressing
      traditional barriers to care. OBJECTIVE: This study will test the effectiveness
      of a self-directed app-based mindfulness meditation program among POC who
      experience elevated levels of race-related stress. Implementation outcomes such
      as treatment acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction will be examined.
      METHODS: Participants (n=80) will be recruited online by posting recruitment
      materials on social media and sending emails to relevant groups. In-person
      recruitment will consist of posting flyers in communities with significant POC
      representation. Eligible participants will be block randomized to either the
      intervention group (n=40) that will complete a self-directed 4-week mindfulness
      meditation program or a wait-list control condition (n=40) that will receive
      access to the app after study completion. All participants will complete measures
      at baseline, midtreatment, and posttreatment. Primary outcomes include changes in
      stress, anxiety, and depression, and secondary outcomes constitute changes in
      mindfulness, self-compassion, rumination, emotion suppression, and experiential
      avoidance. Exploratory analyses will examine whether changes in the secondary
      outcomes mediate changes in primary outcomes. Finally, treatment acceptability,
      adherence, and satisfaction will be examined descriptively. RESULTS: Recruitment
      began in October 2021. Data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling, a
      statistical methodology that accounts for the dependence among repeated
      observations. Considering attrition issues in self-directed digital interventions
      and their potential effects on statistical significance and treatment effect
      sizes, we will examine data using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to provide
      data on the effectiveness of a self-directed app-based mindfulness meditation
      program for POC recruited based on elevated race-related stress, a high-risk
      population. Similarly, meaningful clinical targets for POC affected by stressors
      related to race will be examined. Findings will provide important information
      regarding whether this type of intervention is an acceptable treatment among
      these marginalized groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05027113;

      for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress: Promoting Adaptive Emotional Regulation and
      Wisdom.
PG  - 648087

AB  - Introduction: Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high
      level of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to find helpful coping
      mechanisms. Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular
      treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress.
      The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness
      meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that
      are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned
      to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone
      intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to
      engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring
      task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression,
      stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and
      subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their
      weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group
      differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case analyses. Results:
      Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled
      trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive
      symptoms (d = -0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate between-group
      differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such that significant
      improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in
      self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small
      between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover,
      a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (d = -0.52) and anxiety
      symptoms (d = -0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. Conclusions:
      Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of
      self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce
      depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive
      restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions.
      As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can
      identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in
      adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater
      self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on
      their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges
      during the pandemic.

TI  - Self-compassion in eating disorders and childhood trauma: A study of
      within-person effects in a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 640-653
LID - 10.1080/10503307.2022.2149363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with eating disorders and childhood trauma have clinical
      presentations that make them less suitable for standard eating disorder
      treatment. This might be due to high levels of shame and self-criticism.
      Self-compassion can be a mechanism of change, especially for patients with eating
      disorders and childhood trauma. METHOD: A total of 130 patients with or without
      childhood trauma were admitted to 13 weeks of inpatient treatment and randomized
      to either compassion-focused therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy.
      Self-compassion and eating disorder symptoms were measured every week. The data
      were analyzed for within-person effects using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: We
      did not find a within-person effect of self-compassion on eating disorder
      symptoms. Rather, the analysis indicated that eating disorder symptoms predict
      self-compassion in the overall sample. However, we found a stronger within-person
      relationship between self-compassion and eating disorder symptoms in patients
      with trauma receiving compassion-focused therapy compared to the remaining
      patients in the study. CONCLUSION: Overall, eating disorder symptoms predicted
      subsequent self-compassion at a within-person level. Patients with trauma in
      compassion-focused therapy demonstrated a stronger relationship between
      self-compassion and eating disorder symptoms. More studies with a cross-lagged
      design are needed to further illuminate self-compassion as a mechanism of change
      for these patients.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
      NCT02649114.

AB  - Many individuals believe that meditation has the capacity to not only alleviate
      mental-illness but to improve prosociality. This article systematically reviewed
      and meta-analysed the effects of meditation interventions on prosociality in
      randomized controlled trials of healthy adults. Five types of social behaviours
      were identified: compassion, empathy, aggression, connectedness and prejudice.
      Although we found a moderate increase in prosociality following meditation,
      further analysis indicated that this effect was qualified by two factors: type of
      prosociality and methodological quality. Meditation interventions had an effect
      on compassion and empathy, but not on aggression, connectedness or prejudice. We
      further found that compassion levels only increased under two conditions: when
      the teacher in the meditation intervention was a co-author in the published
      study; and when the study employed a passive (waiting list) control group but not
      an active one. Contrary to popular beliefs that meditation will lead to prosocial
      changes, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the effects of meditation
      on prosociality were qualified by the type of prosociality and methodological
      quality of the study. We conclude by highlighting a number of biases and
      theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this
      area.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neuroticism, a characteristic associated with increased stress
      vulnerability and the tendency to experience distress, is strongly linked to risk
      of different forms of psychopathology. However, there are few evidence-based
      interventions to target neuroticism. This pilot study investigated the efficacy
      and acceptability of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with an
      online self-help intervention for individuals with high levels of neuroticism.
      The MBCT was modified to address psychological processes that are characteristic
      of neuroticism. METHOD: Participants with high levels of neuroticism were
      randomized to MBCT (n=17) or an online self-help intervention (n=17). Self-report
      questionnaires were administered preintervention and again at 4weeks
      postintervention. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses found that MBCT
      participants had significantly lower levels of neuroticism postintervention than
      the control group. Compared with the control group, the MBCT group also
      experienced significant reductions in rumination and increases in self-compassion
      and decentering, of which the latter two were correlated with reductions in
      neuroticism within the MBCT group. Low drop-out rates, high levels of adherence
      to home practice, and positive feedback from MBCT participants provide
      indications that this intervention may be an acceptable form of treatment for
      individuals who are vulnerable to becoming easily stressed. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT
      specifically modified to target neuroticism-related processes is a promising
      intervention for reducing neuroticism. Results support evidence suggesting
      neuroticism is malleable and amenable to psychological intervention. MBCT for
      neuroticism warrants further investigation in a larger study.

LID - e021941
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Teachers and student teachers in Germany are a high-risk population
      for stress and stress-related mental health problems. This often leads to early
      retirement in subsequent professional life. Various trials have demonstrated
      positive effects of stress prevention training on the perceived stress and
      stress-related symptoms of teachers. Although many studies show positive effects
      of mindfulness-based stress interventions, there is not yet any mindfulness-based
      intervention for teachers or student teachers in Germany. The aim of this trial
      is to evaluate a training that combines mindfulness-based and cognitive
      interventions into one programme, addressing to the specific burdens of student
      teachers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study protocol presents a prospective
      block-randomised controlled trial. Assessment will take place at three time
      points (baseline, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up) for an intervention and
      waiting control group, and at a fourth assessment point for the waiting control
      group after receiving the training. The aim is to evaluate the effects of
      mindfulness-based stress prevention on stress, psychological morbidity, burnout
      and self-efficacy using validated measures. Participants are student teachers
      from German teacher training colleges and participation will be voluntary. The
      targeted total sample size is 96 at 3-month follow-up. The training will comprise
      three 4-hour sessions conducted every 2 weeks. The control group will participate
      in the training after the 3-month follow-up. The allotment will be randomised
      with a stratified allocation ratio by gender. After descriptive statistics have
      been evaluated, inferential statistical analysis will be conducted using repeated
      measures analysis of variance with interactions between time and group. Effect
      sizes will be calculated using partial η(2) values. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:
      Results will be disseminated at conferences, in specialist magazines and through
      peer-reviewed publications. The trial has been approved by the ethics review
      board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference
      number 837.192.16 (10511). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00010897.

TI  - Efficacy of a mindfulness and compassion-based intervention in psychotherapists
      and their patients: Empathy, symptomatology, and mechanisms of change in a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 182-193
LID - 10.1037/pst0000467 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, mindfulness and compassion-based interventions (MCBI) have been
      found to beneficially influence the acquisition of essential skills in
      psychotherapy and are a promising way to improve relationships with patients. In
      this regard, new studies are needed to evaluate the effects of MCBI on
      psychotherapists and their patients and to analyze the influence of these effects
      on the processes and outcomes of psychotherapy. In this randomized controlled
      trial, we evaluate the efficacy of an MCBI in psychotherapists' mindfulness
      skills and self-reported empathy, as well as its indirect effect on patients
      (patient-reported psychotherapists' empathy, therapeutic bond, and
      symptomatology). Finally, we present a multilevel structural equation model
      (MSEM) to analyze the relationship between these variables in psychotherapists
      and their patients. A group of psychotherapists (N = 63) were randomized to an
      MCBI or an active control group (empathy diary). We assessed psychotherapists and
      their patients (N = 121) before and after the MCBI and at follow-up evaluation.
      Psychotherapists' results showed an increase in psychotherapeutic mindfulness
      skills (PMS) after the MCBI and at follow-up, whereas self-reported empathy
      improved at follow-up. Patients' results showed an improvement in perceived
      empathy, therapeutic bond, and symptomatology after the MCBI. The improvements in
      symptomatology were maintained for somatization and anxiety at follow-up.
      According to the MSEM, the increase in PMS is related to an increase in
      patient-reported psychotherapists' empathy, which produces an improvement in
      therapeutic bond and their symptomatology. These results support the benefits of
      introducing MCBI in psychotherapists' training to improve the psychotherapy
      outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Designing Ruby: Protocol for a 2-Arm, Brief, Digital Randomized Controlled Trial
      for Internalized Weight Bias.
PG  - e31307
LID - 10.2196/31307 [doi]
LID - e31307
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight bias internalization, also known as weight self-stigma, is a
      serious health concern for individuals with higher body weight. Weight bias
      internalization is associated with the greater avoidance of health care and
      health-promoting activities, disordered eating, social isolation, and weight
      gain. Elevated weight bias internalization has been associated with low
      self-compassion, yet few investigations have explored self-compassion as a
      potential mechanism for reducing internalized weight bias. OBJECTIVE: Ruby is a
      2-arm randomized controlled trial that was designed to test the efficacy of a
      4-week digital self-compassion intervention to reduce internalized weight bias
      compared with a wait-list control. METHODS: Adults with elevated internalized
      weight bias and a BMI of >30 kg/m(2) (N=80) were recruited. Ruby is a standalone
      digital trial that will be delivered entirely via a smartphone and will involve
      web-based data collection and text messages. The intervention content will
      include psychoeducation and daily mindfulness practices with a focus on
      self-compassion and body concerns. We will use intent-to-treat analyses to
      examine changes in weight bias internalization throughout time by treatment arm.
      The analyses will be conducted by using one-way analysis of covariance models and
      linear mixed models. RESULTS: The protocol was designed in May 2020 and approved
      in December 2020. Data collection is currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: Ruby will
      be the first digital standalone, self-compassion-based intervention designed to
      reduce internalized weight bias. Owing to its standalone digital delivery, Ruby
      may be a highly scalable treatment for internalized weight bias that can be
      delivered on its own or combined with other treatments. We expect Ruby to be
      accessible to many, as participants can access the digital intervention at times
      of the day that are the most convenient in their schedule and are not burdened by
      in-person time commitments, which can be a barrier for participants with
      competing demands on their time and resources. If efficacious, Ruby will be
      poised to expand a burgeoning body of literature related to psychological
      intervention in this area. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04678973;

TI  - Increasing autobiographical memory specificity: Using kindness meditation to
      impact features of memory retrieval.
PG  - e0287007
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0287007 [doi]
LID - e0287007
AB  - Individuals with a history of depression have an increased risk for future
      episodes. This risk has been linked with impaired features of autobiographical
      memory retrieval that remain when depressive symptoms abate, including memory
      specificity, remoteness, valence, and vantage perspective. Rumination has been
      shown to influence these impairments and can be reduced via compassion training.
      We therefore investigated the effects of a self-compassion meditation on
      autobiographical memory retrieval in remitted depression. Baseline data were
      collected (n = 50) using an extended version of the Autobiographical Memory Test
      where participants with remitted depression retrieved specific memories from a
      remote time period (10 cues) and from any time period (10 cues). Valence and
      vantage perspective were rated. Participants were then randomly allocated to a
      self-compassion meditation or (control) colouring intervention group. Baseline
      measures were reassessed after four weeks of the intervention. Results revealed
      increased retrieval of specific memories in the self-compassion group in
      comparison to the colouring group, and an increase in positive and field memories
      across groups while no remoteness changes were observed. This self-compassion
      meditation demonstrated initial promise as an intervention to influence features
      of autobiographical memory retrieval in remitted depression. Improvements were
      shown in specificity, valence, and vantage perspective. Addressing these features
      with this type of intervention might reduce a cognitive vulnerability to
      depression and should be investigated in future studies.

TI  - Intensive meditation training influences emotional responses to suffering.
PG  - 775-90
LID - 10.1037/emo0000080 [doi]
AB  - Meditation practices purportedly help people develop focused and sustained
      attention, cultivate feelings of compassionate concern for self and others, and
      strengthen motivation to help others who are in need. We examined the impact of 3
      months of intensive meditative training on emotional responses to scenes of human
      suffering. Sixty participants were assigned randomly to either a 3-month
      intensive meditation retreat or a wait-list control group. Training consisted of
      daily practice in techniques designed to improve attention and enhance
      compassionate regard for others. Participants viewed film scenes depicting human
      suffering at pre- and posttraining laboratory assessments, during which both
      facial and subjective measures of emotion were collected. At post-assessment,
      training group participants were more likely than controls to show facial
      displays of sadness. Trainees also showed fewer facial displays of rejection
      emotions (anger, contempt, disgust). The groups did not differ on the likelihood
      or frequency of showing these emotions prior to training. Self-reported
      sympathy--but not sadness or distress--predicted sad behavior and inversely
      predicted displays of rejection emotions in trainees only. These results suggest
      that intensive meditation training encourages emotional responses to suffering
      characterized by enhanced sympathetic concern for, and reduced aversion to, the
      suffering of others.

TI  - Immediate impact of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) among women with
      breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 331
LID - 10.1186/s12905-023-02486-x [doi]
LID - 331
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may have positive
      physiological and psychological benefits for breast cancer survivors. However,
      few studies involved a combination of the relevant literatures to confirm the
      effects. METHODS: Our study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
      non-RCTs comparing interventions of MBCT and control protocols for alleviation of
      symptoms among breast cancer survivors. We calculated pooled mean differences
      (MDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
      by using random effects models to estimate summary effect sizes. RESULTS:
      Thirteen trials with 20-245 participants were considered in our studies; for the
      meta-analysis, 11 of these studies were eligible for assessment. The pooled
      meta-analysis results revealed that at the end of the MBCT intervention,
      participants' anxiety (SMD, - 0.70; 95% CI, - 1.26 to - 0.13; I(2) = 69%), pain
      (SMD, - 0.64; 95% CI, - 0.92 to - 0.37; I(2) = 0%), and depression (SMD, - 0.65;
      95% CI, - 1.14 to - 0.17; I(2) = 75%) levels significantly decreased, and their
      mindfulness (MD, 8.83; 95% CI, 3.88 to 13.78; I(2) = 68%) levels significantly
      increased. CONCLUSION: The MBCT may be associated with improved pain, anxiety,
      depression, and mindfulness. However, the quantitative analysis pointed to an
      inconclusive result due to moderate to high levels of heterogeneity among
      indicator of anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. Future work requires more
      studies to better elucidate the clinical significance of this possible
      association. The results suggest that MBCT is highly beneficial as an
      intervention for patients who have received treatment for breast cancer.

PG  - 443-450
LID - 10.1111/sjop.12385 [doi]
AB  - The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of a two-week
      self-compassion course on healthy self-regulation (personal growth self-efficacy
      and healthy impulse control) and unhealthy self-regulation (self-judgment and
      habitual negative self-directed thinking) in university students. We also
      examined the effects on self-compassion, anxiety and depression. Students (N =
      158, 85% women, mean age = 25 years) were randomized to an intervention group and
      a waiting-list control group in a multi-baseline randomized control trial.
      Healthy self-control was measured by the Personal Growth Initiative Scale (PGIS)
      and the Self-Control Scale; unhealthy self-control was measured by the
      Non-judgement subscale from the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (reversed)
      and the Habit Index of Negative Thinking (HINT). Secondary outcomes were measured
      by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-trait), the Major Depression Inventory
      (MDI), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). A 2 × 3 repeated measures analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) showed gains for the intervention-group in personal growth
      self-efficacy and healthy impulse-control and reductions in self-judgment and
      habitual negative self-directed thinking, as well as increases in self-compassion
      and reductions in anxiety and depression. After all participants had completed
      the course, the groups were combined and repeated measures ANOVAs showed that
      changes remained at six-month follow-up for personal growth self-efficacy,
      self-judgment and habitual negative self-directed thinking; as well as for
      self-compassion, anxiety and depression. Concluding, a short self-compassion
      course seems an effective method of increasing self-compassion and perceived
      control over one's life for university students, as well as increasing mental
      health.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based intervention on quality of life and poststroke
      depression in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in China.
PG  - 572-580

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a devastating disease
      that can lead to poststroke depression (PSD) and greatest impact on the quality
      of life (QOL) of patients. Mindfulness meditation was viewed as one of the
      effective ways to reduce PSD in patients with cancer. The present study tried to
      investigate whether mindfulness meditation has potential benefits in PSD and QOL
      for sICH patients in China. METHODS: Two hundred and two patients in West China
      Hospital, Sichuan University, enrolled from January 2017 to December 2018 were
      included in a randomized controlled trial. After removing missing values, there
      were 67 in control group and 67 in intervention group. Patients in intervention
      group received 2-month mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and patients in
      control group received stress management education (ie, an active control).
      RESULTS: The results suggested that the significant differences of depression,
      trait mindfulness, social well-being, emotional well-being, and total score of
      QOL were found in intervention group from time 1 to time 2. Physical well-being
      and the score of NIH stroke scale experienced significant changes in both control
      group and intervention group over time. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based
      intervention has positive effects on sICH patients' depression, social
      well-being, and emotional well-being. However, the change of trait mindfulness
      over time could not explain these positive effects. Future studies could explore
      the mechanism of mindfulness-based intervention on sICH patients' depression and
      QOL and clarify the boundaries of the positive effects of mindfulness-based
      intervention.
