TI  - Moving 2 Mindful (M2M) study protocol: testing a mindfulness group plus 
      ecological momentary intervention to decrease stress and anxiety in adolescents 
      from high-conflict homes with a mixed-method longitudinal design.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interparental conflict exposure places adolescents at risk for 
      problems with stress and anxiety; existing prevention/intervention strategies 
      focus on reducing interparental conflict. Mindfulness-based programmes may be a 
      promising treatment strategy for this population, but studies have not yet tested 
      whether they are effective in this high-conflict context. In addition, evidence 
      suggests that extensions to traditional treatments, such as delivering components 
      in daily life that are tailored to moments of need, can increase treatment 
      efficacy, particularly when combined with in-person treatments and particularly 
      for adolescents. However, there are no such extensions to mindfulness 
      interventions available. The Moving 2 Mindful study aims to (1) develop an 
      ecological momentary intervention (EMI) supplement to Learning to BREATHE (L2B), 
      an evidence-based mindfulness intervention for adolescents; (2) refine the EMI 
      programme and determine the best delivery plan; (3) examine the feasibility and 
      acceptability of L2B Plus (L2B plus the developed supplement) and (4) examine the 
      potential for L2B Plus to reduce stress and anxiety for adolescents from 
      high-conflict homes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Moving 2 Mindful study proposes a 
      mixed-methods approach to developing and refining a multimethod adaptive 
      supplement to L2B. Feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness will be 
      tested in a sample of 38 families, who will be randomly assigned to receive L2B 
      Plus or an active health and wellness control condition and followed until 
      3 months postintervention. A range of psychosocial and physiological factors will 
      be assessed at multiple time points. This study is registered with 
      clinicaltrials.gov (ID NCT03869749; pre-results). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      Institutional Review Board at Colorado State University has approved this study. 
      Findings will be disseminated in scientific journals and conferences, whether 
      they are positive, negative or inconclusive.

TI  - Impact of Meditation on Mental Health Outcomes of Female Trauma Survivors of 
      Interpersonal Violence With Co-Occurring Disorders: A Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - 2139-2165
LID - 10.1177/0886260515591277 [doi]
AB  - This study was a randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of 
      meditation practice on the mental health outcomes of female trauma survivors of 
      interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders. Sixty-three female trauma 
      survivors were randomly assigned to the meditation condition and the control 
      condition. Treatment conditions consisted of a 6-week meditation curriculum that 
      was influenced by Tibetan meditation tradition and focused on breathing, loving 
      kindness, and compassion meditation. Clients in the meditation condition made 
      significant changes in mental health symptoms ( t = 5.252, df = 31, p = .000) and 
      trauma symptoms ( t = 6.009, df = 31, p = .000) from pre-treatment to 
      post-treatment, whereas non-significant changes were observed among the control 
      condition clients. There were significant group differences between clients in 
      the meditation condition and in the control condition on their mental health 
      symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.438, p = .001, and trauma symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.395, p 
      = .001, with a generally large effect size of eta squared .127 and .146, 
      respectively. In addition, significantly more clients in the meditation condition 
      achieved reliable change in mental health symptoms (35.5% vs. 8.3%) and trauma 
      symptoms (42.3% vs. 4.8%) than clients in the control condition. Significance of 
      the study is discussed with respect to the empirical evidence of meditation 
      practice as a complementary behavioral intervention for treating female trauma 
      survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders.

TI  - Teachers' stress and training in a school-based mindfulness program: 
      Implementation results from a cluster randomized controlled trial.

AB  - School-based mindfulness trainings (SBMT) are a contemporary approach for 
      intervening to promote students' social and emotional skills and well-being. 
      Despite evidence from the larger field of evidence-based social and emotional 
      learning programs demonstrating the importance of high-quality implementation, 
      few studies have investigated factors impacting the implementation of SBMTs, 
      particularly teacher-level influences. The present study addressed this issue by 
      investigating whether teachers' stress, trust in their fellow teachers and 
      principal, and expectations about the program at baseline predicted the quality 
      of their implementation of a SBMT for students. In addition, we examined whether 
      teachers' stress at baseline moderated the effect of training condition on 
      implementation quality. Implementation quality was assessed via observations and 
      teacher self-reports. Results from a sample of British secondary (middle-high) 
      school educators (N = 81) indicated that teachers who felt more supported by 
      their principals at baseline were later observed to implement the SBMT with 
      greater quality, whereas teachers who had more positive expectations about the 
      program felt more confident teaching the course in the future. Teachers' baseline 
      stress moderated the effect of training condition on all measures of 
      implementation quality; among teachers experiencing high stress at baseline, more 
      intensive training led to higher quality implementation. Implications for 
      practitioners and prevention researchers are discussed.

TI  - Face-to-Face and Internet-Based Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Compared With 
      Treatment as Usual in Reducing Psychological Distress in Patients With Cancer: A 
      Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2413-2421
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.5669 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to alleviate 
      psychological distress in patients with cancer. However, patients experience 
      barriers to participating in face-to-face MBCT. Individual Internet-based MBCT 
      (eMBCT) could be an alternative. The study aim was to compare MBCT and eMBCT with 
      treatment as usual (TAU) for psychological distress in patients with cancer. 
      Patients and Methods We obtained ethical and safety approval to include 245 
      patients with cancer with psychological distress (≥ 11 on the Hospital Anxiety 
      and Depression Scale) in the study. They were randomly allocated to MBCT (n = 
      77), eMBCT (n = 90), or TAU (n = 78). Patients completed baseline (T0) and 
      postintervention (T1) assessments. The primary outcome was psychological distress 
      on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes were psychiatric 
      diagnosis, fear of cancer recurrence, rumination, health-related quality of life, 
      mindfulness skills, and positive mental health. Continuous outcomes were analyzed 
      using linear mixed modeling on the intention-to-treat sample. Because both 
      interventions were compared with TAU, the type I error rate was set at P < .025. 
      Results Compared with TAU, patients reported significantly less psychological 
      distress after both MBCT (Cohen's d, .45; P < .001) and eMBCT (Cohen's d, .71; P 
      < .001) . In addition, post-treatment prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was 
      lower with both MBCT (33% improvement; P = .030) and eMBCT (29% improvement; P = 
      .076) in comparison with TAU (16%), but these changes were not statistically 
      significant. Both interventions reduced fear of cancer recurrence and rumination, 
      and increased mental health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and 
      positive mental health compared with TAU (all Ps < .025). Physical health-related 
      quality of life did not improve ( P = .343). Conclusion Compared with TAU, MBCT 
      and eMBCT were similarly effective in reducing psychological distress in a sample 
      of distressed heterogeneous patients with cancer.

TI  - Mindfulness as a complementary intervention in the treatment of overweight and 
      obesity in primary health care: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 277

LID - 277
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has been applied in the United States and Europe to 
      improve physical and psychological health; however, little is known about its 
      feasibility and efficacy in a Brazilian population. Mindfulness may also be 
      relevant in tackling obesity and eating disorders by decreasing binge eating 
      episodes-partly responsible for weight regain for a large number of people-and 
      increasing awareness of emotional and other triggers for overeating. The aim of 
      the present study protocol is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and 
      efficacy of two mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) addressing overweight and 
      obesity in primary care patients: a general programme called Mindfulness-Based 
      Health Promotion and a targeted mindful eating protocol called Mindfulness-Based 
      Eating Awareness Training. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial will be 
      conducted to compare treatment as usual separately in primary care with both 
      programmes (health promotion and mindful eating) added to treatment as usual. Two 
      hundred forty adult women with overweight and obesity will be enrolled. The 
      primary outcome will be an assessment of improvement in eating behaviour. 
      Secondary outcomes will be (1) biochemical control; (2) anthropometric 
      parameters, body composition, dietary intake and basal metabolism; and (3) levels 
      of mindfulness, stress, depression, self-compassion and anxiety. At the end of 
      each intervention, a focus group will be held to assess the programme's impact on 
      the participants' lives, diet and health. A feasibility study on access to 
      benefits from and importance of MBIs at primary care facilities will be conducted 
      among primary care health care professionals and participants. Monthly 
      maintenance sessions lasting at least 1 hour will be offered, according to each 
      protocol, during the 3-month follow-up periods. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial 
      will result in more effective mindfulness-based interventions as a complementary 
      treatment in primary care for people with overweight and obesity. If the findings 
      of this study confirm the effectiveness of mindfulness programmes in this 
      population, it will be possible to improve quality of life and health while 
      optimising public resources and reaching a greater number of people. In addition, 
      on the basis of the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing this 
      intervention in primary care facilities, we expect to be able to suggest the 
      intervention for incorporation into public policy. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Yoga is an embodying activity that promotes body awareness, body connection, body 
      responsiveness, and appreciation of body functionality, and it therefore may be a 
      beneficial school-based intervention for children's body image. The present study 
      examined the impact of a 4-week yoga intervention on pre-adolescent girls' and 
      boys' body image (body appreciation, body esteem, and body surveillance) and mood 
      (positive and negative affect) 1-week post-intervention and at 6-week follow-up. 
      British children (N = 344; 54.4% female) aged 9-11 years were recruited from four 
      schools, two of which were randomly assigned to the yoga intervention and two to 
      a physical education control condition. Overall, girls reported greater body 
      image concern and negative mood than boys. Unexpectedly, both groups reported 
      increased body appreciation, body esteem, and positive mood, and decreased body 
      surveillance and negative affect from baseline to post-intervention and/or 
      follow-up. Both girls and boys in the yoga intervention evaluated the sessions 
      very favourably; the majority desired to participate in more lessons. Potential 
      explanations for these findings are discussed.

TI  - Preliminary Investigation of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Social Anxiety 
      Disorder That Integrates Compassion Meditation and Mindful Exposure.
PG  - 363-74
LID - 10.1089/acm.2015.0108 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the feasibility and initial efficacy of a 
      12-week group mindfulness-based intervention tailored for persons with social 
      anxiety disorder (MBI-SAD). The intervention includes elements of the standard 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction program, explicit training in self-compassion 
      aimed at cultivating a more accepting and kinder stance toward oneself, and use 
      of exposure procedures to help participants practice responding mindfully to 
      internal experiences evoked by feared social situations. METHODS: Participants 
      were randomly assigned to the MBI-SAD (n = 21) or a waitlist (WL) (n = 18) 
      control group. Feasibility was assessed by the number of participants who 
      completed at least 75% of the 12 weekly group sessions. Primary efficacy outcomes 
      were clinician- and self-rated measures of social anxiety. Other outcomes 
      included clinician ratings of illness severity and self-rated depression, social 
      adjustment, mindfulness, and self-compassion. RESULTS: The MBI-SAD was acceptable 
      and feasible, with 81% of participants attending at least 75% of sessions. The 
      MBI-SAD fared better than WL in improving social anxiety symptom severity 
      (p ≤ 0.0001), depression (p ≤ 0.05), and social adjustment (p ≤ 0.05). The 
      intervention also enhanced self-compassion (p ≤ 0.05), and facets of mindfulness 
      (observe and aware; p ≤ .05). MBI-SAD treatment gains were maintained at 3-month 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that an MBI that 
      integrates explicit training in self-compassion and mindful exposure is a 
      feasible and promising intervention for social anxiety disorder. The next step is 
      to compare the MBI-SAD to the gold standard of cognitive-behavior therapy to 
      determine equivalence or noninferiority and to explore mediators and moderators 
      of treatment outcome.

PG  - 922

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epilepsy extends far beyond seizures; up to 80% of children with 
      epilepsy (CWE) may have comorbid cognitive or mental health problems, and up to 
      50% of parents of CWE are at risk for major depression. Past research has also 
      shown that family environment has a greater influence on children's and parents' 
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health than epilepsy-related 
      factors. There is a pressing need for low-cost, innovative interventions to 
      improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents. The aim of this 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether an interactive online 
      mindfulness-based intervention program, Making Mindfulness Matter (M3), can be 
      feasibly implemented and whether it positively affects CWE's and parents' HRQOL 
      and mental health (specifically, stress, behavioral, depressive, and anxiety 
      symptoms). METHODS: This parallel RCT was planned to recruit 100 child-parent 
      dyads to be randomized 1:1 to the 8-week intervention or waitlist control and 
      followed over 20 weeks. The intervention, M3, will be delivered online and 
      separately to parents and children (ages 4-10 years) in groups of 4-8 by 
      non-clinician staff of a local community epilepsy agency. The intervention 
      incorporates mindful awareness, social-emotional learning skills, and positive 
      psychology. It is modeled after the validated school-based MindUP program and 
      adapted for provision online and to include a parent component. DISCUSSION: This 
      RCT will determine whether this online mindfulness-based intervention is feasible 
      and effective for CWE and their parents. The proposed intervention may be an 
      ideal vector to significantly improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their 
      parents given its low cost and implementation by community epilepsy agencies.

TI  - Cognitively-Based Compassion Training versus cancer health education to improve 
      health-related quality of life in survivors of solid tumor cancers and their 
      informal caregivers: study protocol for a randomized controlled pilot trial.
PG  - 247

LID - 247
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors and their informal caregivers (family members, close 
      friends) often experience significant impairments in health-related quality of 
      life (HRQOL), including disruptions in psychological, physical, social, and 
      spiritual well-being both during and after primary cancer treatment. The purpose 
      of this in-progress pilot trial is to determine acceptability and preliminary 
      efficacy (as reflected by effect sizes) of CBCT® (Cognitively-Based Compassion 
      Training) compared with a cancer health education (CHE) attention control to 
      improve the primary outcome of depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes of 
      other HRQOL domains (e.g., anxiety, fatigue), biomarkers of inflammation and 
      diurnal cortisol rhythm, and healthcare utilization-related outcomes in both 
      cancer survivors and informal caregivers. METHODS: Forty dyads consisting of 
      solid tumor survivors who have completed primary treatments (chemotherapy, 
      radiation, surgery) and their informal caregivers, with at least one dyad member 
      with ≥ mild depressive symptoms or anxiety, will be recruited from Tucson, 
      Arizona, USA. Survivor-caregiver dyads will be randomized together to complete 
      either CBCT or CHE. CBCT is a manualized, 8-week, group meditation-based 
      intervention that starts with attention and mindfulness and builds to 
      contemplative practices aimed at cultivating compassion to the self and others. 
      The goal of CBCT is to challenge unexamined assumptions about feelings and 
      behaviors, with a focus on generating spontaneous self-compassion and increased 
      empathic responsiveness and compassion for others. CHE is an 8-week, manualized 
      group intervention that provides cancer-specific education on various topics 
      (e.g., cancer advocacy, survivorship wellness). Patient-reported HRQOL outcomes 
      will be assessed before, immediately after (week 9), and 1 month after CBCT or 
      CHE (week 13). At the same time points, stress-related biomarkers of inflammation 
      (e.g., plasma interleukin-6) and saliva cortisol relevant for survivor and 
      informal caregiver wellness and healthcare utilization will be measured. 
      DISCUSSION: If CBCT shows acceptability, a larger trial will be warranted and 
      appropriately powered to formally test the efficacy of this dyadic intervention. 
      Interventions such as CBCT directed toward both survivors and caregivers may 
      eventually fill a gap in supportive oncology care programs to improve HRQOL and 
      healthcare utilization in both dyad members. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03459781 . Prospectively registered on 9 March 2018.

TI  - Evaluation of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for life and a cognitive 
      behavioural therapy stress-management workshop to improve healthcare staff 
      stress: study protocol for two randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 209
LID - 10.1186/s13063-018-2547-1 [doi]
LID - 209
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers experience higher levels of work-related stress 
      and higher rates of sickness absence than workers in other sectors. Psychological 
      approaches have potential in providing healthcare workers with the knowledge and 
      skills to recognise stress and to manage stress effectively. The strongest 
      evidence for effectiveness in reducing stress in the workplace is for 
      stress-management courses based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles 
      and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). However, research examining effects 
      of these interventions on sickness absence (an objective indicator of stress) and 
      compassion for others (an indicator of patient care) is limited, as is research 
      on brief CBT stress-management courses (which may be more widely accessible) and 
      on MBIs adapted for workplace settings. METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol is for two 
      randomised controlled trials with participant preference between the two trials 
      and 1:1 allocation to intervention or wait-list within the preferred choice. The 
      first trial is examining a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and the second 
      trial an 8-session Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Life (MBCT-L) course, 
      with both trials comparing intervention to wait-list. The primary outcome for 
      both trials is stress post-intervention with secondary outcomes being sickness 
      absence, compassion for others, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, wellbeing, 
      work-related burnout, self-compassion, presenteeism, and mindfulness (MBCT-L 
      only). Both trials aim to recruit 234 staff working in the National Health 
      Service in the UK. DISCUSSION: This trial will examine whether a one-day CBT 
      stress-management workshop and an 8-session MBCT-L course are effective at 
      reducing healthcare staff stress and other mental health outcomes compared to 
      wait-list, and, whether these interventions are effective at reducing sickness 
      absence and presenteeism and at enhancing wellbeing, self-compassion, mindfulness 
      and compassion for others. Findings will help inform approaches offered to reduce 
      healthcare staff stress and other key variables. A note of caution is that 
      individual-level approaches should only be part of the solution to reducing 
      healthcare staff stress within a broader focus on organisational-level 
      interventions and support. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN11723441 .

TI  - A mindfulness and compassion-based program applied to pregnant women and their 
      partners to decrease depression symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum: study 
      protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 654

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of great change for 
      women and their partners, often bringing substantial challenges and stress. 
      Approximately 10%-20% of women suffer from mood disorders such as depression in 
      the perinatal period. There are risks involved in using psychopharmacological 
      interventions to treat perinatal depression. Mindfulness and compassion-based 
      educational programs could be efficacious and cost-effective options for the 
      prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders. The aim of this study is to 
      assess the efficacy of an adapted Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting 
      (MBCP) program that includes compassion training for pregnant women in primary 
      care (PC) settings in the Spanish National Health System to decrease perinatal 
      depression. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be 
      conducted. Participants will be pregnant women (n = 122) and their partners who 
      wish to participate. They will be enrolled and assessed in PC settings and 
      randomly assigned to either: (1) an adapted MBCP educational program tailored to 
      the Spanish National Health System + treatment as usual (TAU); or (2) TAU only. 
      The main outcome to be assessed will be depression, evaluated with the Edinburgh 
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Secondary outcomes will include self-reported 
      measures of perceived stress, affects, mindfulness, self-compassion, maternal 
      self-efficacy, and use of health and social services. Patients will be assessed 
      at four timepoints: baseline; post-treatment; and at three and six months after 
      childbirth. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be carried out 
      using linear regression mixed models. Effect sizes will be estimated using 
      Cohen's d. DISCUSSION: Perinatal depression is a significant health problem. An 
      effective and low-cost childbirth education program that incorporates mindfulness 
      and compassion practices may be a beneficial preventive complementary healthcare 
      modality for expectant women and their partners. This study will be the first 
      multicenter RCT in Spanish PC settings using adapted MBCP and compassion 
      practices to reduce symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum 
      period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03247491. Registered on 31

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a medically unexplained 
      condition characterized by symptoms from multiple organ systems following the 
      perception of common odorants. The condition can cause severe functional 
      impairment for afflicted individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for individuals with MCS. 
      METHODS: The intention-to-treat sample (ITT) included 69 individuals who had been 
      randomized to either MBCT or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome 
      measure was the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI), 
      which measures the following aspects of MCS: impact of MCS on daily life, 
      symptoms, and reactions following chemical exposures. Secondary outcome measures 
      included the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) and the anxiety and 
      depression subscales of the symptom checklist 92 (SCL-92). Participants were 
      assessed at baseline and post treatment, and at follow-up periods of 6- and 
      12-months. RESULTS: We found no effect of MBCT on the primary outcome, nor did we 
      find an effect on levels of depression or anxiety. We did, however, find positive 
      changes in illness perceptions, which were sustained at 12-month follow-up. 
      Dropout rates were low, suggesting MBCT was well received and regarded as an 
      acceptable intervention by individuals with MCS. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these 
      results suggest that MBCT does not change overall illness status in individuals 
      with MCS, but that MBCT positively changes emotional and cognitive 
      representations. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.

TI  - The Effect of a Mindful Self-Compassion Intervention on Burden, Express Emotion 
      and Mental Well-Being in Family Caregivers of Patients with Schizophrenia: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 997-1005
LID - 10.1007/s10597-024-01253-y [doi]
AB  - The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the impact of a 
      mindful self-compassion intervention on burden, express emotion, and mental 
      well-being in family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. Standardized 
      measures, including the ZARIT Caregiving Burden Scale, Expressed Emotion Scale 
      and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, were administered at baseline, 
      post-intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted to assess differences 
      between the two groups. Significant reductions in caregiver burden, expressed 
      emotion, and enhanced mental well-being in the intervention group compared to the 
      control group at post-intervention. The results of this randomized controlled 
      trial indicate that the mindful self-compassion intervention significantly 
      reduces caregiver burden, expressed emotion, and improves mental well-being in 
      family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia. These findings underscore the 
      potential utility of mindful self-compassion interventions as effective support 
      for this population, highlighting the importance of integrating such 
      interventions into caregiver support programs.

TI  - Preliminary efficacy of a lovingkindness meditation intervention for patients 
      undergoing biopsy and breast cancer surgery: A randomized controlled pilot study.
PG  - 3583-3592
LID - 10.1007/s00520-019-4657-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite more women undergoing treatment for breast cancer and increased 
      survival rates, many women suffer from anxiety and physical symptoms (e.g., pain, 
      fatigue) surrounding diagnosis and surgery. Research investigating the efficacy 
      of psychosocial interventions for breast cancer patients during this period is 
      limited. This randomized controlled pilot study examined the effect of a brief 
      lovingkindness meditation intervention on these key outcomes. METHODS: 
      Participants were 60 women who underwent core needle breast biopsy, received an 
      abnormal biopsy result, and underwent breast surgery (White = 73.6%; African 
      American = 22.6%; Asian American = 3.8%; Age M = 56). Participants were randomly 
      assigned to one of three treatment conditions at breast biopsy: (1) 
      lovingkindness meditation, (2) music, and (3) usual care. Assessments of anxiety, 
      pain, fatigue, physiologic reactivity, and self-compassion occurred prior to 
      patients' biopsy, following biopsy, 1 week after receipt of biopsy results, and 
      1 week following breast surgery. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling analyses 
      demonstrated that lovingkindness meditation significantly improved pain 
      (p = 0.02), self-compassion (p = 0.004), and heart rate (p = 0.02) over time 
      compared to control conditions. There was a trend for anxiety (p = 0.05). Music 
      significantly improved pain (p = 0.04) compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a 
      lovingkindness meditation intervention for breast cancer patients during the 
      diagnostic and surgical period. Improving psychological and physical well-being 
      during this time frame has the potential to improve longer-term health outcomes 
      during adjuvant treatment and survivorship. Interventions that cultivate positive 
      adjustment during the diagnostic and surgical period of breast cancer are an 
      important area of future research.

TI  - Trial Protocol: The use of mindfulness-based intervention for improving bracing 
      compliance for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients: protocol for a 
      randomised, controlled trial.
PG  - 193
LID - S1836-9553(18)30042-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jphys.2018.02.019 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most prevalent 
      deforming orthopaedic condition; it causes significant disability when spinal 
      curves progress beyond 45deg. Bracing is the primary treatment prescribed for 
      adolescents with an immature skeleton who have spinal curves between 25 and 
      45deg. New evidence suggests that compliance with bracing significantly decreases 
      the progression of high-risk curves to the threshold for surgery. Nonetheless, 
      bracing is a stressful experience. Therefore, interventions that mediate 
      health-related quality of life for AIS patients are of great interest. In the 
      past few decades, numerous studies have documented the benefits of mindfulness 
      training on chronic pain, stress management, anxiety and emotional disorders. 
      Mindfulness might additionally provide AIS patients with psychosocial support. 
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS: This study will investigate the effects of a 
      mindfulness-based intervention on bracing compliance and quality of life among 
      AIS patients with poor bracing compliance. The study also plans to evaluate if 
      the mindfulness-based intervention effect is sustained after the intervention 
      period. The potential mechanism by which mindfulness affects bracing compliance 
      will be explored. DESIGN: Single-blind, two-arm, randomised, controlled trial. 
      PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study will recruit 120 AIS patients aged between 10 
      and 15 years with non-satisfactory bracing compliance. Patients who have 
      previously practised or are currently practising meditation or mindful yoga or 
      who cannot finish the whole intervention will be excluded. The study will take 
      place at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care building. 
      INTERVENTION: Patients in the mindfulness-based intervention group will join 
      weekly sessions for 8 weeks. This program is a short version of a 
      mindfulness-based stress relaxation program to address the specific issues of AIS 
      patients. Two to three experienced instructors will deliver the program. CONTROL: 
      Control group patients will participate in an 8-week physiotherapy exercise 
      program as recommended in the International Scientific Society on Scoliosis 
      Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) 2011 guideline. MEASUREMENTS: 
      The primary outcome is the 6-month post-intervention total score of bracing 
      compliance. Secondary measures are non-bracing-specific quality of life, 
      bracing-specific quality of life, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindful 
      awareness and acceptance, self-efficacy, perception of stress, and general 
      measure of health outcome. PROCEDURE: 120 participants will be assigned to either 
      an intervention or control arm by simple randomisation, and the randomisation 
      result will only be revealed once participants have confirmed availability to 
      attend intervention classes. Clinicians of the scoliosis clinic and research 
      staff will be blinded to the treatment allocation. ANALYSIS: ANCOVA will be 
      conducted to compare the effect of mindfulness-based intervention versus 
      physiotherapy exercise on the outcome measures. To investigate significant change 
      over time, linear mixed models analyses will be conducted following the 
      intention-to-treat principle. The R-package lavaan will be used to conduct 
      structural equation modelling to study the potential mechanism of mindfulness. 
      DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This will be the first psychosocial intervention study 
      conducted on braced AIS patients with the aim of improving patients' bracing 
      compliance and quality of life. The results from this study will potentially 
      carry significant impact on future AIS treatment by emphasising psychosocial care 
      for braced AIS patients.

TI  - The moderation of Mindfulness-based stress reduction effects by trait 
      mindfulness: results from a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 267-77
LID - 10.1002/jclp.20761 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has shown effectiveness for a variety 
      of mental health conditions. However, it is not known for whom the intervention 
      is most effective. In a randomized controlled trial (N = 30), we explored whether 
      individuals with higher levels of pretreatment trait mindfulness would benefit 
      more from MBSR intervention. Results demonstrated that relative to a control 
      condition (n = 15), MBSR treatment (n = 15) had significant effects on several 
      outcomes, including increased trait mindfulness, subjective well-being, and 
      empathy measured at 2 and 12 months after treatment. However, relative to 
      controls, MBSR participants with higher levels of pretreatment mindfulness showed 
      a larger increase in mindfulness, subjective well-being, empathy, and hope, and 
      larger declines in perceived stress up to 1 year after treatment.

TI  - Daily micropractice can augment single-session interventions: A randomized 
      controlled trial of self-compassionate touch and examining their associations 
      with habit formation in US college students.

AB  - In this pre-registered study, we evaluated the effects of a single-session, 
      self-guided intervention, leveraging daily micropractice (≤20 seconds/day 
      practice) of self-compassionate touch to enhance self-compassion. We randomly 
      assigned undergraduates (N = 135) to one of two conditions: a single-session 
      intervention in which they were taught self-compassionate touch or a 
      finger-tapping active control. Then, we instructed them to practice for 
      20 seconds/day for one month. At baseline (T1) and one-month follow-up (T2), 
      participants completed assessments of self-compassion, growth mindset, positive 
      affect, stress, psychopathology, habit formation, and more. In confirmatory, 
      intention-to-treat analyses (N = 135), we found no significant effects on these 
      outcomes. However, in confirmatory, per-protocol analyses (comparing the subsets 
      from each condition who practiced>28 times, N = 45), self-compassionate touch, 
      relative to active control, predicted T1-to-T2 increases in self-compassion 
      (β = 0.71, p = .025), and reductions in stress (β = -0.62, p = .047) and 
      psychopathology (β = -0.61, p = .046). In exploratory intention-to-treat analyses 
      (N = 135), we found the same pattern of effects as in the per-protocol analyses 
      among those who practiced self-compassionate touch more frequently relative to 
      active control. We discuss factors associated with habit formation of daily 
      practice. Daily micropractices have the potential for augmenting single-session 
      interventions and for offering help when more time-intensive approaches may be 
      less accessible. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05199779.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a Stress Management and Resiliency Training 
      (SMART) program for decreasing stress and anxiety and improving resilience and 
      quality of life among Department of Radiology physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The study was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 26 
      Department of Radiology physicians were randomized in a single-blind trial to 
      either the SMART program or a wait-list control arm for 12 weeks. The program 
      involved a single 90-min group session in the SMART training with two follow-up 
      phone calls. Primary outcomes measured at baseline and week 12 included the 
      Perceived Stress Scale, Linear Analog Self-Assessment Scale, Mindful Attention 
      Awareness Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. RESULTS: A total of 22 
      physicians completed the study. A statistically significant improvement in 
      perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and mindfulness at 12 weeks was 
      observed in the study arm compared to the wait-list control arm; resilience also 
      improved in the active arm, but the changes were not statistically significant 
      when compared to the control arm. CONCLUSIONS: A single session to decrease 
      stress among radiologists using the SMART program is feasible. Furthermore, the 
      intervention afforded statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
      improvement in anxiety, stress, quality of life, and mindful attention. Further 
      studies including larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted.

TI  - Effects of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) on brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor and low-grade inflammation among fibromyalgia patients: A 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 15639
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-52260-z [doi]
LID - 15639
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disabling syndrome characterized by chronic pain 
      associated with fatigue. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but alterations in central 
      sensitization, involving an imbalance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
      and inflammatory biomarkers, appear to be implicated. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the impact of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) on levels of 
      BDNF, the inflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and the C-reactive protein 
      (CRP), analysing whether biomarkers play a mediating/moderating role in 
      improvements in FM functional status. Thirty-four female patients with FM 
      participated in a RCT and were assigned to ABCT or relaxation therapy. Blood 
      extractions were conducted at baseline and post-intervention, with self-report 
      assessments of functional status (FIQ) at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month 
      follow-up. A pro-inflammatory composite was obtained by summing up IL-6, TNF-α 
      and CRP normalized values. Non-parametric tests, analysis of variance and 
      regression models were used to evaluate treatment and mediation/moderation. 
      Compared to relaxation therapy, ABCT showed significant improvements in FIQ and 
      decreases in BDNF, CRP, and pro-inflammatory composite. Changes in BDNF had a 
      mediating role in FIQ. ABCT seems to reduce BDNF and appears to have 
      anti-inflammatory effects in FM patients. Reductions in BDNF could be a mechanism 
      of FM functional status improvement.Clinical Trial Registration:

TI  - Yoga's impact on risk and protective factors for disordered eating: a pilot 
      prevention trial.
PG  - 513-541
LID - 10.1080/10640266.2020.1763110 [doi]
AB  - Yoga has been proposed as a strategy for improving risk and protective factors 
      for eating disorders, but few prevention trials have been conducted. The purpose 
      of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a yoga 
      series in female college students (n = 52). Participants were randomized to a 
      yoga intervention (three 50-minute yoga classes/week for 10 weeks conducted by 
      certified yoga teachers who received a 3-day intensive training) or a control 
      group. Risk and protective factors, assessed at baseline, 5 and 10 weeks, 
      included body dissatisfaction, negative affect, loneliness, self-compassion, 
      positive affect, and mindfulness. Mixed models controlling for baseline levels of 
      outcome variables were run. On average, participants attended 20 out of 30 yoga 
      classes, and the majority of participants reported high levels of satisfaction 
      with the yoga series. Appearance orientation decreased and positive affect 
      increased in the yoga group relative to the control group. After controlling for 
      baseline levels, the yoga group had a significantly higher positive affect than 
      the control group. Changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant, 
      as compared to the control condition. Future yoga research directions are 
      discussed including education about body image, measure and sample selection, and 
      use of an implementation science framework.

TI  - The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Empowerment Program on Self-Compassion, 
      Self-Esteem and Ways of Coping With Stress of Women Experienced Violence: A 
      Randomised Controlled Study.
LID - 10.1111/inm.13401 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this experimental research is to assess the impact of a 
      mindfulness-based empowerment program applied to women who have experienced 
      violence on their levels of self-compassion, self-esteem and coping with stress. 
      The study was a randomised controlled trial with a control group. Participants 
      were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n(1) = 27) and the control 
      group (CG, n(2) = 26) from women who had experienced violence. Descriptive 
      statistical methods and t-tests for dependent and independent groups were 
      employed in data analysis. After the mindfulness-based empowerment program, the 
      intervention group exhibited a statistically significant high effect size in 
      post-intervention measurements compared to the control group for the 
      Self-Compassion Scale, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Coping Styles Scale 
      total and subscale mean scores (p < 0.001). The mindfulness-based empowerment 
      program has been found to enhance self-compassion, self-esteem and coping levels 
      in women who have experienced violence. Therefore, it is recommended to promote 
      the widespread adoption of mindfulness-based interventions for individuals who 
      have undergone trauma, such as violence, to facilitate their re-empowerment and 
      functional recovery. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

TI  - Effectiveness of a positive psychology and mindfulness-based app on mental health 
      for parents of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder: study protocol of a 
      pragmatic international randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 412

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parents of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) 
      experience more stress than parents of typically developing children. In a 
      cocreation process with experts and parents, a low-threshold application that 
      uses exercises based on the principles of positive psychology and mindfulness was 
      developed. This application, called "Adappt," aims at enhancing the ability to 
      adapt of the parents and caregivers of children with NDDs and at supporting their 
      mental health. This protocol describes the evaluation study of the effectiveness 
      of Adappt, its core working mechanisms and user experiences. METHOD: A pragmatic 
      international multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the 
      effectiveness of Adappt with a (delayed) waitlist control condition. At least 212 
      parents or primary caregivers of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with or 
      suspected of a NDD will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist 
      control condition. Participants are excluded if they have severe anxiety or 
      depression levels or are in treatment for mental health issues. Measures will be 
      collected online at baseline, post-intervention (1 month after baseline), and 4 
      and 7 months after baseline. The primary outcome is the improvement in generic 
      sense of ability to adapt as measured with the Generic Sense of Ability to Adapt 
      Scale (GSAAS; (Front Psychol 14:985408, 2023)) at 4-month follow-up. Secondary 
      outcomes are mental well-being, (parental) distress, and client satisfaction with 
      "Adappt." DISCUSSION: Results of this study will contribute to knowledge on the 
      effectiveness of a low-threshold application for parents of children with a NDD 
      in multiple countries. If the application is found to be effective in improving 
      mental health, recommendations will be made for implementation in health care. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06248762) 
      on February 8, 2024, and the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/5znqv ).

TI  - Exploring the efficacy of an acceptance, mindfulness & compassionate-based group 
      intervention for women struggling with their weight (Kg-Free): A randomized 
      controlled trial.

AB  - This randomized-controlled trial aims to test the efficacy of a group 
      intervention (Kg-Free) for women with overweight or obesity based on mindfulness, 
      ACT and compassion approaches. The intervention aimed to reduce weight 
      self-stigma and unhealthy eating patterns and increase quality-of-life (QoL). 
      Seventy-three women, aged between 18 and 55 years old, with BMI ≥25 without 
      binge-eating seeking weight loss treatment were randomly assigned to intervention 
      or control groups. Kg-Free comprises 10 weekly group sessions plus 2 booster 
      fortnightly sessions, of 2h30 h each. The control group maintained Treatment as 
      Usual (TAU). Data was collected at baseline and at the end of the Kg-Free 
      intervention. Overall, participants enrolled in Kg-Free found the intervention to 
      be very important and helpful when dealing with their weight-related unwanted 
      internal experiences. Moreover, when compared with TAU, the Kg-Free group 
      revealed a significant increased health-related QoL and physical exercise and a 
      reduction of weight self-stigma, unhealthy eating behaviors, BMI, self-criticism, 
      weight-related experiential avoidance and psychopathological symptoms at 
      post-treatment. Results for self-compassion showed a trend towards significance, 
      whereas no significant between-groups differences were found for mindfulness. 
      Taken together, evidence was found for Kg-Free efficacy in reducing 
      weight-related negative experiences and promoting healthy behaviors, 
      psychological functioning, and QoL.

TI  - Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) versus Supportive Expressive Group 
      Therapy (SET) for distressed breast cancer survivors: evaluating mindfulness and 
      social support as mediators.
PG  - 414-422
LID - 10.1007/s10865-016-9799-6 [doi]
AB  - Despite growing evidence in support of mindfulness as an underlying mechanism of 
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), it has been suggested that nonspecific 
      therapeutic factors, such as the experience of social support, may contribute to 
      the positive effects of MBIs. In the present study, we examined whether change in 
      mindfulness and/or social support mediated the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cancer 
      Recovery (MBCR) compared to another active intervention (i.e. Supportive 
      Expressive Group Therapy (SET)), on change in mood disturbance, stress symptoms 
      and quality of life. A secondary analysis was conducted of a multi-site 
      randomized clinical trial investigating the impacts of MBCR and SET on distressed 
      breast cancer survivors (MINDSET). We applied the causal steps approach with 
      bootstrapping to test mediation, using pre- and post-intervention questionnaire 
      data of the participants who were randomised to MBCR (n = 69) or SET (n = 70). 
      MBCR participants improved significantly more on mood disturbance, stress 
      symptoms and social support, but not on quality of life or mindfulness, compared 
      to SET participants. Increased social support partially mediated the impact of 
      MBCR versus SET on mood disturbance and stress symptoms. Because no group 
      differences on mindfulness and quality of life were observed, no mediation 
      analyses were performed on these variables. Findings showed that increased social 
      support was related to more improvement in mood and stress after MBCR compared to 
      support groups, whereas changes in mindfulness were not. This suggests a more 
      important role for social support in enhancing outcomes in MBCR than previously 
      thought.

TI  - Yoga and compassion meditation program improve quality of life and 
      self-compassion in family caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients: A 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 85-91
LID - 10.1111/ggi.12675 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effects of the practice of yoga in combination with 
      compassion meditation on the quality of life, attention, vitality and 
      self-compassion of family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
      METHODS: A total of 46 volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups, the yoga 
      and compassion meditation program group (n = 25), and the control group (CG) that 
      received no treatment (n = 21). The program lasted 8 weeks, and comprised three 
      yoga and meditation practices per week, with each session lasting 1 h and 15 min. 
      Quality of life, attention, vitality, and self-compassion scores were measured 
      pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: The yoga and compassion meditation program 
      group showed statistically significant improvements (P < 0.05) on quality of 
      life, attention, vitality and self-compassion scores as compared with the control 
      group, which showed no statistical significant differences at the 
      postintervention time-point. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study 
      suggest that an 8-week yoga and compassion meditation program can improve the 
      quality of life, vitality, attention, and self-compassion of family caregivers of 
      Alzheimer's disease patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 85-91.

TI  - Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy and Persistent Pain in Women Treated for 
      Primary Breast Cancer: Exploring Possible Statistical Mediators: Results From a 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 59-67
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000510 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate possible statistical 
      mediators in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy 
      (MBCT) on pain intensity in women treated for primary breast cancer. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 129 women treated for breast cancer, 
      presenting with persistent pain, who were randomly assigned to MBCT or a 
      wait-list control. We previously reported a statistically significant and robust 
      effect of MBCT on pain intensity (11-point numeric rating scale), which was 
      included as the primary outcome. The proposed mediators were mindfulness (the 
      Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), self-compassion (the Short-Form 
      Self-Compassion Scale), and pain catastrophizing (the Pain Catastrophizing 
      Scale). Measurement points included baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 3- 
      (T3) and 6-month (T4) follow-ups. All indirect effects of the mediators were 
      tested in separate Multilevel Models, using the product-of-coefficients approach 
      with bias-corrected confidence intervals (95% BSCI). The statistically 
      significant mediators were then included in a multiple mediator model. RESULTS: 
      Statistically significant indirect effects were found for mindfulness 
      nonreactivity (B=-0.17, BSCI [-0.32 to -0.04]) and pain catastrophizing (B=-0.76, 
      BSCI [-1.25 to -0.47]). No statistically significant indirect effect was found 
      for self-compassion (B=-0.09, BSCI [-0.30 to 0.04]). In a multiple mediator 
      model, including mindfulness nonreactivity and pain catastrophizing, only pain 
      catastrophizing remained statistically significant (B=-0.72, BSCI [-1.19 to 
      -0.33]), explaining 78% of the effect. DISCUSSION: The results of the present 
      study may have clinical implications. An increased focus on the proposed 
      mediators may optimize the clinical use of MBCT for persistent pain in women 
      treated for breast cancer.

TI  - Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience 
      in adults vulnerable to depression: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 618-28
LID - 10.1037/a0024595 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) 
      increases momentary positive emotions and the ability to make use of natural 
      rewards in daily life. METHOD: Adults with a life-time history of depression and 
      current residual depressive symptoms (mean age = 43.9 years, SD = 9.6; 75% 
      female; all Caucasian) were randomized to MBCT (n = 64) or waitlist control 
      (CONTROL; n = 66) in a parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The 
      Experience Sampling Method was used to measure momentary positive emotions as 
      well as appraisal of pleasant activities in daily life during 6 days before and 
      after the intervention. Residual depressive symptoms were measured using the 
      17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960). RESULTS: MBCT compared 
      to CONTROL was associated with significant increases in appraisals of positive 
      emotion (b* = .39) and activity pleasantness (b* = .22) as well as enhanced 
      ability to boost momentary positive emotions by engaging in pleasant activities 
      (b* = .08; all ps < .005). Associations remained significant when corrected for 
      reductions in depressive symptoms or for reductions in negative emotion, 
      rumination, and worry. In the MBCT condition, increases in positive emotion 
      variables were associated with reduction of residual depressive symptoms (all ps 
      < .05). CONCLUSIONS: MBCT is associated with increased experience of momentary 
      positive emotions as well as greater appreciation of, and enhanced responsiveness 
      to, pleasant daily-life activities. These changes were unlikely to be pure 
      epiphenomena of decreased depression and, given the role of positive emotions in 
      resilience against depression, may contribute to the protective effects of MBCT 
      against depressive relapse.

TI  - A randomized trial of MBSR versus aerobic exercise for social anxiety disorder.
PG  - 715-31
LID - 10.1002/jclp.21863 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Effective treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD) exist, but 
      additional treatment options are needed for nonresponders as well as those who 
      are either unable or unwilling to engage in traditional treatments. 
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one nontraditional treatment that 
      has demonstrated efficacy in treating other mood and anxiety disorders, and 
      preliminary data suggest its efficacy in SAD as well. METHOD: Fifty-six adults 
      (52% female; 41% Caucasian; age mean [M] ± standard deviation [SD]: 32.8 ± 8.4) 
      with SAD were randomized to MBSR or an active comparison condition, aerobic 
      exercise (AE). At baseline and post-intervention, participants completed measures 
      of clinical symptoms (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Social Interaction Anxiety 
      Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Perceived Stress Scale) and subjective 
      well-being (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, 
      Self-Compassion Scale, and UCLA-8 Loneliness Scale). At 3 months 
      post-intervention, a subset of these measures was readministered. For clinical 
      significance analyses, 48 healthy adults (52.1% female; 56.3% Caucasian; age [M ± 
      SD]: 33.9 ± 9.8) were recruited. MBSR and AE participants were also compared with 
      a separate untreated group of 29 adults (44.8% female; 48.3% Caucasian; age [M ± 
      SD]: 32.3 ± 9.4) with generalized SAD who completed assessments over a comparable 
      time period with no intervening treatment. RESULTS: A 2 (Group) x 2 (Time) 
      repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on measures of clinical symptoms 
      and well-being were conducted to examine pre-intervention to post-intervention 
      and pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. Both MBSR and AE were associated with 
      reductions in social anxiety and depression and increases in subjective 
      well-being, both immediately post-intervention and at 3 months post-intervention. 
      When participants in the randomized controlled trial were compared with the 
      untreated SAD group, participants in both interventions exhibited improvements on 
      measures of clinical symptoms and well-being. CONCLUSION: Nontraditional 
      interventions such as MBSR and AE merit further exploration as alternative or 
      complementary treatments for SAD.

TI  - The efficacy of a Mindfulness Based Intervention for depressive symptoms in 
      patients with Multiple Sclerosis and their caregivers: study protocol for a 
      randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 7

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis has a great impact on psychological functioning of 
      patients and can be associated with various mental health disorders and symptoms. 
      The most prevalent one is depression, which ranges from 15 to 47%. Mindfulness 
      Based Interventions are a relatively brief and cost-effective program that has 
      been studied in patients with several chronic diseases and recently also in 
      patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Mindfulness Based Interventions are based on 
      the assumption that a non-judgmental awareness and acceptance of one's 
      moment-to-moment experience can have a positive effect on the adaptation to the 
      disease, reducing the psychological burden and improving patients' quality of 
      life. Several studies concluded that Mindfulness Based Interventions can be 
      beneficial in terms of improving both psychological and psychical aspects of 
      Multiple Sclerosis, but none of them compared the intervention with an active 
      control group. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
      a group-based Mindfulness Based Intervention on depressive symptoms in patients 
      with Multiple Sclerosis, as compared with an active control group. METHODS: The 
      study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Eighty-eight patients 
      with Multiple Sclerosis and depressive symptoms will be recruited and randomized 
      to either Mindfulness Based Intervention or an active control group. The latter 
      is designed to control for non-specific elements of the intervention and it 
      comprises psycho-education and relaxation techniques. The primary outcome is the 
      reduction of depressive symptoms as measured via the Beck Depressive 
      Inventory-II. Secondary outcome measures are level of quality of life, anxiety, 
      perceived stress, illness perception, fatigue and quality of interpersonal 
      relationship. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, after treatment and 6 months 
      after the end of the treatment. Caregivers will participate in groups together 
      with patients. DISCUSSION: As far as we know this trial will be the first 
      randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of group-based Mindfulness Based 
      Intervention for patients with Multiple Sclerosis with a comparison with an 
      active control group with a specific focus on depressive symptoms. TRIAL

      common, particularly among those who care for persons with challenging behaviors 
      and personality or mood changes. Mindfulness and self-compassion programs are 
      efficacious for managing stress. The skills of mindfulness and self-compassion, 
      however, must be integrated with behavioral management skills in order to 
      effectively improve caregiver stress. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to 
      describe the development of the Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care (MASC) 
      program, the first program that combines mindfulness and self-compassion with 
      behavioral management skills to decrease caregiver stress, and its evaluation in 
      the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD Learning (SOCIAL) study. METHODS: Using the 
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) stage model, we describe 3 phases of work 
      encompassing NIH Stages 1A and 1B. In phase 1, we conducted 5 focus groups (N=28) 
      of stressed individuals caring for persons with ADRD and challenging behaviors. 
      Rapid data analysis informed the development of a 6-week online intervention. 
      Phase 2 (NIH stage 1A) includes an open pilot (N>10) with optional exit 
      interviews. Phase 3 (NIH stage 1B) is a feasibility randomized controlled trial 
      of the intervention versus the Health Education Program control. Primary outcomes 
      focus on feasibility with secondary outcomes encompassing acceptability, 
      credibility, fidelity, and signals of preliminary efficacy. Phase 1 follows 
      traditional recommendations for qualitative analyses (at the point of thematic 
      saturation) which was achieved after 5 focus groups (N=28). For the phase 2 open 
      pilot, up to 12 participants will be recruited. For the phase 3 feasibility 
      study, recruitment of 80 caregivers will allow the assessment of feasibility 
      benchmarks. Data for phase 1 included 5 focus groups. In phases 2 and 3, data 
      collection will occur through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; 
      Vanderbilt University) surveys and an optional qualitative exit interview. 
      Analyses will include hybrid inductive-deductive analyses for qualitative data 
      and assessment of changes in our intervention targets and outcomes using t tests 
      and correlation analyses. RESULTS: In phase 1, caregivers reported interest in a 
      brief, online stress management program. Participants held misconceptions about 
      mindfulness and self-compassion, but after detailed explanation thoughts, these 
      skills could be helpful when directly linked to implementation during caregiving 
      routines. Phases 2 and 3 will be completed by the end of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      describe the protocol for the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD Learning study, 
      as well as the development and feasibility testing of the Mindful and 
      Self-Compassionate Care intervention. Future work will include a fully powered 
      efficacy-effectiveness randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Pilot study of a well-being app to support New Zealand young people during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Well-being apps represent a promising and scalable approach for 
      improving mental health outcomes in youth, especially during a global pandemic 
      when access to face-to-face interventions may be limited. Whitu (meaning 7 in the 
      New Zealand Māori language Te Reo) is a newly developed well-being app with 7 
      modules that support young people to learn and practice evidence-based coping 
      skills, including relaxation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and goal-setting. 
      OBJECTIVE: During this pilot, we explored the acceptability, usability, and 
      preliminary efficacy of Whitu before refining the app for a randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT). METHODS: We recruited 20 New Zealand young people aged 16-25 years 
      via social media to trial the first prototype of the Whitu app over 6 weeks. 
      Within-group differences from baseline to 2- and 6-weeks post intervention in 
      self-reported well-being, depression, anxiety, stress, self-compassion, optimism 
      and sleep quality were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVA. A further 21 
      participants aged 16-30 years were recruited to participate in 4 focus groups to 
      give feedback on the app's usability and cultural acceptability. Feedback was 
      analysed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant 
      improvements in anxiety (p = 0.024) and stress (p = 0.017) were observed from 
      baseline to 2-weeks post intervention. Improvements in well-being (p = 0.021), 
      depression (p = 0.031), anxiety (p = 0.005), and stress (p = 0.004) were also 
      observed from baseline to 6-weeks. No statistically significant changes were seen 
      in self-compassion, optimism, or sleep quality. Effect sizes (partial η(2)s) 
      ranged from 0.25 (depression) to 0.42 (stress). Qualitative feedback comprised of 
      five key themes, namely: factors affecting engagement, issues with functionality, 
      preferences regarding aesthetics, effectiveness and adverse effects, and cultural 
      acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that Whitu may be an 
      effective app for improving multiple dimensions of young people's well-being. 
      Modifications to the look and feel, cultural content, and onboarding have been 
      undertaken based on the qualitative feedback, and an RCT is currently underway.

TI  - The effect of mindfulness-based compassionate living training for informal 
      caregivers of palliative inpatients on burnout and caregiving burden: a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 313-322
LID - 10.1093/her/cyae005 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effect of Mindfulness-Based 
      Compassionate Living (MBCL) training given to the informal caregivers of 
      palliative patients on burnout and caregiving burden. A single-blind, randomized, 
      controlled, experimental study was conducted with 54 caregivers of patients 
      admitted to a hospital palliative care unit. The participants were randomly 
      allocated to the experimental group (n = 26) and control group (n = 28). The 
      experimental group received MBCL training twice a week for 4 weeks. Data were 
      collected before and after the intervention using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 
      Caregiver Burden Scale and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. The data were 
      analyzed using kurtosis and skewness coefficients, number, percentage, mean, 
      standard deviation, chi-square test, independent samples t test, Wilcoxon signed 
      ranks test and Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS version 22.0. The informal caregivers 
      in the experimental group demonstrated a significant decrease in emotional 
      exhaustion and depersonalization scores and an increase in personal 
      accomplishment and self-compassion scores in posttest assessments after the MBCL 
      intervention (P < 0.05). All of these parameters differed significantly between 
      the experimental and control groups after the intervention (P < 0.05). MBCL 
      training seems to be effective in reducing emotional exhaustion and 
      depersonalization and increasing personal accomplishment and self-compassion 
      among informal caregivers of palliative inpatients. The results of this study can 
      be generalized to the caretakers of patients receiving palliative care in 
      university hospitals.

TI  - Prevention of internalizing difficulties in the middle years: Protocol for a 
      noninferiority randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for 
      Children and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.
PG  - 547-552
LID - 10.1111/eip.13501 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Mindfulness-based interventions have been tested as preventive programs for 
      childhood internalizing difficulties, but most research has been at a 'universal' 
      level with small to null effects. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for 
      Children (MBCT-C) has similar effects to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) when 
      used as a small-group, targeted preventive program. Knowledge gaps include the 
      longer-term effectiveness of MBCT-C relative to CBT and the benefits of adding a 
      parent module. This trial aims to compare MCBT-C to traditional CBT, including a 
      parent module, to 15-months post-intervention and to test the feasibility and 
      acceptability of adding a parent module. METHODS: Participants will be recruited 
      from primary schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in South Australia 
      (n = 194). Children (aged 9-12) years with signs of internalizing difficulties 
      (e.g., shy, withdrawn, worried), and their parents, will be eligible for this 
      two-armed randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (RCT). Children will 
      participate in 10 group sessions of MBCT-C or CBT, facilitated by psychologists, 
      and parents from both conditions will participate in two parent-only group 
      sessions. Child self-report measures include depression and anxiety, as well as 
      attention, mindfulness and self-compassion. Parent measures include symptoms of 
      depression and anxiety, mindfulness, and parent-child relationship strength. The 
      primary outcome will be child anxiety and depression (Revised Child Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale-25). Measures will be collected pre and post intervention, and 
      at 3, 6, 12 and 15-month follow up. RESULTS: Schools will be recruited from 
      October 2022. Nomination of children will commence from February 2023. Program 
      implementation will begin May 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will have 
      implications for the feasibility of involving parents in preventative programs, 
      as well as whether mindfulness-based interventions prevent internalizing 
      difficulties over time.

TI  - Understanding mechanisms of depression prevention: study protocol of a randomized 
      cross-over trial to investigate mechanisms of mindfulness and positive 
      fantasizing as intervention techniques for reducing perseverative cognition in 
      remitted depressed individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent 
      psychiatric disorders, and involves high relapse rates in which persistent 
      negative thinking and rumination (i.e., perseverative cognition [PC]) play an 
      important role. Positive fantasizing and mindfulness are common evidence-based 
      psychological interventions that have been shown to effectively reduce PC and 
      subsequent depressive relapse. How the interventions cause changes in PC over 
      time, is unknown, but likely differ between the two. Whereas fantasizing may 
      change the valence of thought content, mindfulness may operate through 
      disengaging from automatic thought patterns. Comparing mechanisms of both 
      interventions in a clinical sample and a non-clinical sample can give insight 
      into the effectivity of interventions for different individuals. The current 
      study aims to 1) test whether momentary psychological and psychophysiological 
      indices of PC are differentially affected by positive fantasizing versus 
      mindfulness-based interventions, 2) test whether the mechanisms of change by 
      which fantasizing and mindfulness affect PC differ between remitted MDD versus 
      never-depressed (ND) individuals, and 3) explore potential moderators of the main 
      effects of the two interventions (i.e., what works for whom). METHODS: In this 
      cross-over trial of fantasizing versus mindfulness interventions, we will include 
      50 remitted MDD and 50 ND individuals. Before the start of the measurements, 
      participants complete several individual characteristics. Daily-life diary 
      measures of thoughts and feelings (using an experience sampling method), 
      behavioural measures of spontaneous thoughts (using the Sustained Attention to 
      Response Task), actigraphy, physiological measures (impedance cardiography, 
      electrocardiography, and electroencephalogram), and measures of depressive mood 
      (self-report questionnaires) are performed during the week before (pre-) the 
      interventions and the week during (peri-) the interventions. After a wash-out of 
      at least one month, pre- and peri-intervention measures for the second 
      intervention are repeated. DISCUSSION: This is the first study integrating 
      self-reports, behavioural-, and physiological measures capturing dynamics at 
      multiple time scales to examine the differential mechanisms of change in PC by 
      psychological interventions in individuals remitted from multiple MDD episodes 
      and ND individuals. Unravelling how therapeutic techniques affect PC in remitted 
      individuals might generate insights that allows development of personalised 
      targeted relapse prevention interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effects of Contemplative Dyads on Engagement and Perceived Social Connectedness 
      Over 9 Months of Mental Training: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 126-134
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3360 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Loneliness is a risk factor for depression and other illnesses and 
      may be caused and reinforced by maladaptive social cognition. Secularized 
      classical meditation training programs address social cognition, but practice 
      typically occurs alone. Little is known about the effectiveness of contemplative 
      practice performed in dyads. OBJECTIVE: To introduce and assess the effectiveness 
      of contemplative dyadic practices relative to classical-solitary meditation with 
      regard to engagement and perceived social connectedness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: The ReSource Project was a 9-month open-label efficacy trial of 
      three, 3-month secularized mental training modules. Replacement randomization was 
      used to assign 362 healthy participants in Leipzig and Berlin, Germany. Eligible 
      participants were recruited between November 11, 2012, and February 13, 2013, and 
      between November 13, 2013, and April 30, 2014. Intention-to-treat analyses were 
      conducted. INTERVENTIONS: Breathing meditation and body scan (the presence 
      module), loving-kindness meditation and affect dyad (the affect module), and 
      observing-thoughts meditation and perspective dyad (the perspective module). MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were self-disclosure and social 
      closeness. Engagement measures included compliance (ie, the mean [95% margin of 
      error] number of meditation sessions that a participant engaged in per week), 
      liking, and motivation to practice. RESULTS: Thirty participants dropped out 
      after assignment to 3 experimental groups; 90 participants were assigned to a 
      retest control that did not complete the main outcome measures; 16 participants 
      provided no state-change data for the affect and perspective modules (226 
      remaining participants; mean age of 41.15 years; 59.3% female). Results are 
      aggregated across training cohorts. Compliance was similar across the modules: 
      loving-kindness meditation (3.78 [0.18] sessions), affect dyad (3.59 [0.14] 
      sessions), observing-thoughts meditation (3.63 [0.20] sessions), and perspective 
      dyad (3.24 [0.18] sessions). Motivation was higher for meditation (11.20 [0.40] 
      sessions) than the dyads (9.26 [0.43] sessions) and was higher for the affect 
      dyad (10.11 [0.46] sessions) than the perspective dyad (8.41 [0.46] sessions). 
      Social closeness increased during a session for the affect dyad (1.49 [0.12] 
      sessions) and the perspective dyad (1.06 [0.12] sessions) and increased over time 
      for the affect dyad (slope of 0.016 [0.003]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 
      0.012 [0.003]). Self-disclosure increased over time for the affect dyad (slope of 
      0.023 [0.004]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 0.006 [0.005]), increasing more 
      steeply for the affect dyad (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Contemplative 
      dyads elicited engagement similar to classical contemplative practices and 
      increased perceived social connectedness. Contemplative dyads represent a new 
      type of intervention targeting social connectedness and intersubjective 
      capacities deficient in participants who experience loneliness and in many 
      psychopathologies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Evaluation of a specialized yoga program for persons with a spinal cord injury: a 
      pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 999-1017
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S130530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the 
      effects of a specialized yoga program for individuals with a spinal cord injury 
      (SCI) on pain, psychological, and mindfulness variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Participants with SCI (n=23) were outpatients or community members affiliated 
      with a rehabilitation hospital. Participants were randomized to an Iyengar yoga 
      (IY; n=11) group or to a 6-week wait-list control (WLC; n=12) group. The IY group 
      participated in a twice-weekly 6-week seated IY program; the WLC group 
      participated in the same yoga program, after the IY group's yoga program had 
      ended. Pain, psychological, and mindfulness measures were collected at two time 
      points for both groups (within 1-2 weeks before and after program 1 and at a 
      third time point for the WLC group (within 1 week after program 2). RESULTS: 
      Linear mixed-effect growth models were conducted to evaluate the main effects of 
      group at T2 (postintervention), controlling for T1 (preintervention) scores. T2 
      depression scores were lower (F(1,18)=6.1, P<0.05) and T2 self-compassion scores 
      higher (F(1,18)=6.57, P< 0.05) in the IY group compared to the WLC group. To 
      increase sample size and power, the two groups were combined and analyzed across 
      time by comparing pre- and postintervention scores. Main effects of time were 
      found for depression scores, (F(1,14.83)=6.62, P<0.05), self-compassion, 
      (F(1,16.6)=4.49, P<0.05), mindfulness (F(1,16.79)=5.42, P<0.05), mindful 
      observing (F(1,19.82)=5.06, P<0.05), and mindful nonreactivity, (F(1,16.53)=4.92, 
      P<0.05), all showing improvement after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The results 
      indicated that a specialized 6-week yoga intervention reduced depressive symptoms 
      and increased self-compassion in individuals with SCI, and may also have fostered 
      greater mindfulness.

TI  - Non-verbal communication of compassion: measuring psychophysiologic effects.
PG  - 132
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-11-132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calm, compassionate clinicians comfort others. To evaluate the direct 
      psychophysiologic benefits of non-verbal communication of compassion (NVCC), it 
      is important to minimize the effect of subjects' expectation. This preliminary 
      study was designed to a) test the feasibility of two strategies for maintaining 
      subject blinding to non-verbal communication of compassion (NVCC), and b) 
      determine whether blinded subjects would experience psychophysiologic effects 
      from NVCC. METHODS: Subjects were healthy volunteers who were told the study was 
      evaluating the effect of time and touch on the autonomic nervous system. The 
      practitioner had more than 10 years' experience with loving-kindness meditation 
      (LKM), a form of NVCC. Subjects completed 10-point visual analog scales (VAS) for 
      stress, relaxation, and peacefulness before and after LKM. To assess physiologic 
      effects, practitioners and subjects wore cardiorespiratory monitors to assess 
      respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) 
      throughout the 4 10-minute study periods: Baseline (both practitioner and 
      subjects read neutral material); non-tactile-LKM (subjects read while the 
      practitioner practiced LKM while pretending to read); tactile-LKM (subjects 
      rested while the practitioner practiced LKM while lightly touching the subject on 
      arms, shoulders, hands, feet, and legs); Post-Intervention Rest (subjects rested; 
      the practitioner read). To assess blinding, subjects were asked after the 
      interventions what the practitioner was doing during each period (reading, touch, 
      or something else). RESULTS: Subjects' mean age was 43.6 years; all were women. 
      Blinding was maintained and the practitioner was able to maintain meditation for 
      both tactile and non-tactile LKM interventions as reflected in significantly 
      reduced RR. Despite blinding, subjects' VAS scores improved from baseline to 
      post-intervention for stress (5.5 vs. 2.2), relaxation (3.8 vs. 8.8) and 
      peacefulness (3.8 vs. 9.0, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Subjects also had 
      significant reductions in RR (P < 0.0001) and improved HRV (P < 0.05) with both 
      tactile and non-tactile LKM. CONCLUSION: It is possible to test the effects of 
      LKM with tactile and non-tactile blinding strategies; even with blinding in this 
      small preliminary study, subjects reported significant improvements in well-being 
      which were reflected in objective physiologic measures of autonomic activity. 
      Extending compassion is not only good care; it may also be good medicine. TRIAL

TI  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction added to care as usual for lung cancer 
      patients and/or their partners: A multicentre randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 2118-2126
LID - 10.1002/pon.4430 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer patients report among the highest distress rates of all 
      cancer patients. Partners report similar distress rates. The present study 
      examined the effectiveness of additional mindfulness-based stress reduction (care 
      as usual [CAU] + MBSR) versus solely CAU to reduce psychological distress in lung 
      cancer patients and/or their partners. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, 
      parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. Mindfulness-based stress reduction 
      is an 8-week group-based intervention, including mindfulness practice and 
      teachings on stress. Care as usual included anticancer treatment, medical 
      consultations, and supportive care. The primary outcome was psychological 
      distress. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, caregiver burden, 
      relationship satisfaction, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, rumination, and 
      posttraumatic stress symptoms. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Linear mixed modeling was conducted on 
      an intention-to-treat sample. Moderation (gender, disease stage, baseline 
      distress, participation with/without partner) and mediation analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients and 21 partners were randomized to 
      CAU + MBSR and 32 patients and 23 partners to CAU. After CAU + MBSR patients 
      reported significantly less psychological distress (p = .008, d = .69) than after 
      CAU. Baseline distress moderated outcome: those with more distress benefitted 
      most from MBSR. Additionally, after CAU + MBSR patients showed more improvements 
      in quality of life, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and rumination than 
      after CAU. In partners, no differences were found between groups. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings suggest that psychological distress in lung cancer patients can be 
      effectively treated with MBSR. No effect was found in partners, possibly because 
      they were more focused on patients' well-being rather than their own.

TI  - The Impact of Loving-Kindness Meditation on Job-Related Burnout of Nurses Working 
      in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A Randomized Clinical Trial Study.
PG  - 259-266
LID - 10.1097/HNP.0000000000000657 [doi]
AB  - Job-related burnout is one health outcome in nurses working in neonatal intensive 
      care units (NICUs) due to the heavy workload, which results in negative physical 
      and psychological consequences. One newly introduced approach to improve coping 
      is loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Some studies have shown the effectiveness of 
      the LKM on the mental health of nurses, though more evidence is required to 
      support them. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the LKM on 
      job-related burnout of nurses working in NICU. This clustered controlled 
      randomized clinical trial assessed job-related burnout before and after a month 
      of practicing LKM guided through a virtual method. A total of 66 eligible NICU 
      nurses from 2 referral children hospitals in Tehran were randomly assigned to 2 
      control (n = 33) and intervention (n = 33) groups. The intervention was performed 
      3 times a week for 1 month in the form of 20-minute audio files of LKM for the 
      intervention group, and educational files on mental health during the COVID-19 
      pandemic were sent to the control group. The instruments used in this study were 
      the demographic information questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 
      which participants completed before and after the intervention. The mean 
      difference in the overall scores of burnout before and after the intervention in 
      the intervention group was significantly reduced (P = .003), but no significant 
      difference was observed in the control group (P = .018). These findings support 
      the benefit of LKM in NICU nurses in reducing burnout.

TI  - Examining the Effects of a Brief, Fully Self-Guided Mindfulness Ecological 
      Momentary Intervention on Empathy and Theory-of-Mind for Generalized Anxiety 
      Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e54412
LID - 10.2196/54412 [doi]
LID - e54412
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions 
      (EMIs) to improve empathy and theory-of-mind has been underinvestigated, 
      particularly in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). OBJECTIVE: In this randomized 
      controlled trial, we aimed to examine the efficacy of a 14-day, fully 
      self-guided, mindfulness EMI on the empathy and theory-of-mind domains for GAD. 
      METHODS: Adults (aged ≥18 y) diagnosed with GAD were randomized to a mindfulness 
      EMI (68/110, 61.8%) or self-monitoring app (42/110, 38.2%) arm. They completed 
      the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report empathy measure and theory-of-mind 
      test (Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task) at prerandomization, 
      postintervention, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU) time points. Hierarchical linear 
      modeling was conducted with the intent-to-treat principle to determine 
      prerandomization to postintervention (pre-post intervention) and prerandomization 
      to 1MFU (pre-1MFU) changes, comparing the mindfulness EMI to self-monitoring. 
      RESULTS: Observed effects were generally stronger from pre-1MFU than from 
      pre-post intervention time points. From pre-post intervention time points, the 
      mindfulness EMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app on fantasy (the 
      ability to imagine being in others' shoes; between-intervention effect size: 
      Cohen d=0.26, P=.007; within-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.22, P=.02 for 
      the mindfulness EMI and Cohen d=-0.16, P=.10 for the self-monitoring app). From 
      pre-1MFU time points, the mindfulness EMI, but not the self-monitoring app, 
      improved theory-of-mind (a window into others' thoughts and intentions through 
      abstract, propositional knowledge about their mental states, encompassing the 
      ability to decipher social cues) and the fantasy, personal distress (stress when 
      witnessing others' negative experiences), and perspective-taking (understanding 
      others' perspective) empathy domains. The effect sizes were small to moderate 
      (Cohen d=0.15-0.36; P<.001 to P=.01) for significant between-intervention effects 
      from pre-1MFU time points. Furthermore, the within-intervention effect sizes for 
      these significant outcomes were stronger for the mindfulness EMI (Cohen 
      d=0.30-0.43; P<.001 to P=.03) than the self-monitoring app (Cohen d=-0.12 to 
      0.21; P=.001 to P>.99) from pre-1MFU time points. No between-intervention and 
      within-intervention effects on empathic concern (feeling affection, compassion, 
      and care when observing others in distress, primarily attending to their 
      emotional well-being) were observed from pre-post intervention and pre-1MFU time 
      points. CONCLUSIONS: The brief mindfulness EMI improved specific domains of 
      empathy (eg, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective-taking) and 
      theory-of-mind with small to moderate effect sizes in persons with GAD. 
      Higher-intensity, self-guided or coach-facilitated, multicomponent mindfulness 
      EMIs targeting the optimization of social relationships are likely necessary to 
      improve the empathic concern domain in this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Background: Trauma-related guilt and shame are crucial for the development and 
      maintenance of PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). We developed an intervention 
      combining cognitive techniques with loving-kindness meditations (C-METTA) that 
      specifically target these emotions. C-METTA is an intervention of six weekly 
      individual treatment sessions followed by a four-week practice phase.Objective: 
      This study examined C-METTA in a proof-of-concept study within a randomized 
      wait-list controlled trial.Method: We randomly assigned 32 trauma-exposed 
      patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis to C-METTA or a wait-list condition (WL). Primary 
      outcomes were clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (CAPS-5) and trauma-related guilt and 
      shame. Secondary outcomes included psychopathology, self-criticism, well-being, 
      and self-compassion. Outcomes were assessed before the intervention phase and 
      after the practice phase.Results: Mixed-design analyses showed greater reductions 
      in C-METTA versus WL in clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (d = -1.09), guilt 
      (d = -2.85), shame (d = -2.14), psychopathology and self-criticism.Conclusion: 
      Our findings support positive outcomes of C-METTA and might contribute to 
      improved care for patients with stress-related disorders. The study was 
      registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00023470).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The academic development and widespread adoption of meditation 
      practices for well-being and therapy have predominantly focused on secularised 
      adaptations of Buddhist and Hindu techniques. This study aims to expand the field 
      by investigating Christian and Islamic meditation that emphasize the spiritual 
      significance of the heart through elements of visualisation and recitation. It 
      compares the effects of spiritual heart-centred meditation with mindfulness 
      meditation and a waitlist control, focusing on dimensions of social functioning, 
      psychophysiology, cognition, and mental health. METHOD: This study employs a 
      stratified 3-arm randomised controlled method with mixed-method repeated measures 
      across three assessment time points: before intervention (T1), after an 8-week 
      intervention (T2), and at a 3-month follow up (T3). The three conditions include 
      spiritual meditation (either Christian or Islamic), mindfulness meditation 
      (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction - MBSR), and a waitlist. Participants will be 
      stratified into Christian and Muslim samples and randomly allocated to the 
      spiritual meditation, MBSR, or waitlist control conditions. Importantly, 
      participants assigned to the spiritual meditation condition will be matched to 
      the spiritual meditation program corresponding to their religion. The 
      intervention will be administered through a mobile phone app with daily 20-minute 
      guided meditation sessions for eight weeks. Primary outcomes pertain to the 
      domain of interpersonal functioning, focusing on prosociality, forgiveness, 
      empathy, and perspective taking. Secondary outcomes include physiology: pain 
      tolerance, pain intensity, stress reactivity assessed via heart rate (HR) and 
      heart rate variability (HRV), psychophysiological reactivity associated with a 
      forgiveness task as measured through HR and HRV, attention (alerting, orienting, 
      and executive attention networks), and mental health (stress, depression, 
      anxiety, subjective well-being, positive and negative affect). DISCUSSION: This 
      trial aims to test the effects of an app-based Christian and Islamic meditation, 
      compared to secular mindfulness and a waitlist, using a randomised controlled 
      trial. If the results yield positive outcomes, this study will support the 
      efficacy of these contemplations, offering practitioners a way to enhance their 
      well-being within their religious framework. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Reducing parenting stress in Chinese parents of children with learning 
      disabilities with a mindful parenting program: A randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parents raising children with Learning Disabilities (LDs) often face 
      multiple challenges and high levels of parenting stress, especially in societies 
      with intense academic competitions. Mindful parenting (MP) is an emerging 
      approach that brings mindful awareness to parent-child interactions and is found 
      effective in reducing parenting stress in various parent populations. AIMS: This 
      study examined the effectivenesss of an 8-week online MP program on Chinese 
      parents of children with LDs. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A MP program was adapted 
      and implemented in an online format with 69 parents of children with LDs. A 
      randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the efficacy of the 
      mindful parenting group compared with a wait-list control group. Parenting 
      stress, mindful parenting and self-compassion were assessed pre- and 
      post-intervention. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Compared with the wait-list control 
      group, the MP group participants showed decreased parenting stress (d = 0.62, 
      p < 0.05), improved mindful parenting (d = 0.63, p < 0.05), and increased 
      self-compassion (d = 0.61, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These 
      findings support the effectiveness of an online MP intervention in reducing 
      parenting stress and increasing mindful parenting and self-compassion among 
      Chinese parents of children with LDs. The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of 
      MP are more amenable to improvement, whereas the attitudinal and interpersonal 
      aspects, particularly non-judgmental acceptance and compassion towards the child, 
      are resistant to change. Future studies should explore strategies to enhance 
      these attitudinal aspects and interpersonal processes of MP.

TI  - Moderators of Intervention Efficacy in the Pathways to Wellness Trial of 
      Survivorship Education and Mindfulness Meditation for Younger Breast Cancer 
      Survivors.
PG  - 1410-1419
LID - 10.1200/OP.23.00617 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression is associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer survivors 
      (BCSs), with higher prevalence among younger women. The Pathways to Wellness 
      (PTW; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139) randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) demonstrated beneficial effects of two behavioral interventions 
      (survivorship education [SE] and mindful awareness practices [MAPs]) on 
      depressive symptoms in younger BCS. We conducted an exploratory secondary 
      analysis to identify moderators of intervention effects. METHODS: Women diagnosed 
      with stage 0 to III breast cancer at or before age 50 years who completed cancer 
      treatment were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of SE (n = 81), MAPs (n = 85), or 
      waitlist control (WLC; n = 81). Moderators assessed at baseline included 
      psychological distress (depression and anxiety), intervention preference, 
      preparedness for survivorship, and time since initial diagnosis. Linear 
      regression models tested the modifying effects of each variable on 
      postintervention depression in SE versus WLC and MAPs versus WLC. RESULTS: 
      Baseline levels of depression (β = -.03, P < .01) and anxiety (β = -.64, P = .02) 
      moderated effects of SE on depressive symptoms, as did preparedness for 
      survivorship (β = 3.17, P = .02). Participants randomly assigned to SE who had 
      the highest levels of depression or anxiety and who felt least prepared for 
      survivorship showed the largest reductions in depressive symptoms from 
      preintervention to postintervention. Similar effects were not observed for MAPs. 
      Intervention preference and time since diagnosis did not moderate intervention 
      effects for either SE or MAPs. CONCLUSION: Our 6-week, group-based SE program may 
      be most beneficial for women with higher levels of psychological distress and 
      those who feel least prepared for cancer survivorship. By contrast, a 6-week 
      mindfulness awareness practice intervention appears to benefit younger BCS 
      regardless of pretreatment characteristics.

TI  - Slow art plus: developing and piloting a single session art gallery-based 
      intervention for mental health promotion via a mixed method waitlist randomized 
      control trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current study builds on the expertise of National Gallery 
      Singapore and Nanyang Technological University Singapore (NTU) in developing and 
      piloting an enhanced version of the Slow Art program, namely "Slow Art Plus" for 
      mental health promotion. METHODS: A single-site, open-label, waitlist Randomized 
      Control Trial (RCT) design comprising of a treatment group and waitlist control 
      group was adopted (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05803226). Participants (N = 196) 
      completed three online questionnaires at three timepoints: baseline [T1], 
      immediately post-intervention/s baseline [T2], post-intervention 
      follow-up/immediately post-intervention [T3]. Qualitative focus groups were 
      conducted to evaluate program acceptability. RESULTS: A mixed model ANOVA was 
      performed to understand intervention effectiveness between the immediate 
      intervention group and waitlist control group. The analyses revealed a 
      significant interaction effect where intervention group participants reported an 
      improvement in spiritual well-being (p = 0.001), describing their thoughts and 
      experiences (p = 0.02), and nonreacting to inner experiences (p = 0.01) 
      immediately after Slow Art Plus as compared to the control group. Additionally, 
      one-way repeated measure ANOVAs were conducted for the intervention group to 
      evaluate maintenance effects of the intervention. The analyses indicated 
      significant improvements in perceived stress (p < 0.001), mindfulness (p < 0.001) 
      as well as multiple mindfulness subscales, active engagement with the world 
      (p = 0.003), and self-compassion (p = 0.02) 1 day after the completion of Slow 
      Art Plus. Results from framework analysis of focus group data revealed a total of 
      two themes (1: Experiences of Slow Art Plus, 2: Insights to Effective 
      Implementation) and six subthemes (1a: Peaceful relaxation, 1b: Self-Compassion, 
      1c: Widened Perspective, 2a: Valuable Components, 2b: Execution Requisites, 2c: 
      Suggested Enhancements), providing valuable insights to the overall experience 
      and implementation of the intervention. DISCUSSION: Slow Art Plus represents a 
      unique approach, offering a standardized, multimodal, single-session program that 
      integrates mindfulness and self-compassion practices, as well as reflective and 
      creative expressions with Southeast Asian art. It demonstrates potential in 
      meeting the mental health needs of a wide range of individuals and could be 
      readily incorporated into social prescribing initiatives for diverse populations.

LID - e49467
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies show that intense work schedules make health care 
      professionals particularly vulnerable to emotional exhaustion and burnout. 
      OBJECTIVE: In this scenario, promoting self-compassion and mindfulness may be 
      beneficial for well-being. Notably, scalable, digital app-based methods may have 
      the potential to enhance self-compassion and mindfulness in health care 
      professionals. METHODS: In this study, we designed and implemented a scalable, 
      digital app-based, brief mindfulness and compassion training program called 
      "WellMind" for health care professionals. A total of 22 adult participants 
      completed up to 60 sessions of WellMind training, 5-10 minutes in duration each, 
      over 3 months. Participants completed behavioral assessments measuring 
      self-compassion and mindfulness at baseline (preintervention), 3 months 
      (postintervention), and 6 months (follow-up). In order to control for practice 
      effects on the repeat assessments and calculate effect sizes, we also studied a 
      no-contact control group of 21 health care professionals who only completed the 
      repeated assessments but were not provided any training. Additionally, we 
      evaluated pre- and postintervention neural activity in core brain networks using 
      electroencephalography source imaging as an objective neurophysiological training 
      outcome. RESULTS: Findings showed a post- versus preintervention increase in 
      self-compassion (Cohen d=0.57; P=.007) and state-mindfulness (d=0.52; P=.02) only 
      in the WellMind training group, with improvements in self-compassion sustained at 
      follow-up (d=0.8; P=.01). Additionally, WellMind training durations correlated 
      with the magnitude of improvement in self-compassion across human participants 
      (ρ=0.52; P=.01). Training-related neurophysiological results revealed plasticity 
      specific to the default mode network (DMN) that is implicated in mind-wandering 
      and rumination, with DMN network suppression selectively observed at the 
      postintervention time point in the WellMind group (d=-0.87; P=.03). We also found 
      that improvement in self-compassion was directly related to the extent of DMN 
      suppression (ρ=-0.368; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, promising behavioral and 
      neurophysiological findings from this first study demonstrate the benefits of 
      brief digital mindfulness and compassion training for health care professionals 
      and compel the scale-up of the digital intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people with chronic fatigue syndrome 
      still experiencing excessive fatigue after cognitive behaviour therapy: a pilot 
      randomized study.
PG  - 107-17
LID - 10.1002/cpp.793 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for chronic fatigue 
      syndrome (CFS; sometimes known as myalgic encephalomyelitis). However, only a 
      minority of patients fully recover after CBT; thus, methods for improving 
      treatment outcomes are required. This pilot study concerned a mindfulness-based 
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention adapted for people with CFS who were still 
      experiencing excessive fatigue after CBT. The study aimed to investigate the 
      acceptability of this new intervention and the feasibility of conducting a 
      larger-scale randomized trial in the future. Preliminary efficacy analyses were 
      also undertaken. Participants were randomly allocated to MBCT or waiting list. 
      Sixteen MBCT participants and 19 waiting-list participants completed the study, 
      with the intervention being delivered in two separate groups. Acceptability, 
      engagement and participant-rated helpfulness of the intervention were high. 
      Analysis of covariance controlling for pre-treatment scores indicated that, at 
      post-treatment, MBCT participants reported lower levels of fatigue (the primary 
      clinical outcome) than the waiting-list group. Similarly, there were significant 
      group differences in fatigue at 2-month follow-up, and when the MBCT group was 
      followed up to 6 months post-treatment, these improvements were maintained. The 
      MBCT group also had superior outcomes on measures of impairment, depressed mood, 
      catastrophic thinking about fatigue, all-or-nothing behavioural responses, 
      unhelpful beliefs about emotions, mindfulness and self-compassion. In conclusion, 
      MBCT is a promising and acceptable additional intervention for people still 
      experiencing excessive fatigue after CBT for CFS, which should be investigated in 
      a larger randomized controlled trial. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Only about 30% of 
      people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) recover after cognitive behaviour 
      therapy (CBT); thus, methods for improving treatment outcomes are needed. This is 
      the first pilot randomized study to demonstrate that a mindfulness-based 
      intervention was associated with reduced fatigue and other benefits for people 
      with CFS who were still experiencing excessive fatigue after a course of CBT. 
      Levels of acceptability, engagement in the intervention and rated helpfulness 
      were high. A larger-scale randomized controlled trial is required.

TI  - Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention Program as an Adjunct to 
      the Standard Treatment for Smoking: A Pragmatic Design Pilot Study.
PG  - 1605-1613
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntaa057 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Posttreatment relapse is a major roadblock to stemming the global 
      epidemic of tobacco-related illness. This article presents results from a pilot 
      trial evaluating the feasibility and initial efficacy of Mindfulness-Based 
      Relapse Prevention (MBRP) as an adjunct to standard relapse prevention treatment 
      (ST) for smoking cessation. AIMS AND METHODS: Smokers (n = 86) in the maintenance 
      phase of treatment were randomized to receive either ST plus MBRP (MBRP) (n = 44) 
      or ST alone (ST) (n = 42). Data were collected at baseline and at 4-, 12-, and 
      24-week follow-up points. We evaluated the feasibility of the protocol with 
      frequency analysis, and the efficacy with both intention to treat and complete 
      case analyses of the effects of MBRP on abstinence. Secondary outcomes included 
      mindfulness, craving, depression, anxiety, and positive/negative affect. RESULTS: 
      High adherence suggested MBRP is acceptable and feasible. Participants in the 
      MBRP group reported increases in mindfulness (M = -7.833, p = .016), and 
      reductions in craving (M = 17.583, p = .01) compared with the ST group. Intention 
      to treat analysis found that, compared with MBRP (36.4%), ST (57.1%) showed 
      trend-level superiority in abstinence at Week 4 (Prevalence Ratio = 0.63, p = 
      .06); however at Week 24, the ST group (14.3%) demonstrated a twofold greater 
      decrease in abstinence, compared with the MBRP group (20.1%) (Prevalence Ratio = 
      2.25, p = .08). Therefore, the MBRP group maintained a higher abstinence rate for 
      longer. Reported effects were greater in the complete case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MBRP holds promise for preventing relapse after aided tobacco quit attempts. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest that MBRP is acceptable, feasible, and valued by 
      participants. At 24-week follow-up, there was a large effect size and a 
      statistical trend toward fewer MBRP patients relapsing compared with ST patients. 
      MBRP conferred ancillary benefits including reductions in craving and increases 
      in levels of mindfulness. MBRP for tobacco cessation is highly promising and 
      merits further research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov. IDENTIFIER:

TI  - Testing the Efficacy of a Brief, Self-Guided Mindfulness Ecological Momentary 
      Intervention on Emotion Regulation and Self-Compassion in Social Anxiety 
      Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e53712
LID - 10.2196/53712 [doi]
LID - e53712
AB  - BACKGROUND: Theories propose that brief, mobile, self-guided mindfulness 
      ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) could enhance emotion regulation (ER) 
      and self-compassion. Such changes are posited to be mechanisms of change. 
      However, rigorous tests of these theories have not been conducted. OBJECTIVE: In 
      this assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, we aimed to 
      test these theories in social anxiety disorder (SAD). METHODS: Participants with 
      SAD (defined as having a prerandomization cut-off score ≥20 on the Social Phobia 
      Inventory self-report) were randomized to a 14-day fully self-guided MEMI 
      (96/191, 50.3%) or self-monitoring app (95/191, 49.7%) arm. They completed 
      web-based self-reports of 6 clinical outcome measures at prerandomization, 15-day 
      postintervention (administered the day after the intervention ended), and 1-month 
      follow-up time points. ER and self-compassion were assessed at preintervention 
      and 7-day midintervention time points. Multilevel modeling determined the 
      efficacy of MEMI on ER and self-compassion domains from pretrial to 
      midintervention time points. Bootstrapped parallel multilevel mediation analysis 
      examined the mediating role of pretrial to midintervention ER and self-compassion 
      domains on the efficacy of MEMI on 6 clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Participants 
      demonstrated strong compliance, with 78% (149/191) engaging in at least 80% of 
      the MEMI and self-monitoring prompts. MEMI was more efficacious than the 
      self-monitoring app in decreasing ER goal-directed behavior difficulties 
      (between-group Cohen d=-0.24) and lack of emotional clarity (Cohen d=0.16) and 
      increasing self-compassion social connectedness (Cohen d=0.19), nonidentification 
      with emotions (Cohen d=0.16), and self-kindness (Cohen d=0.19) from pretrial to 
      midintervention time points. The within-group effect sizes from pretrial to 
      midintervention were larger in the MEMI arm than in the self-monitoring app arm 
      (ER goal-directed behavior difficulties: Cohen d=-0.73 vs -0.29, lack of 
      emotional clarity: Cohen d=-0.39 vs -0.21, self-compassion domains of social 
      connectedness: Cohen d=0.45 vs 0.19, nonidentification with emotions: Cohen 
      d=0.63 vs 0.48, and self-kindness: Cohen d=0.36 vs 0.10). Self-monitoring, but 
      not MEMI, alleviated ER emotional awareness issues (between-group Cohen d=0.11 
      and within-group: Cohen d=-0.29 vs -0.13) and reduced self-compassion 
      acknowledging shared human struggles (between-group Cohen d=0.26 and 
      within-group: Cohen d=-0.23 vs 0.13). No ER and self-compassion domains were 
      mediators of the effect of MEMI on SAD symptoms (P=.07-<.99), generalized anxiety 
      symptoms (P=.16-.98), depression severity (P=.20-.94), repetitive negative 
      thinking (P=.12-.96), and trait mindfulness (P=.18-.99) from pretrial to 
      postintervention time points. Similar nonsignificant mediation effects emerged 
      for all of these clinical outcomes from pretrial to 1-month follow-up time points 
      (P=.11-.98). CONCLUSIONS: Brief, fully self-guided, mobile MEMIs efficaciously 
      increased specific self-compassion domains and decreased ER difficulties 
      associated with goal pursuit and clarity of emotions from pretrial to 
      midintervention time points. Higher-intensity MEMIs may be required to pinpoint 
      the specific change mechanisms in ER and self-compassion domains of SAD. TRIAL

TI  - A parallel-group, randomized controlled trial into the effectiveness of 
      Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living (MBCL) compared to treatment-as-usual in 
      recurrent depression: Trial design and protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce 
      the risk of relapse in patients with recurrent depression, but relapse rates 
      remain high. To further improve outcome for this group of patients, follow-up 
      interventions may be needed. Compassion training focuses explicitly on developing 
      self-compassion, one of the putative working mechanisms of MBCT. No previous 
      research has been done on the effectiveness of compassion training following MBCT 
      in patients with recurrent depression. AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of 
      Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living (MBCL) in reducing (residual) depressive 
      symptoms in patients with recurrent depression who previously participated in 
      MBCT. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial comparing MBCL in addition to 
      treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only, in patients suffering from recurrent 
      depressive episodes who completed an MBCT course in the past. Assessments will 
      take place at baseline, post-treatment and at six months follow-up. After the 
      control period, patients randomized to the TAU condition will be offered MBCL as 
      well. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure is severity of depressive 
      symptoms according to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at 
      post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures are presence or absence of DSM-IV 
      depressive disorder, rumination, self-compassion, mindfulness skills, positive 
      affect, quality of life, experiential avoidance and fear of self-compassion. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the 
      effectiveness of compassion training following MBCT in a recurrently depressed 
      population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02059200, registered 30

      perinatal period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Positive maternal mental health during the perinatal period 
      contributes to general well-being and positive emotional bonds with the child, 
      encouraging an optimal developmental trajectory. Online interventions to enhance 
      maternal well-being and develop coping skills, such as meditation-based 
      interventions, can be a low-cost way to improve mother and child outcomes. 
      However, this depends on end-user engagement. To date, there is limited evidence 
      about women's willingness to engage and preferences for online programmes. 
      OBJECTIVES: This study explored pregnant women's attitudes towards and likelihood 
      to undertake minimal online well-being training programmes (mindfulness, 
      self-compassion, or general relaxation), engagement barriers and enablers, and 
      programme structure preferences. DESIGN: A mixed methods triangulation design was 
      undertaken using a validating quantitative model. Quantile regressions were 
      applied to the quantitative data. Content analysis was undertaken for the 
      qualitative data. METHODS: Consenting pregnant women (n = 151) were randomized 
      equally to read about three online programme types. Participants were sent an 
      information leaflet, tested by a consumer panel prior to distribution. RESULTS: 
      Participants generally held positive attitudes about all three types of 
      interventions, with no statistically significant differences in preferences 
      between programme types. Participants appreciated the importance of mental health 
      and were receptive to fostering skills to support their emotional well-being and 
      stress management. The most frequent perceived barriers were lack of time, 
      tiredness, and forgetfulness. Programme structure preferences indicated one to 
      two modules per week, less than 15 min in duration, and over 4 weeks. Programme 
      functionality, such as regular reminders and easy accessibility, is important to 
      end users. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the importance of determining 
      participant preferences in designing and communicating engaging interventions for 
      perinatal women. This research contributes to the understanding of 
      population-based interventions that can be provided as simple, scalable, 
      cost-effective, and home-based activities in pregnancy for the benefit of 
      individuals, their families, and society more broadly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Yoga has several mechanisms that make it a promising treatment for 
      depression and anxiety, including physical activity, behavioural activation, and 
      mindfulness. Following positive outcomes from adapted CBT interventions 
      incorporating mindfulness-based practices, this study explored the effects of a 
      therapeutic yoga program as an adjunct to group-based CBT for depression or 
      anxiety. METHODS: This was a pragmatic preference trial involving adults 
      diagnosed with depression or anxiety in a regional primary mental healthcare 
      service (n = 59), comparing transdiagnostic group CBT (n = 27) with 
      transdiagnostic group CBT combined with an adjunct therapeutic yoga program 
      (n = 32). A preference recruitment design allowed eligible participants (n = 35) 
      to self-select into the adjunct program. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 
      (DASS) was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months follow up. 
      RESULTS: CBT + Yoga was an acceptable alternative to CBT alone. Significant 
      reductions were observed in total DASS scores and the 3 subscales of the DASS for 
      both groups, however CBT + Yoga showed significantly lower depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms post-intervention, compared to CBT alone. CBT + Yoga also showed 
      sustained reductions in depressive symptoms over three-months, and more rapid 
      reductions in depressive symptoms, compared to CBT alone. LIMITATIONS: These 
      findings should be considered preliminary due to the moderate sample size, with a 
      rigorous randomised control trial necessary to definitively support the 
      integration of yoga within mental health care to augment the benefits and uptake 
      of transdiagnostic CBT for depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Complementing 
      other mindfulness-based practices, therapeutic yoga shows promise as an adjunct 
      to transdiagnostic CBT.

TI  - Cost-utility and biological underpinnings of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
      (MBSR) versus a psychoeducational programme (FibroQoL) for fibromyalgia: a 
      12-month randomised controlled trial (EUDAIMON study).
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/s12906-016-1068-2 [doi]
LID - 81
AB  - BACKGROUND: The EUDAIMON study focuses on fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a 
      prevalent chronic condition characterized by pain, fatigue, cognitive problems 
      and distress. According to recent reviews and meta-analyses, Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with 
      FMS. The measurement of biomarkers as part of the analysis of MBSR effects would 
      help to identify the neurobiological underpinnings of MBSR and increase our 
      knowledge of FMS pathophysiology. The main objectives of this 12-month RCT are: 
      firstly, to examine the effectiveness and cost-utility for FMS patients of MBSR 
      as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU + the psychoeducational 
      programme FibroQoL, and versus TAU only; secondly, to examine pre-post 
      differences in brain structure and function, as well as levels of specific 
      inflammatory markers in the three study arms and; thirdly, to analyse the role of 
      some psychological variables as mediators of 12-month clinical outcomes. METHODS: 
      Effectiveness, cost-utility, and neurobiological analyses performed alongside a 
      12-month RCT. The participants will be 180 adult patients with FMS recruited at 
      the Sant Joan de Déu hospital (St. Boi de Llobregat, Spain), randomly allocated 
      to one of the three study arms: TAU + MBSR vs. TAU + FibroQol vs. TAU. A 
      comprehensive assessment to collect functional, quality of life, distress, costs, 
      and psychological variables will be conducted pre-, post-intervention, and at 
      12-month post-intervention. Fifty per cent of study participants will be 
      evaluated at pre- and post-treatment using Voxel-Based Morphometry, Diffusion 
      Tensor Imaging, pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labeling, and resting state fMRI. 
      A cytokine multiplex kit of high-sensitivity will be applied (cytokines IL-6, 
      IL-8, IL-10 + high-sensitivity CRP test). DISCUSSION: The findings obtained from 
      this RCT will indicate whether MBSR is potentially cost-effective for FMS and 
      contribute to knowledge of any brain and inflammatory changes associated with 
      MBSR in FMS patients. Specifically, we will determine whether there are 
      morphometric and functional changes associated with participation in MBSR in 
      brain regions related to meta-awareness, body awareness, memory 
      consolidation-reconsolidation, emotion regulation and in networks postulated to 
      underpin the sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative and 
      affective-motivational aspects of the pain experience. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions have been increasingly applied to 
      treat eating-related problems ranging from obesity to eating disorders. Yet few 
      studies have empirically examined the mechanisms of a mindful approach to eating. 
      The current studies examine the potential of brief mindfulness instructions to 
      enhance the psychological and behavioral dimensions of eating. METHODS: In three 
      experiments (total N = 319 undergraduates), we examined whether brief mindfulness 
      instructions would enhance the positive sensory experience involved in tasting 
      food as well as healthy eating behaviors. RESULTS: Relative to distraction 
      control instructions, the first two studies demonstrated that brief mindfulness 
      instructions increased the enjoyment of a commonly pleasurable food (chocolate; 
      Study 1), and a food with generally more mixed associations (raisins; Study 2). 
      The third study replicated and extended these findings to show that brief 
      mindfulness instructions also led to lower calorie consumption of unhealthy food 
      relative to distracted or no-instruction control conditions, an effect mediated 
      by greater eating enjoyment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated the power of 
      brief mindfulness instructions to positively impact both health-relevant behavior 
      and sensory experience associated with eating food. Implications for both theory 
      and clinical applications of mindfulness are discussed.

TI  - Latent Profile Analysis of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire in a Sample 
      With a History of Recurrent Depression.
PG  - 149-163
LID - 10.1177/1073191117715114 [doi]
AB  - Extending previous research, we applied latent profile analysis in a sample of 
      adults with a history of recurrent depression to identify subgroups with distinct 
      response profiles on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and understand how 
      these relate to psychological functioning. The sample was randomly divided into 
      two subsamples to first examine the optimal number of latent profiles (test 
      sample; n = 343) and then validate the identified solution (validation sample; n 
      = 340). In both test and validation samples, a four-profile solution was revealed 
      where two profiles mapped broadly onto those previously identified in nonclinical 
      samples: "high mindfulness" and "nonjudgmentally aware." Two additional 
      subgroups, "moderate mindfulness" and "very low mindfulness," were observed. 
      "High mindfulness" was associated with the most adaptive psychological 
      functioning and "very low mindfulness" with the least adaptive. In most people 
      with recurrent depression, mindfulness skills are expressed evenly across 
      different domains. However, in a small minority a meaningful and replicable 
      uneven profile indicating nonjudgmental awareness is observable. Current findings 
      require replication and future research should examine the extent to which 
      profiles change from periods of wellness to illness in people with recurrent 
      depression and how profiles are influenced by exposure to mindfulness-based 
      intervention.

TI  - A randomised study to evaluate the potential added value of shared meditation 
      involving people with cancer, health professionals and third persons compared to 
      meditation conducted with patients only: design of the Implic-2 protocol.
PG  - 1097
LID - 10.1186/s12885-024-12521-1 [doi]
LID - 1097
AB  - BACKGROUND: In oncology, the suffering of patients and the burnout of health 
      professionals are key issues. Mindfulness meditation is a holistic approach that 
      can help to improve well-being. While numerous studies have shown the benefits of 
      meditation for both patients and health professionals, the added value of 
      offering shared meditation to groups of patients, health professionals and third 
      persons has not been assessed. Beyond strengthening the relationship between 
      carers and patients, opening up meditation sessions to third parties (neither 
      carers nor patients) enables patients to escape the stigma of their illness. We 
      previously conducted a pilot study that validated the feasibility and the 
      relevance of shared meditation with a specifically designed programme. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: IMPLIC-2 is a two-arm randomised study designed to assess the 
      added value of this meditation programme (optimised following the pilot study), 
      particularly for cancer patients (our target population). People motivated to 
      follow the programme, without previous regular practice of meditation and able to 
      participate in the sessions are eligible. The study will include 96 participants: 
      16 health professionals, 16 third persons and 64 patients. The latter will be 
      randomized in two arms: the experimental arm ("Shared" meditation) consisting of 
      4 mixed groups of 8 patients, 4 health professionals and 4 third parties, and the 
      control arm ("Patient" meditation) consisting of 2 groups of 16 patients. 
      Validated questionnaires will be used to measure the effects of the programme, 
      notably in terms of quality of life, perceived stress, feelings of self-efficacy, 
      qualities of mindfulness and self-compassion, and carers' burn-out. Participants' 
      perception of a change in their quality of life and satisfaction will be measured 
      at the end of the programme. A complementary qualitative focus-group approach 
      will be used to optimise implementation of the programme beyond the study. 
      DISCUSSION: The well-being of oncology patients would be improved. Dealing with 
      overworked carers would have a beneficial impact on the way they interact with 
      patients. In addition, encounters between the three types of population will 
      allow otherness to be viewed differently and alleviate suffering by promoting 
      collective humanity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06041607, registered: 09/18/2023.

TI  - An adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction program for elders in a continuing

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an 
      adapted 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program for elders in a 
      continuing care community. This mixed-methods study used both quantitative and 
      qualitative measures. A randomized waitlist control design was used for the 
      quantitative aspect of the study. Thirty-nine elderly were randomized to MBSR (n 
      = 20) or a waitlist control group (n = 19), mean age was 82 years. Both groups 
      completed pre-post measures of health-related quality of life, acceptance and 
      psychological flexibility, facets of mindfulness, self-compassion, and 
      psychological distress. A subset of MBSR participants completed qualitative 
      interviews. MBSR participants showed significantly greater improvement in 
      acceptance and psychological flexibility and in role limitations due to physical 
      health. In the qualitative interviews, MBSR participants reported increased 
      awareness, less judgment, and greater self-compassion. Study results demonstrate 
      the feasibility and potential effectiveness of an adapted MBSR program in 
      promoting mind-body health for elders.

TI  - A RCT Comparing Daily Mindfulness Meditations, Biofeedback Exercises, and Daily 
      Physical Exercise on Attention Control, Executive Functioning, Mindful Awareness, 
      Self-Compassion, and Worrying in Stressed Young Adults.

AB  - Our Western society is characterized by multitasking, competition, and constant 
      time pressure. Negative effects of stress for the individual (anxiety, 
      depression, somatic complaints) and for organizations and society (costs due to 
      work absence) are very high. Thus, time-efficient self-help interventions to 
      address these issues are necessary. This study assessed the effects of daily 
      mindfulness meditations (MM) versus daily heart rate variability biofeedback 
      (HRV-BF) and daily physical exercise (PE) on attention control, executive 
      functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying. Young adults 
      (n = 75, age range 18 to 40) with elevated stress levels were randomized to MM, 
      HRV-BF, or PE, and measurements were taken at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. 
      Interventions in all three groups were self-guided and lasted for 5 weeks. 
      Generalized estimating equation analyses showed that overall, all three 
      interventions were effective and did not differ from each other. However, 
      practice time differed between groups, with participants in the PE group 
      practicing much more than participants in the other two groups. Therefore, 
      additional analyses were carried out in two subsamples. The optimal dose sample 
      included only those participants who practiced for at least 70 % of the total 
      prescribed time. In the equal dose sample, home practice intensity was equal for 
      all three groups. Again, the effects of the three interventions did not differ. 
      In conclusion, MM, HRV-BF, and PE are all effective self-help methods to improve 
      attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and 
      worrying, and mindfulness meditation was not found to be more effective than 
      HRV-biofeedback or physical exercise for these cognitive processes.

      Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy Intervention for Headache Pain.
PG  - 420-7

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is often assumed that psychosocial pain treatments work because of 
      specific active components of the intervention. The degree to which common 
      factors may contribute to improved pain outcomes is not well researched. The 
      purpose of this study was to examine patient-related and therapist-related common 
      factors during a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for headache pain 
      trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a parallel 
      group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial in which MBCT was compared with a 
      control. A series of linear regression models and 1 bootstrap mediation model 
      were conducted with the sample of participants that completed MBCT (N=21). 
      RESULTS: In-session participant engagement was positively associated with 
      treatment dose indicators of session attendance (P=0.038) and at-home meditation 
      practice (P=0.027). Therapist adherence and quality were both significant 
      predictors of posttreatment client satisfaction (P=0.038 and 0.034, 
      respectively). Therapist appropriateness was not significantly associated with 
      any of the variables of interest (P>0.05). Baseline pain intensity was positively 
      associated with pretreatment expectations and motivations (P=0.049) and working 
      alliance (P=0.048), and working alliance significantly predicted posttreatment 
      patient satisfaction (P<0.001). Higher pretreatment expectations and motivation 
      significantly predicted greater improvement in pretreatment to posttreatment 
      change in pain interference (P=0.016); however, this relation was fully mediated 
      by baseline pain intensity (P<0.05). DISCUSSION: Common factors play an important 
      role in improving pain outcomes and patient satisfaction during a MBCT for 
      headache pain intervention. Stimulating positive pretreatment expectations and 
      patient motivation, as well as building strong rapport is an important component 
      of treatment success.

TI  - The effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction program on the mental health of 
      family caregivers: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 45-53
LID - 10.1159/000353278 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caregivers of people with chronic conditions are more likely than 
      non-caregivers to have depression and emotional problems. Few studies have 
      examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in 
      improving their mental well-being. METHODS: Caregivers of persons with chronic 
      conditions who scored 7 or above in the Caregiver Strain Index were randomly 
      assigned to the 8-week MBSR group (n = 70) or the self-help control group (n = 
      71). Validated instruments were used to assess the changes in depressive and 
      anxiety symptoms, quality of life, self-efficacy, self-compassion and 
      mindfulness. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at the 
      3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Compared to the participants in the control group, 
      participants in the MBSR group had a significantly greater decrease in depressive 
      symptoms at post-intervention and at 3 months post-intervention (p < 0.01). The 
      improvement in state anxiety symptoms was significantly greater among 
      participants in the MBSR group than those of the control group at 
      post-intervention (p = 0.007), although this difference was not statistically 
      significant at 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.084). There was also a 
      statistically significant larger increase in self-efficacy (controlling negative 
      thoughts; p = 0.041) and mindfulness (p = 0.001) among participants in the MBSR 
      group at the 3-month follow-up compared to the participants in the control group. 
      No statistically significant group effects (MBSR vs. control) were found in 
      perceived stress, quality of life or self-compassion. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR appears 
      to be a feasible and acceptable intervention to improve mental health among 
      family caregivers with significant care burden, although further studies that 
      include an active control group are needed to make the findings more conclusive.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological disorder characterized 
      by dysregulation across multiple domains. While selected mindfulness-based 
      interventions are effective in addressing symptoms of BPD, less is known 
      regarding the effects of engaging in brief mindfulness practices on affective 
      correlates of BPD. The present study investigated the effects of engaging in 
      brief, daily mindfulness practice in a sample of young adults with elevated BPD 
      symptoms. Ninety-two participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 2 weeks 
      of daily mindfulness meditation or relaxation practice (active control), or to a 
      no-practice control condition. Participants completed measures assessing 
      depression, anxiety, stress, shame, difficulties with emotion regulation, trait 
      mindfulness, and self-compassion before and after the practice period. Compared 
      to the no-practice control condition, mindfulness practice resulted in 
      significant improvements in trait mindfulness and self-compassion, whereas 
      relaxation practice led to reductions in emotion regulation difficulties. No 
      significant differences were found on any of the other outcomes between the 
      mindfulness and relaxation conditions. The findings suggest that while both 
      mindfulness and relaxation-based practices are effective in targeting selected 
      transdiagnostic processes associated with BPD, more intensive interventions may 
      be required for the practices to induce changes at the level of psychological 
      symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions have shown to reduce psychological 
      distress in cancer patients. The accessibility of mindfulness-based interventions 
      for cancer patients could be further improved by providing mindfulness using an 
      individual internet-based format. The aim of this study is to test the 
      effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) group intervention 
      for cancer patients in comparison with individual internet-based MBCT and 
      treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS/DESIGN: A three-armed multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial comparing group-based MBCT to individual internet-based MBCT and 
      TAU in cancer patients who suffer from at least mild psychological distress 
      (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) ≥ 11). Measurements will be 
      conducted prior to randomization (baseline), post-treatment and at 3 months and 9 
      months post-treatment. Participants initially allocated to TAU are subsequently 
      randomized to either group- or individual internet-based MBCT and will receive a 
      second baseline measurement after 3 months. Thus, the three-armed comparison will 
      have a time span of approximately 3 months. The two-armed intervention comparison 
      includes a 9-month follow-up and will also consist of participants randomized to 
      the intervention after TAU. Primary outcome will be post-treatment psychological 
      distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes are fear of cancer recurrence (Fear of Cancer 
      Recurrence Inventory), rumination (Rumination and Reflection Questionnaire), 
      positive mental health (Mental Health Continuum - Short Form), and 
      cost-effectiveness (health-related quality of life (EuroQol -5D and Short 
      Form-12) and health care usage (Trimbos and iMTA questionnaire on Costs 
      associated with Psychiatric illness). Potential predictors: DSM-IV-TR 
      mood/anxiety disorders (SCID-I) and neuroticism (NEO-Five Factor Inventory) will 
      be measured. Mediators of treatment effect: mindfulness skills, (Five-Facets of 
      Mindfulness Questionnaire- Short Form), working alliance (Working Alliance 
      Inventory) and group cohesion (Group Cohesion Questionnaire) will also be 
      measured. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide valuable information on the 
      clinical and cost-effectiveness of group versus internet-based MBCT versus TAU 
      for distressed cancer patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often 
      present with a lifelong pattern of core symptoms that is associated with 
      impairments of functioning in daily life. This has a substantial personal and 
      economic impact. In clinical practice there is a high need for additional or 
      alternative interventions for existing treatments, usually consisting of 
      pharmacotherapy and/or psycho-education. Although previous studies show 
      preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in 
      reducing ADHD symptoms and improving executive functioning, these studies have 
      methodological limitations. This study will take account of these limitations and 
      will examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in 
      further detail. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised 
      controlled trial will be conducted in N = 120 adults with ADHD. Patients will be 
      randomised to MBCT in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. 
      Assessments will take place at baseline and at three, six and nine months after 
      baseline. Primary outcome measure will be severity of ADHD symptoms rated by a 
      blinded clinician. Secondary outcome measures will be self-reported ADHD 
      symptoms, executive functioning, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, positive 
      mental health and general functioning. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis 
      will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This trial will offer valuable information about 
      the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MBCT in addition to TAU compared to TAU 
      alone in adults swith ADHD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02463396.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the specific effects of mindfulness-based stress 
      reduction (MBSR) for urban youth by comparing it with an active control program, 
      designed to control for time, positive peer-group experience, and positive adult 
      instructor. METHODS: Patients between the ages of 13-21 years who received 
      primary pediatric care at our urban outpatient clinic were eligible for study 
      participation. Those who were interested were consented and randomly assigned to 
      an eight-week program of MBSR or Healthy Topics (HT), a health education 
      curriculum. To increase sensitivity to outcomes of interest, mixed methods were 
      used to assess psychological symptoms, coping, and program experience. Analysis 
      of variance and regression modeling were used; interviews were audio-taped, 
      transcribed, and coded for key themes. RESULTS: A total of 43 (26 MBSR, 17 HT) 
      youths attended one or more sessions, of whom 35 [20 MBSR (77%), 15 HT (88%)] 
      attended the majority of the sessions and were considered completers. Program 
      completers were African American, 80% female, with average age of 15.0 years. 
      Statistical analysis of survey data did not identify significant post-program 
      differences between groups. Qualitative data show comparable positive experiences 
      in both programs, but specific differences related to MBSR participants׳ use of 
      mindfulness techniques to calm down and avoid conflicts, as well as descriptions 
      of internal processes and self-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an active 
      control program, MBSR did not result in statistically significant differences in 
      self-reported survey outcomes of interest but was associated with qualitative 
      outcomes of increased calm, conflict avoidance, self-awareness, and 
      self-regulation for urban youths. Importantly, based on qualitative results, the 
      HT program functioned as an effective active control for MBSR in this sample, 
      facilitating a more rigorous methodological approach to MBSR research in this 
      population. We believe the promising effects elucidated in the qualitative data 
      have the potential for positive affective and behavioral outcomes.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction delivered to 
      human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients in Iran: effects on CD4⁺ T 
      lymphocyte count and medical and psychological symptoms.
PG  - 620-7

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of 
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on biological and symptomatological 
      markers of health among human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients in 
      Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial design, data from 173 
      HIV+ patients (CD4 count > 250) not yet receiving antiretroviral therapy, who 
      participated in either an 8-week MBSR (n = 87) or a brief education and support 
      condition (n = 86) at the Imam Khomeini Hospital, were analyzed. Assessments 
      included CD4 count, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90R), and Medical Symptom 
      Checklist (MSCL) at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and at the 3-, 6-, 9-, 
      and 12-month follow-up periods. RESULTS: The treatment-adherent sample had a mean 
      (standard deviation) age of 35.1 (6.5) years and 69% were male. Linear 
      mixed-model estimates indicated that, in the MBSR condition, the mean CD4 count 
      increased from baseline up to 9 months after treatment and then returned to 
      baseline level at 12 months. Improvements in mean SCL-90R (up to 6 months) and 
      MSCL (up to 12 months) scores were observed for the MBSR condition, whereas 
      education and support condition scores remained the same over time; however, only 
      MSCL improvements significantly differed between groups and these changes lasted 
      up to the final assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that among 
      treatment-adherent Iranian HIV+ patients not yet receiving antiretroviral drug 
      treatment, MBSR seems to have the strongest potential to improve self-reported 
      medical symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials:

TI  - Effectiveness of Caregiver Training in Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior 
      Support (MBPBS) vs. Training-as-Usual (TAU): A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1549
LID - 1549
AB  - Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) 
      often end up having their medical and psychological well-being compromised due to 
      the stressful nature of caregiving, especially when those in their care engage in 
      aggressive behavior. In this study, we provided caregivers with mindfulness-based 
      training to enable them to better manage their psychological well-being and, 
      through this, to also enhance specific indices of quality of life of the 
      individuals in their care. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate in 
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the comparative effectiveness of 
      Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and Training-as-Usual (TAU) 
      for caregivers in a congregate care facility for individuals with severe and 
      profound IDD. The comparative effects of the two training conditions were 
      assessed in terms of caregiver variables care recipient variable (number of 
      aggressive events), and agency variables Results showed that MBPBS was 
      significantly more effective than TAU in enabling the caregivers to manage their 
      perceived psychological stress, and to reduce the use of physical restraints and 
      stat medications for aggressive behavior of the individuals in their care. In 
      addition, there were significant reductions in aggressive events by the 
      individuals in their care, 1:1 staffing of individuals with aggressive behavior, 
      and staff turnover. Furthermore, the MBPBS training was significantly more 
      cost-effective than the TAU training. If replicated in future RCT studies, MBPBS 
      may provide an effective means of enhancing socially acceptable bidirectional 
      engagement of caregivers and care recipients within a person-centered context.

TI  - The effect of mindfulness meditation on cough reflex sensitivity.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1136/thx.2009.116723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is common, and medical treatment can be ineffective. 
      Mindfulness is a psychological intervention that aims to teach moment-to-moment 
      non-judgemental awareness of thoughts, feelings and sensations. METHOD: 30 
      healthy subjects and 30 patients with chronic cough were studied in two 
      sequential trials. For both studies, cough reflex sensitivity to citric acid (C5) 
      was measured on two occasions, with urge to cough rated following each 
      inhalation; between challenges subjects were randomised to (1) no intervention, 
      (2) mindfulness or (3) no intervention but modified cough challenge (subjects 
      suppress coughing). For the healthy volunteers, measures were 1 h apart and 
      mindfulness was practised for 15 min. For the patients with chronic cough 
      measures were 1 week apart and mindfulness was practised daily for 30 min. 
      RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, median change (interquartile range (IQR)) in 
      cough reflex sensitivity (logC5) for no intervention, mindfulness and suppression 
      was +1.0 (0.0 to +1.3), +2.0 (+1.0 to +3.0) and +3.0 (+2.8 to +3.0) doubling 
      concentrations (p = 0.003); there were significant reductions for both 
      mindfulness (p = 0.043) and suppression (p = 0.002) over no intervention. In 
      patients with cough, median change (IQR) in logC5 for no intervention, 
      mindfulness training and voluntary suppression was 0.0 (-1.0 to +1.0), +1.0 (-0.3 
      to +1.0) and +1.0 (+1.0 to +2.0) doubling concentrations (p = 0.046); there was a 
      significant reduction for suppression (p = 0.02) but not mindfulness (p = 0.35). 
      Urge to cough did not change after mindfulness compared with control in either 
      healthy subjects (p = 0.33) or those with chronic cough (p = 0.47). CONCLUSION: 
      Compared with control, mindfulness decreased cough reflex sensitivity in healthy 
      volunteers, but did not alter cough threshold in patients with chronic cough. 
      Both groups were able to suppress cough responses to citric acid inhalation.

TI  - LessStress - how to reduce stress in school: evaluation of a universal stress 
      prevention in schools: study protocol of a cluster-randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06970-x [doi]
LID - 44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is detrimental to health, and children and young 
      people have had to cope with significantly more stress since the start of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, stress at school and in relation to learning is 
      a major problem in this age group. Studies in Germany have indicated that the 
      pandemic has led to a reduced quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk for 
      psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Schools are an ideal setting 
      for interventions against stress, which is one of the strongest predictors for 
      the development of psychosocial problems. The present study seeks to address 
      stress by means of a short prevention training programme in schools, including 
      emotion regulation, mindfulness, and self-compassion. In addition to information 
      material for self-study, students should have the opportunity to actively deal 
      with the topic of stress and develop coping strategies within a short space of 
      time. In contrast to very long stress reduction programmes that often last 
      several weeks, the programme is delivered in just 90 min. METHODS: The 
      effectiveness of the short and economical prevention programme LessStress will be 
      examined in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) encompassing 1894 
      students. At several measurement time points, students from two groups 
      (intervention and control) will be asked about their subjectively perceived 
      stress levels, among other aspects. Due to the clustered nature of the data, 
      mainly multilevel analyses will be performed. DISCUSSION: In Germany, there are 
      no nationwide universal prevention programmes for students against stress in 
      schools, and this gap has become more evident since the outbreak of the pandemic. 
      Universal stress prevention in schools may be a starting point to promote 
      resilience. By dealing with stress in a healthy way, mental health can be 
      strengthened and maintained. Moreover, to reach at-risk students at an early 
      stage, we advocate for a stronger networking between child psychiatry and 
      schools. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) DRKS00025721

AB  - This paper explores the feasibility of a brief Mindfulness with Metta Training 
      Program (MMTP), targeting the enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion in a 
      retreat format, as a means of increasing resilience in human services 
      professionals. In this randomised control trial, 44 human services professionals 
      were randomly allocated either to a MMTP retreat group or to a control group. 
      Following the MMTP intervention, no significant differences between the retreat 
      and control groups were found on resilience, mindfulness and self-compassion 
      variables. However, significant improvements were observed over time for the 
      retreat group for mindfulness and self-compassion at one and four months and for 
      resilience at four-months post MMTP intervention. The results of this pilot study 
      show that MMTP in a retreat format is a promising method of increasing 
      resilience, mindfulness and self-compassion in human services professionals.

TI  - Mindfulness Training Improves Quality of Life and Reduces Depression and Anxiety 
      Symptoms Among Police Officers: Results From the POLICE Study-A Multicenter 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 624876

AB  - Background: Police officers' high-stress levels and its deleterious consequences 
      are raising awareness to an epidemic of mental health problems and quality of 
      life (QoL) impairment. There is a growing evidence that mindfulness-based 
      interventions are efficacious to promote mental health and well-being among 
      high-stress occupations. Methods: The POLICE study is a multicenter randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) with three assessment points (baseline, post-intervention, 
      and 6-month follow-up) where police officers were randomized to mindfulness-based 
      health promotion (MBHP) (n = 88) or a waiting list (n = 82). This article focuses 
      on QoL, depression and anxiety symptoms, and religiosity outcomes. Mechanisms of 
      change and MBHP feasibility were evaluated. Results: Significant group × time 
      interaction was found for QoL, depression and anxiety symptoms, and 
      non-organizational religiosity. Between-group analysis showed that MBHP group 
      exhibited greater improvements in QoL, and depression and anxiety symptoms at 
      both post-intervention (QoL d = 0.69 to 1.01; depression d = 0.97; anxiety d = 
      0.73) and 6-month follow-up (QoL d = 0.41 to 0.74; depression d = 0.60; anxiety d 
      = 0.51), in addition to increasing non-organizational religiosity at 
      post-intervention (d = 0.31). Changes on self-compassion mediated the 
      relationship between group and pre-to-post changes for all QoL domains and 
      facets. Group effect on QoL overall health facet at post-intervention was 
      moderated by mindfulness trait and spirituality changes. Conclusion: MBHP is 
      feasible and efficacious to improve QoL, and depression and anxiety symptoms 
      among Brazilian officers. Results were maintained after 6 months. MBHP increased 
      non-organizational religiosity, although the effect was not sustained 6 months 
      later. To our knowledge, this is the first mindfulness-based intervention RCT to 
      empirically demonstrate these effects among police officers. Self-compassion, 
      mindfulness trait, and spirituality mechanisms of change are examined. Clinical 
      Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov. identifier: NCT03114605.

TI  - Impact of heartfulness meditation practice compared to the gratitude practices on 
      wellbeing and work engagement among healthcare professionals: Randomized trial.
PG  - e0304093

LID - e0304093
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Heartfulness meditation practice, compared to 
      Gratitude practice, leads to measurable changes in mental wellbeing among 
      healthcare providers across the US. METHOD: Participants were randomly assigned 
      to one of the following 6-week interventions: the trainer-guided virtual 
      Heartfulness meditation program or the podcast-based self-guided gratitude 
      practice group. The Professional Quality of Life Scale-5 (ProQOL-5) was used to 
      determine Compassion Satisfaction (CS) and risk for Burnout (BO) and secondary 
      traumatic stress (STS). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) was used to 
      assess vigor, dedication, and absorption at work. Outcomes were collected at 
      baseline and the end of the study period. Qualitative questions regarding the 
      experience of learning and practicing were also offered at the end of the six 
      weeks. RESULTS: The majority of participants were nurses (50%), followed by 
      allied healthcare professionals (37%) and physicians (13%) (N = 83). There was a 
      general trend towards increases in CS in the Heartfulness group compared to the 
      gratitude group. However, this was not statistically significant. Strong evidence 
      suggests there was a significant improvement in BO for the Heartfulness group 
      between Week 0 and Week 6 (p = 0.002), as well as STS (p = 0.0004) and vigor (p = 
      0.0392). Qualitative data analysis revealed that the subjects in the Heartfulness 
      arm reported improved sleep and decreased reactivity to stress. Subjects in the 
      gratitude arm reported improved mood and favorable results using gratitude 
      practices at home with family members. CONCLUSION: In our study, Heartfulness 
      meditation practice was associated with a significant improvement in burnout and 
      vigor at work, with a trend towards compassion satisfaction after six weeks 
      compared with gratitude practices. Qualitative analysis indicates the benefits of 
      both Heartfulness and Gratitude practices. Further randomized trials with a 
      larger sample size are needed to explore these science-based practices for the 
      wellbeing of healthcare workers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have identified different, but highly correlated 
      variables explaining the effects of mindfulness training. Many of them are 
      limited by tautological explanation. Under the framework of the mind-body 
      connection, mindfulness training cultivates body awareness and promotes 
      self-management of illness. Stagnation, a concept from Chinese medicine, may help 
      explain the mechanism of change in mindfulness training. METHODS: Individuals 
      with depressive and anxiety symptoms (n=82) were randomized to either a 
      Compassion-Mindfulness Therapy (C-MT) program or a waitlist control condition. 
      The effect of stagnation as a mediator was investigated for dependent variables 
      including depression, anxiety, and other physical and mental health variables. 
      MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stagnation, physical distress, daily 
      functioning, positive affect, negative affect. RESULTS: Compared with the 
      participants in the control group, those who completed C-MT demonstrated 
      significant decreases in depression, F(1, 78)=15.67, p<.001, anxiety, F(1, 
      78)=7.72, p<.001, stagnation, F(1, 78)=4.96, p<.001, and other body-mind-spirit 
      well-being measures. After entering the change in stagnation as the mediator, the 
      effect of treatment reduced: depression (.35-.22), anxiety (.33-.05), and same 
      patterns in other three secondary measures. The Sobel test was administered and 
      significant reductions between group and depression (z=2.18, p=.029), anxiety 
      (z=2.21, p=.027), and three secondary other measures (p<.05) were indicated. 
      CONCLUSION: The study provides initial support for the role of stagnation in 
      mediating changes in mindfulness training. It adds evidence to body-mind 
      nondualism and offers new possibilities in studying treatment process and change 
      mechanism.

      connections account for the upward spiral between positive emotions and vagal 
      tone.
PG  - 1123-32
LID - 10.1177/0956797612470827 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms underlying the association between positive emotions and physical 
      health remain a mystery. We hypothesize that an upward-spiral dynamic continually 
      reinforces the tie between positive emotions and physical health and that this 
      spiral is mediated by people's perceptions of their positive social connections. 
      We tested this overarching hypothesis in a longitudinal field experiment in which 
      participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group that self-generated 
      positive emotions via loving-kindness meditation or to a waiting-list control 
      group. Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions 
      relative to those in the control group, an effect moderated by baseline vagal 
      tone, a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions, in turn, 
      produced increases in vagal tone, an effect mediated by increased perceptions of 
      social connections. This experimental evidence identifies one 
      mechanism-perceptions of social connections-through which positive emotions build 
      physical health, indexed as vagal tone. Results suggest that positive emotions, 
      positive social connections, and physical health influence one another in a 
      self-sustaining upward-spiral dynamic.

TI  - Individual mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and cognitive behavior therapy for 
      treating depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes: results of a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2427-34
LID - 10.2337/dc13-2918 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is a common comorbidity of diabetes, undesirably affecting 
      patients' physical and mental functioning. Psychological interventions are 
      effective treatments for depression in the general population as well as in 
      patients with a chronic disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy 
      of individual mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and individual cognitive 
      behavior therapy (CBT) in comparison with a waiting-list control condition for 
      treating depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 94 outpatients with 
      diabetes and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II 
      [BDI-II] ≥14) were randomized to MBCT (n = 31), CBT (n = 32), or waiting list (n 
      = 31). All participants completed written questionnaires and interviews at pre- 
      and postmeasurement (3 months later). Primary outcome measure was severity of 
      depressive symptoms (BDI-II and Toronto Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). 
      Anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), well-being (Well-Being Index), 
      diabetes-related distress (Problem Areas In Diabetes), and HbA1c levels were 
      assessed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Results showed that participants 
      receiving MBCT and CBT reported significantly greater reductions in depressive 
      symptoms compared with patients in the waiting-list control condition 
      (respectively, P = 0.004 and P < 0.001; d = 0.80 and 1.00; clinically relevant 
      improvement 26% and 29% vs. 4%). Both interventions also had significant positive 
      effects on anxiety, well-being, and diabetes-related distress. No significant 
      effect was found on HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Both individual MBCT and CBT are 
      effective in improving a range of psychological symptoms in individuals with type 
      1 and type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Stress reduction through mindfulness meditation. Effects on psychological 
      symptomatology, sense of control, and spiritual experiences.
PG  - 97-106
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the effects of an 8-week stress reduction program 
      based on training in mindfulness meditation. Previous research efforts suggesting 
      this program may be beneficial in terms of reducing stress-related symptomatology 
      and helping patients cope with chronic pain have been limited by a lack of 
      adequate comparison control group. METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals who 
      volunteered to participate in the present study were randomized into either an 
      experimental group or a nonintervention control group. RESULTS: Following 
      participation, experimental subjects, when compared with controls, evidenced 
      significantly greater changes in terms of: (1) reductions in overall 
      psychological symptomatology; (2) increase in overall domain-specific sense of 
      control and utilization of an accepting or yielding mode of control in their 
      lives, and (3) higher scores on a measure of spiritual experiences. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The techniques of mindfulness meditation, with their emphasis on developing 
      detached observation and awareness of the contents of consciousness, may 
      represent a powerful cognitive behavioral coping strategy for transforming the 
      ways in which we respond to life events. They may also have potential for relapse 
      prevention in affective disorders.

TI  - The DARE study of relapse prevention in depression: design for a phase 1/2 
      translational randomised controlled trial involving mindfulness-based cognitive 
      therapy and supported self monitoring.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-12-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a common condition that typically has a relapsing 
      course. Effective interventions targeting relapse have the potential to 
      dramatically reduce the point prevalence of the condition. Mindfulness-based 
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based intervention that has shown efficacy in 
      reducing depressive relapse. While trials of MBCT to date have met the core 
      requirements of phase 1 translational research, there is a need now to move to 
      phase 2 translational research - the application of MBCT within real-world 
      settings with a view to informing policy and clinical practice. The aim of this 
      trial is to examine the clinical impact and health economics of MBCT under 
      real-world conditions and where efforts have been made to assess for and prevent 
      resentful demoralization among the control group. Secondary aims of the project 
      involve extending the phase 1 agenda to an examination of the effects of 
      co-morbidity and mechanisms of action. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is designed as 
      a prospective, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a 
      group comparison design between involving the intervention, MBCT, and a 
      self-monitoring comparison condition, Depression Relapse Active Monitoring 
      (DRAM). Follow-up is over 2 years. The design of the study indicates recruitment 
      from primary and secondary care of 204 participants who have a history of 3 or 
      more episodes of Major Depression but who are currently well. Measures assessing 
      depressive relapse/recurrence, time to first clinical intervention, treatment 
      expectancy and a range of secondary outcomes and process variables are included. 
      A health economics evaluation will be undertaken to assess the incremental cost 
      of MBCT. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial, including an examination of 
      clinical, functional and health economic outcomes, will be used to assess the 
      role that this treatment approach may have in recommendations for treatment of 
      depression in Australia and elsewhere. If the findings are positive, we expect 
      that this research will consolidate the evidence base to guide the decision to 
      fund MBCT and to seek to promote its availability to those who have experienced 
      at least 3 episodes of depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand

TI  - A randomized, controlled clinical trial: the effect of mindfulness-based 
      cognitive therapy on generalized anxiety disorder among Chinese community 
      patients: protocol for a randomized trial.
PG  - 187
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-11-187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests that an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
      Therapy (MBCT) program may be effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety 
      disorders. Our objective is to compare the clinical effectiveness of the MBCT 
      program with a psycho-education programme and usual care in reducing anxiety 
      symptoms in people suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS: A three 
      armed randomized, controlled clinical trial including 9-month post-treatment 
      follow-up is proposed. Participants screened positive using the Structure 
      Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for general anxiety disorder will be 
      recruited from community-based clinics. 228 participants will be randomly 
      allocated to the MBCT program plus usual care, psycho-education program plus 
      usual care or the usual care group. Validated Chinese version of instruments 
      measuring anxiety and worry symptoms, depression, quality of life and health 
      service utilization will be used. Our primary end point is the change of anxiety 
      and worry score (Beck Anxiety Inventory and Penn State Worry Scale) from baseline 
      to the end of intervention. For primary analyses, treatment outcomes will be 
      assessed by ANCOVA, with change in anxiety score as the baseline variable, while 
      the baseline anxiety score and other baseline characteristics that significantly 
      differ between groups will serve as covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This is a first 
      randomized controlled trial that compare the effectiveness of MBCT with an active 
      control, findings will advance current knowledge in the management of GAD and the 
      way that group intervention can be delivered and inform future research. Unique

TI  - CALM Pregnancy: results of a pilot study of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy 
      for perinatal anxiety.
PG  - 373-87
LID - 10.1007/s00737-013-0402-7 [doi]
AB  - Many women experience anxiety during pregnancy with potential negative effects on 
      maternal, birth, and child outcomes. Because of potential risks of fetal exposure 
      to psychotropic medications, efficacious non-pharmacologic approaches are 
      urgently needed. However, no published studies of psychotherapeutic treatments 
      for anxiety in pregnancy exist. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may 
      substantially reduce anxiety and co-morbid symptoms in people with anxiety 
      disorders. Coping with Anxiety through Living Mindfully (CALM) Pregnancy is an 
      adaptation of MBCT designed to address anxiety in pregnant women. This study 
      examined the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of the CALM 
      Pregnancy intervention in pregnant women anxiety. Twenty-four pregnant women with 
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or prominent symptoms of generalized anxiety 
      participated in an open treatment trial of the CALM Pregnancy group intervention. 
      Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by structured clinical interview, and 
      self-report measures of anxiety, worry, depression, self-compassion, and 
      mindfulness were completed at baseline and post-intervention. Qualitative 
      feedback was elicited via questionnaire. Twenty-three participants completed the 
      intervention with high attendance and good compliance with home practice. 
      Completers showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in 
      anxiety, worry, and depression, and significant increases in self-compassion and 
      mindfulness. Of the 17 participants who met GAD criteria at baseline, only one 
      continued to meet criteria post-intervention. Participants regarded their 
      experience in the intervention to be overwhelmingly positive. MBCT in the form of 
      the CALM Pregnancy intervention holds potential to provide effective, 
      non-pharmacological treatment for pregnant women with anxiety. These promising 
      findings warrant further testing of the intervention with a randomized controlled 
      trial.

TI  - Impact of breathing awareness meditation on ambulatory blood pressure and sodium 
      handling in prehypertensive African American adolescents.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the impact of a breathing awareness meditation 
      (BAM) program on ambulatory blood pressure and sodium handling in African 
      American adolescents with high-normal systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels. 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Following three consecutive days of SBP screenings, 66 
      eligible ninth graders were randomly assigned by school to either BAM (n = 20) or 
      health education control (n = 46) groups. The BAM group engaged in 10-minute BAM 
      sessions at school and at home each day for three months. Teachers conducted 
      sessions at school during health classes. Before and after the intervention, 
      overnight urine samples were collected, and ambulatory SBP, diastolic blood 
      pressure, and heart rate were recorded periodically for 24 hours. RESULTS: 
      Significant changes before and after the intervention were observed between BAM 
      and control groups for SBP during school hours (-4.7 vs .9 mm Hg, P < .05), SBP 
      at night (-4.8 vs -.6 mm Hg, P < .01), and heart rate during school hours (-6.7 
      vs -2.3 bpm, P < .02), adjusted for their respective preintervention levels. The 
      overnight urinary sodium excretion rate decreased in the BAM group but increased 
      in the control group (-.3 +/- 4.9 vs 1.1 +/- 4.0 mEq/hour, P < .03). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of BAM taught by 
      school health teachers on blood pressure control in the natural environment in 
      African American youth at risk for development of hypertension.

TI  - A pilot randomized control trial investigating the effect of mindfulness practice 
      on pain tolerance, psychological well-being, and physiological activity.
PG  - 297-300
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of mindfulness training on pain tolerance, 
      psychological well-being, physiological activity, and the acquisition of 
      mindfulness skills. METHODS: Forty-two asymptomatic University students 
      participated in a randomized, single-blind, active control pilot study. 
      Participants in the experimental condition were offered six (1-h) mindfulness 
      sessions; control participants were offered two (1-h) Guided Visual Imagery 
      sessions. Both groups were provided with practice CDs and encouraged to practice 
      daily. Pre-post pain tolerance (cold pressor test), mood, blood pressure, pulse, 
      and mindfulness skills were obtained. RESULTS: Pain tolerance significantly 
      increased in the mindfulness condition only. There was a strong trend indicating 
      that mindfulness skills increased in the mindfulness condition, but this was not 
      related to improved pain tolerance. Diastolic blood pressure significantly 
      decreased in both conditions. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness training did increase pain 
      tolerance, but this was not related to the acquisition of mindfulness skills.

      Mobile Health Application in African Americans.

AB  - Mindfulness is a promising health promotion strategy for African Americans, and 
      it is imperative that culturally responsive mindfulness approaches be accessible 
      to this population. One way to address this need is to develop and test if 
      culturally responsive mobile health (mhealth) applications are efficacious in 
      reducing stress-related outcomes in this population. With this goal in mind, we 
      employed a repeated-measures randomized control trial (RCT) across a 12-week 
      intervention period to evaluate if participants in the intervention group 
      outperformed a wait-list control group in reductions in stress, depressive 
      symptoms, anxiety, emotional regulation difficulties as well as in increases in 
      self-compassion, resilience, and mindfulness attitudes and behaviors. Our sample 
      included 170 Black/African American participants who were randomly assigned to 
      either the intervention condition (n = 84) or the wait-list control group 
      (n = 86). Participants in the intervention condition reported more 
      self-compassion, used more mindfulness, and had greater self-efficacy using 
      mindfulness; yet, no other differences were evident. Participants expressed high 
      levels of satisfaction with the app and gave it a positive rating for its 
      relevance to their lives. These findings support the efficacy of a culturally 
      responsive mindfulness mHealth app to enhance self-compassion and increase the 
      use of health-promoting behaviors, like mindfulness, among African Americans. 
      Implications for future research are discussed.

TI  - Innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress do 
      not predict subsequent compassion meditation practice time.
PG  - 310-5
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.06.008 [doi]
AB  - Increasing data suggest that meditation impacts stress-related physiological 
      processes relevant to health and disease. For example, our group recently 
      reported that the practice of compassion meditation was associated with reduced 
      innate immune (plasma interleukin [IL]-6) and subjective distress responses to a 
      standardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]). 
      However, because we administered a TSST after, but not prior to, meditation 
      training in our initial study, it remained possible that associations between 
      practice time and TSST outcomes reflected the fact that participants with reduced 
      stress responses prior to training were more able to practice compassion 
      meditation, rather than that meditation practice reduced stress responses. To 
      help resolve this ambiguity, we conducted the current study to evaluate whether 
      innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to a TSST conducted prior 
      to compassion meditation training in an independent sample of 32 medically health 
      young adults would predict subsequent amount of meditation practice time during a 
      compassion meditation training protocol identical to the one used in our first 
      study. No associations were found between responses to a TSST administered prior 
      to compassion meditation training and subsequent amount of meditation practice, 
      whether practice time was considered as a continuous variable or whether 
      meditators were divided into high and low practice time groups based on a median 
      split of mean number of practice sessions per week. These findings contrast 
      strikingly with our original study, in which high and low practice time 
      meditators demonstrated marked differences in IL-6 and distress responses to a 
      TSST administered after meditation training. In addition to providing the first 
      published data regarding stress responsivity as a potential predictor of 
      subsequent ability/willingness to practice meditation, the current study 
      strengthens findings from our initial work by supporting the conclusion that in 
      individuals who actively engage in practicing the technique, compassion 
      meditation may represent a viable strategy for reducing potentially deleterious 
      physiological and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of a brief mindfulness-based preventive 
      intervention on (a) dispositional (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003) and state (SMS; 
      Tanay & Bernstein, 2010) mindfulness; (b) putative proximal factors/processes 
      engendered through the development of mindfulness, including increased 
      decentering (EQ-D; Fresco et al., 2007) and reduced experiential avoidance (AAQ; 
      Hayes et al., 2004); and (c) distal mood and anxiety vulnerability factors, 
      including reduced depression-related dysfunctional attitudes, (DAS; de Graaf, 
      Roelofs, & Huibers, 2009), anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007), and 
      negative affectivity (PANAS-NA; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) among a 
      university-community sample in Israel. Fifty-three adult participants between the 
      ages of 20 and 52 (M(age)=25.2 years, SD(age)=4.3 years; 65.4% women) were 
      recruited from the Haifa University community. Nineteen participants were 
      randomly assigned to an experimental condition (M(age)=25.3 years, SD(age)=4.3 
      years; 66% women) and studied prospectively over the course of a four-session 
      (21-day) mindfulness skills training intervention; and 34 participants were 
      randomly assigned to a no-intervention (control) condition (M(age)=24.9 years, 
      SD(age)=2.4years; 64.7% women) and studied prospectively. Findings demonstrate 
      statistically robust and clinically significant relations between mindfulness and 
      the theorized proximal and distal mood and anxiety vulnerability factors. 
      Findings are discussed with respect to their theoretical implications for better 
      understanding mindfulness-psychopathology vulnerability relations, clinical 
      implications for larger-scale universal and selective transdiagnostic prevention 
      efforts, and future directions for this area of research.

AB  - Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of 
      negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of 
      recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life 
      (QOL) and well-being. As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation, 
      calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes 
      in health outcomes in cancer survivors. In this exploratory study, which 
      comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the 
      feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors 
      and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind-body interventions, mind-body 
      bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene 
      education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with 
      self-reported sleep disturbance. Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once 
      per week for 3 weeks. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention 
      (~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up. In this cancer 
      survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable 
      across the 3 time points, of about 3 months' duration, and mean baseline sOT 
      levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age. 
      Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however, 
      several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT 
      levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and 
      positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being. Regarding 
      intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly 
      larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE. In 
      this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater 
      reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE, 
      and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group 
      compared with those in SHE. The findings in this exploratory study suggest that 
      sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into 
      the effects of mind-body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.

TI  - Compassionate Attention and Regulation of Eating Behaviour: A pilot study of a 
      brief low-intensity intervention for binge eating.
PG  - O1437-O1447
LID - 10.1002/cpp.2094 [doi]
AB  - A low-intensity 4-week intervention that included components of compassion, 
      mindfulness, and acceptance was delivered to women diagnosed with binge eating 
      disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: intervention 
      (n = 11) or waiting list control (n = 9). Participants in the intervention 
      condition were invited to practise mindfulness, soothing rhythm breathing, and 
      compassionate imagery practices with a focus on awareness and acceptance of 
      emotional states and triggers to binge eating and engagement in helpful actions. 
      Results revealed that, in the intervention group, there were significant 
      reductions in eating psychopathology symptoms, binge eating symptoms, 
      self-criticism, and indicators of psychological distress; there were significant 
      increases in compassionate actions and body image-related psychological 
      flexibility. Data suggest that developing compassion and acceptance competencies 
      may improve eating behaviour and psychological well-being in individuals with 
      binge eating disorder.

TI  - MBSR vs aerobic exercise in social anxiety: fMRI of emotion regulation of 
      negative self-beliefs.
PG  - 65-72
LID - 10.1093/scan/nss054 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is thought to reduce emotional 
      reactivity and enhance emotion regulation in patients with social anxiety 
      disorder (SAD). The goal of this study was to examine the neural correlates of 
      deploying attention to regulate responses to negative self-beliefs using 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were 56 patients with 
      generalized SAD in a randomized controlled trial who were assigned to MBSR or a 
      comparison aerobic exercise (AE) stress reduction program. Compared to AE, MBSR 
      yielded greater (i) reductions in negative emotion when implementing regulation 
      and (ii) increases in attention-related parietal cortical regions. Meditation 
      practice was associated with decreases in negative emotion and social anxiety 
      symptom severity, and increases in attention-related parietal cortex neural 
      responses when implementing attention regulation of negative self-beliefs. 
      Changes in attention regulation during MBSR may be an important psychological 
      factor that helps to explain how mindfulness meditation training benefits 
      patients with anxiety disorders.

TI  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus psycho-education for patients with 
      major depression who did not achieve remission following antidepressant 
      treatment: a preliminary analysis.
PG  - 756-60
LID - 10.1089/acm.2011.0407 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare mindfulness-based 
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) with a psycho-educational control group designed to be 
      structurally equivalent to the MBCT program but excluding the claimed "active 
      ingredient" of MBCT (i.e., mindfulness meditation practice) for the treatment of 
      patients with major depression (MD). DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled 
      trial. LOCATION: The study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, 
      University of Bologna, Italy. SUBJECTS: Patients who had MD and who did not 
      achieve remission following at least 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment were 
      considered for inclusion. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive MBCT or 
      psycho-education and were prospectively followed for 8 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      MD severity was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). 
      Measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life, as measured with the Beck 
      Anxiety Inventory, Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale, and the 
      Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI), respectively, were also included. 
      All assessments were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Changes of 
      psychologic variables over the study period were analyzed by means of the 
      repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Of 29 screened subjects, 16 
      received MBCT or psycho-education. Both HAMD and PGWBI scores improved to a 
      significantly higher extent in the MBCT group than in the psycho-educational 
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by a small sample size and the lack 
      of follow-up measures, the results of this preliminary study suggest the 
      superiority of MBCT over psycho-education for subjects who had MD and who did not 
      achieve remission following antidepressant treatment.

TI  - Increases in positive reappraisal coping during a group-based mantram 
      intervention mediate sustained reductions in anger in HIV-positive persons.
PG  - 74-80
LID - 10.1007/s12529-008-9007-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that various meditation practices reduce distress, 
      but little is known about the mechanisms of frequently repeating a mantram-a 
      spiritual word or phrase-on distress reduction. Mantram repetition is the 
      portable practice of focusing attention frequently on a mantram throughout the 
      day without a specific time, place, or posture. PURPOSE: We examined the 
      hypothesis of whether increases in positive reappraisal coping or distancing 
      coping mediated the sustained decreases in anger found following a group-based 
      mantram intervention that was designed to train attention and promote awareness 
      of internal experiences. METHOD: A secondary analysis was performed on data 
      collected from a randomized controlled trial that compared a group-based mantram 
      intervention (n = 46) to an attention-matched control (n = 47) in a community 
      sample of human immunodeficiency virus-positive adults. Positive reappraisal and 
      distancing coping were explored as potential mediators of anger reduction. 
      RESULTS: Participants in the mantram intervention reported significant increases 
      in positive reappraisal coping over the 5-week intervention period, whereas the 
      control group reported decreases. Increases in positive reappraisal coping during 
      the 5-week intervention period appear to mediate the effect of mantram on 
      decreased anger at 22-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a 
      group-based mantram intervention may reduce anger by enhancing positive 
      reappraisal coping.

TI  - Efficacy of Exercise Therapy in Persons with Burnout. A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 475-484
AB  - An increasing amount of scientific work suggests positive effects of 
      exercise-related interventions in patients with burnout. Exercise therapy could 
      therefore be a useful intervention procedure in the treatment of burnout. The aim 
      of this meta-analysis is to examine empirical findings for exercise therapy used 
      to treat burnout in the occupational setting, including the variety of the 
      application and variety of the exercise modality itself. Electronic databases 
      (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubPsych, PsycInfo) were searched (January 
      2018) for randomized controlled trials reporting on exercise therapy intervention 
      studies in persons with burnout. The burnout scores from the various measurement 
      instruments as well as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI) were calculated and seen as the main outcomes and measures. Four 
      out of six studies with a total sample of 248 participants could be used for 
      meta-analysis. A statement on the combined effect size can only be made with 
      caution due to the length of the confidence interval of [-0.41; 0.09]. With an I² 
      value of 0%, no heterogeneity is present in this meta-analysis. Ultimately there 
      was no clear difference found between intervention and control conditions. This 
      paper does not support the widespread assumption that exercise therapy seems to 
      be a successful means to alleviate burnout symptoms. However, the different types 
      of physical activity and treatment modalities used in the included studies impede 
      clear conclusions. Future studies should deal with the specific efficacy of 
      different exercise modalities and their combination with further cognitive 
      behavioural or mindfulness-based interventions.

TI  - A pilot study to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based stress-reduction and 
      relaxation program on levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, and 
      submaximal exercise responses.
PG  - 819-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Stress has been cited as a causal factor in heart disease. The 
      objective of this study was to examine the effects of an 8-week mindfulness-based 
      stress-reduction program on the resting levels of stress hormones, physical 
      functioning, and submaximal exercise responses in women with heart disease. 
      SUBJECTS: Random selection with the numbers 1 and 2 were used to assign 18 women 
      (60 +/-6.3 years old) with documented histories of heart disease to a treatment 
      group (n = 9) or a control group (n = 9). Speilberger's state anxiety scores for 
      the treatment (M = 37.88; standard deviation (SD) = 10.91) and control group (M = 
      43.22; SD = 12.26) were not significantly different prior to the start of the 
      study. However, their scores fell in the upper percentile rank for normal adults 
      in their age category. INTERVENTION: The intervention was provided one night each 
      week for 2 hours over a period of 8 weeks. The intervention included didactic, 
      inductive, and experiential modes of learning regarding stress responses and 
      mindfulness skill-development training. DESIGN: Pre-post test hormonal 
      measurements and physical function were analyzed using a 2 (group) by 2 (time) 
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures following the 8-week program. 
      Submaximal exercise responses were also compared between the treatment group and 
      the control group following the 8-week program. A 2 (group) by 3 (time) ANOVA 
      with repeated measures was used to analyze the data. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Weekly 
      meetings were held on a university medical school campus. Submaximal exercise 
      responses were recorded while participants cycled on a stationary bike in an 
      applied physiology laboratory following the 8-week program. RESULTS: There were 
      no significant main effects or interaction for the resting levels of stress 
      hormones or physical functioning. There were no significant interactions for the 
      submaximal exercise responses, however, there were significant main effects 
      between groups for ventilation [F(2,32) = 7.65, p < .01, f = 0.8], and between 
      group [F(1,16) = 8.84, p < .01, f = 0.8] and time [F(2,32) = 10.42, p < .01, f = 
      0.9], for breathing frequency. CONCLUSION: While the 8-week stress reduction 
      program for women with heart disease did not show significant interactions 
      between groups for resting levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, or 
      submaximal exercise responses, there was a significant difference in breathing 
      patterns between the 2 groups during exercise following the mindfulness-based 
      stress-reduction program. There was also a trend for change in the intervention 
      group in the resting levels of cortisol and physical function scores that was not 
      seen in the control group. Future studies could use the effect size generated 
      from this pilot study to calculate the number of subjects needed for adequate 
      power to detect significant differences between groups.

TI  - Developing an observing attitude: an analysis of meditation diaries in an MBSR 
      clinical trial.
PG  - 80-93
LID - 10.1002/cpp.700 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week training that is designed 
      to teach participants mindful awareness of the present moment. In randomized 
      clinical trials (RCTs), MBSR has demonstrated efficacy in various conditions 
      including reducing chronic pain-related distress and improving quality of life in 
      healthy individuals. There have, however, been no qualitative studies 
      investigating participants' descriptions of changes experienced over multiple 
      time points during the course of the programme. This qualitative study of an MBSR 
      cohort (N = 8 healthy individuals) in a larger RCT examined participants' daily 
      diary descriptions of their home-practice experiences. The study used a two-part 
      method, combining grounded theory with a close-ended coding approach. The 
      grounded theory analysis revealed that during the trial, all participants, to 
      varying degrees, described moments of distress related to practice; at the end of 
      the course, all participants who completed the training demonstrated greater 
      detail and clarity in their descriptions, improved affect, and the emergence of 
      an observing self. The closed-ended coding schema, carried out to shed light on 
      the development of an observing self, revealed that the emergence of an observing 
      self was not related to the valence of participants' experiential descriptions: 
      even participants whose diaries contained predominantly negative 
      characterizations of their experience throughout the trial were able, by the end 
      of the trial, to demonstrate an observing, witnessing attitude towards their own 
      distress. Progress in MBSR may rely less on the valence of participants' 
      experiences and more on the way participants describe and relate to their own 
      inner experience.

TI  - The experiences of parents in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.
PG  - 103-19
LID - 10.1177/1359104510392296 [doi]
AB  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a relatively new intervention that 
      has been developed to help people with recurrent depression stay well in the long 
      term. Although there is evidence that depression impacts negatively on parenting, 
      little is known regarding MBCT's potential impact on parenting. This study used a 
      qualitative design to explore how parents with a history of recurrent depression 
      experience their relationships with their children one year after MBCT. We 
      interviewed 16 parents who had participated in MBCT as part of a randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) (Kuyken et al., 2008). Thematic analysis was used to 
      identify prevalent themes in parents' accounts, including: (i) emotional 
      reactivity and regulation; (ii) empathy and acceptance; (iii) involvement; (iv) 
      emotional availability and comfort; and (v) recognition of own needs. Based on 
      these exploratory findings, we suggest that some components of MBCT may help 
      parents with a history of depression with emotional availability, emotion 
      regulation and self-care and set out avenues of further research.

TI  - Therapygenetics in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: do genes have an impact 
      on therapy-induced change in real-life positive affective experiences?
PG  - e384
LID - 10.1038/tp.2014.23 [doi]
AB  - Positive affect (PA) has an important role in resilience against depression and 
      has been shown to increase with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). To 
      elucidate the underlying mechanisms of change in PA as well as develop insights 
      that may benefit personalized medicine, the current study examined the 
      contribution of genetic variation to individual differences in change in PA in 
      response to MBCT. Individuals (n=126) with residual depressive symptoms were 
      randomized to either an MBCT group or treatment as usual. PA was assessed using 
      experience sampling methodology (ESM). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
      genes known to be involved in reward functioning were selected. SNPs in the genes 
      for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the muscarinic acetylcholine 
      receptor M2 (CHRM2), the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and the μ1 opioid receptor 
      (OPRM1) significantly moderated the impact of treatment condition over time on 
      PA. Genetic variation in the genes for CHRM2 and OPRM1 specifically had an impact 
      on the level of PA following MBCT. The current study shows that variation in 
      response to MBCT may be contingent on genetic factors associated with the 
      regulation of PA. These findings contribute to our understanding of the processes 
      moderating response to treatment and prediction of treatment outcome.

TI  - A brief self-administered psychological intervention to improve well-being in 
      patients with cancer: results from a feasibility study.
PG  - 1323-6
LID - 10.1002/pon.1516 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer have relatively high rates of anxiety and 
      distress, adversely affecting their well-being and quality of life. Recent 
      studies indicate that addressing these symptoms could result in better response 
      to cancer treatment. Researchers have found that interventions that focus on 
      increasing mental awareness and the frequency of positive experiences may have a 
      greater impact on reducing psychological morbidity and increasing quality of life 
      than interventions that target relief of psychological symptoms. AIM: To develop 
      and test a brief, easy to use intervention that could improve well-being and 
      quality of life in cancer patients. METHODS: We developed a simple well-being 
      intervention that made few demands on patient time and required little training 
      resource. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a 
      deferred entry group. Measures of anxiety, depression, well-being and quality of 
      life were administered at baseline and at follow-ups. RESULTS: Twenty-two women 
      with metastatic breast cancer and 24 men with metastatic prostate cancer were 
      recruited from oncology clinics. Thirteen women and 14 men completed the study. 
      Both qualitative and quantitative data showed that the intervention was 
      acceptable to users. There was statistically significant improvement in quality 
      of life scores on WHOQOL-BREF post-intervention (p=0.046). Compliance with the 
      intervention was good. CONCLUSIONS: This brief well-being intervention appears to 
      be a promising technique for improving quality of life of cancer patients, 
      without making undue demands on staff resources or patient time. If further 
      studies confirm its effectiveness, it could prove to be a cost-effective 
      intervention.

AB  - Mental training by meditation has been related to changes in high-level cognitive 
      functions that involve top-down processing. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate whether the practice of meditation is also related to alterations in 
      low-level, bottom-up processing. Therefore, intersensory facilitation (IF) 
      effects in a group of mindfulness meditators (MM) were compared to IF effects in 
      an age- and gender-matched control group. Smaller and even absent IF effects were 
      found in the MM group, which suggests that changes in bottom-up processing are 
      associated with MM. Furthermore, reduced interference of a visual warning 
      stimulus with the IF effects was found, which suggests an improved allocation of 
      attentional resources in mindfulness meditators, even across modalities.

TI  - Effects of meditation on frontal alpha-asymmetry in previously suicidal 
      individuals.
PG  - 709-12
AB  - This study investigated the effects of a meditation-based treatment for 
      preventing relapse to depression, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), on 
      prefrontal alpha-asymmetry in resting electroencephalogram (EEG), a biological 
      indicator of affective style. Twenty-two individuals with a previous history of 
      suicidal depression were randomly assigned to either MBCT (N=10) or 
      treatment-as-usual (TAU, N=12). Resting electroencephalogram was measured before 
      and after an 8-week course of treatment. The TAU group showed a significant 
      deterioration toward decreased relative left-frontal activation, indexing 
      decreases in positive affective style, while there was no significant change in 
      the MBCT group. The findings suggest that MBCT can help individuals at high risk 
      for suicidal depression to retain a balanced pattern of baseline emotion-related 
      brain activation.
