        "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an enduring pattern of instability across affective, behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal domains. Individuals with BPD are known to be particularly vulnerable to experiences of social rejection, but little work has examined strategies that may moderate their reactivity to social rejection. Using a laboratory experimental approach, this study investigated the effects of brief mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) inductions on emotional and behavioral responses to social rejection in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. One hundred and eighteen participants were randomly assigned to receive 10 min of mindful breathing practice, LKM, or a no-instruction control condition, prior to exposure to a social rejection manipulation. Participants rated their emotions and completed a competitive reaction time task, which provided a proxy measure of aggression. Compared to the control condition, the mindfulness group demonstrated significantly quicker recovery in negative affect and feelings of rejection after social rejection. The mindfulness group also reported significantly quicker recovery in negative affect compared to the LKM group. Whereas baseline trait mindfulness negatively predicted aggressive behaviors across all participants, groups did not differ in immediate emotional reactivity or aggressive behavior following social rejection. The findings suggest that mindfulness training may be a promising strategy in alleviating negative emotional effects of social rejection among individuals with high borderline personality traits, and highlight the limited utility of brief LKM practice in buffering the effects of social rejection.

        "abstract": "Self-compassion is conceptualized as containing 3 core components: self-kindness versus self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus overidentification, when relating to painful experiences. Research evidence demonstrates that self-compassion is related to psychological flourishing and reduced psychopathology. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) is an 8-week training program, meeting 2.5 hours each week, designed to help participants cultivate self-compassion. MSC contains a variety of meditations (e.g., loving-kindness, affectionate breathing) as well as informal practices for use in daily life (e.g., soothing touch, self-compassionate letter writing). A detailed clinical case illustrates the journey of a client through the 8 weeks of MSC training, describing the key features of each session and the client's response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Paranoia may build on negative beliefs held both about the self and others. Compassionate imagery may be one way of reducing such negative beliefs, and hence paranoia. Two studies tested this idea, one targeting compassion for the self and one targeting compassion for others. Two-hundred individuals from the general population scoring highly for paranoia were recruited. The studies used a randomised controlled experimental design, with embedded tests for mediation. Study one targeted self-compassion via creation of a compassionate coach (CC) image. Study two targeted compassion for others via loving kindness meditation (LKM). Individuals repeatedly entered neutral virtual reality social environments. Changes in compassion and paranoia were assessed. Compared to controls, the CC group increased in self-compassion (group difference = 2.12, C.I. = 1.57;2.67, p = <0.0001, d = 1.4) and decreased in paranoia (group difference = -1.73, C.I. = -2.48; -0.98, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in self-compassion explained 57% of change in paranoia. Compared to controls, the LKM group increased their compassion for others (group difference = 3.26, C.I. = 2.72;3.80, p = <0.0001, d = 1.7), and decreased in paranoia (group difference = -1.70, C.I. = -2.50; -0.89, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in compassion for others explained 67% of change in paranoia. Targeting negative beliefs about the self and others using compassionate imagery causes reductions in paranoia.

        "abstract": "<bold>Background: </bold>Depression is a widespread disorder with severe impacts for individuals and society, especially in its chronic form. Current treatment approaches for persistent depression have focused primarily on reducing negative affect and have paid little attention to promoting positive affect. Previous studies have shown that metta meditation increases positive affect in chronically depressed patients. Results from previous trials provide evidence for the efficacy of a stand-alone metta meditation group treatment in combination with mindfulness-based approaches. Further research is needed to better understand the implementation of meditation practice into everyday life. Therefore, mindfulness and metta meditation in a group setting are combined with individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into a new, low-intensity, cost-effective treatment (\"MeCBT\") for chronic depression.<bold>Methods/design: </bold>In this single-center, randomized, observer-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial we will test the efficacy of MeCBT in reducing depression compared to a wait-list control condition. Forty-eight participants in a balanced design will be allocated randomly to a treatment group or a wait-list control group. Metta-based group meditation will be offered in eight weekly sessions and one additional half-day retreat. Subsequent individual CBT will be conducted in eight fortnightly sessions. Outcome measures will be assessed at four time points: before intervention (T0); after group meditation (T1); after individual CBT (T2); and, in the treated group only, at 6-month follow-up (T3). Changes in depressive symptoms (clinician rating), assessed with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-C) are the primary outcome. We expect a significant decline of depressive symptoms at T2 compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary outcome measures include self-rated depression, mindfulness, benevolence, rumination, emotion regulation, social connectedness, social functioning, as well as behavioral and cognitive avoidance. We will explore changes at T1 and T2 in all these secondary outcome variables.<bold>Discussion: </bold>To our knowledge this is the first study to combine a group program focusing on Metta meditation with state-of-the art individual CBT specifically tailored to chronic depression.

        "abstract": "We explore the role of meditative practice in cultivating experiences of compassion, empathy, and altruism and address an apparent paradox: Meditation often is associated with solitary retreat, if not preoccupation with one's own concerns. How, then, does such a practice promote compassion for others? We propose a two-stage model. The first stage involves disengagement from usual preoccupation with self-reinforcing, self-defeating, or self-indulgent behaviors and reactions; the second involves a focused engagement with a universal human capacity for altruistic experience, love, and compassion. Reference is made to the limited research literature and to clinical applications of loving kindness (metta) meditation in cultivating these processes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "The Attention Training Technique (ATT) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) are two promising psychological interventions. ATT is a 12-min auditory exercise designed to strengthen attentional control and promote external focus of attention, while MSC uses guided meditation and exercises designed to promote self-compassion. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), a three-session intervention trial was conducted in which university students were randomly assigned to either an ATT-group (n = 40) or a MSC-group (n = 41). The students were not assessed with diagnostic interviews but had self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress. Participants listened to audiotapes of ATT or MSC before discussing in groups how to apply these principles for their everyday struggles. Participants also listened to audiotapes of ATT and MSC as homework between sessions. Participants in both groups showed significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression accompanied by significant increases in mindfulness, self-compassion, and attention flexibility post-intervention. These results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Improvement in attention flexibility was the only significant unique predictor of treatment response. The study supports the use of both ATT and MSC for students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, it suggests that symptom improvement is related to changes in attention flexibility across both theoretical frameworks. Future studies should focus on how to strengthen the ability for attention flexibility to optimize treatment for emotional disorder. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "title": "Mindful self-compassion program for chronic pain patients: A randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Background: Although evidence-based psychological treatments for chronic pain (CP) have been demonstrated to be effective for a variety of outcomes, modest effects observed in recent reviews indicate scope for improvement. Self-compassion promotes a proactive attitude towards self-care and actively seeking relief from suffering. Consequently, more compassionate people experience better physical, psychological and interpersonal well-being. Methods: We conducted a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial to examine the effects of a Mindful Self-Compassion program (MSC) on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with CP. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention arms: MSC or cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). The protocols of both intervention arms were standardized and consisted of a 150-min session once a week during 8 weeks formatted to groups of no more than 20 participants. The primary outcome was self-compassion, measured with the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). The secondary outcomes were other pain-related scores, quality-of-life measures, and anxiety and depression scores. Results: In all, 62 and 61 patients were assigned to the MSC and CBT groups, respectively. The MSC intervention was more effective than CBT for self-compassion (average treatment effect [ATE] = 0.126, p < 0.05). The secondary outcomes, pain acceptance (ATE = 5.214, p < 0.01), pain interference (ATE = -0.393, p < 0.05), catastrophizing (ATE = -2.139, p < 0.10) and anxiety (ATE = -0.902, p < 0.05), were also favoured in the experimental arm (MSC). No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions: Mindful Self-Compassion is an appropriate therapeutic approach for CP patients and may result in greater benefits on self-compassion and emotional well-being than CBT. Significance: This randomized controlled trial compares the novel intervention (MSC program) with the gold standard psychological intervention for CP (CBT). MSC improves the levels of self-compassion, a therapeutic target that is receiving attention since the last two decades, and it also improves anxiety symptoms, pain interference and pain acceptance more than what CBT does. These results provide empirical support to guide clinical work towards the promotion of self-compassion in psychotherapeutic interventions for people with CP.

        "title": "The two arrows of pain: Mechanisms of pain related to meditation and mental states of aversion and identification",
        "abstract": "Objectives: According to the core Buddhist psychology models of the 'two arrows of pain' and 'co-dependent origination,' pain is the resultant of bodily and mental factors, which can be regulated by meditation states and traits. Here we investigated how pain and the related aversion and identification (self-involvement) experiences are modulated by focused attention meditation (FAM), open monitoring meditation (OMM), and loving kindness meditation (LKM), as well as by meditation expertise. Methods: Theravada Buddhist long-term meditators were matched with a group of short-term meditators. Nociceptive electrical stimulation was administered during FAM, OMM, and LKM, and in a non-meditative rest condition. Experience reports of pain, aversion, and identification were collected in each trial. Results: Pain thresholds were higher in long-term meditators than in short-term meditators. In the short-term meditators, as compared to rest, pain was reduced in FAM and OMM, and aversion and identification in all meditation conditions. In the long-term meditators, pain was reduced only in LKM. Identification was reduced in the three forms of meditation, while aversion was not affected by meditation. Further analyses with a particular focus on long-term meditators showed that pain was predicted to increase with meditation expertise, aversion, and identification. Granger causality analysis revealed that aversion and pain, as well as aversion and identification, causally influenced each other; identification causally influenced pain. This pattern of results about the relationships between pain, aversion, and identification was largely overlapping in the group of short-term meditators. Conclusions: The findings reveal mechanisms of pain in interaction with aversive and identification mental states, as well as their modulation by meditation states and traits. They also suggest that pain feeling is the resultant of coupling of sensory and mental factors, thus highlighting the relevance of the second arrow of pain and providing a clarification of the epistemological gap between sensory causation and mental state causation of pain, in terms of a co-production mechanism with multiple stages. In particular, the evidence about the causal influences of identification on pain highlights a self-related factor of relevance in pain experiences that can be modulated by mindfulness. The study also inspires new testable neuroscientific hypotheses, and sheds new light on core Buddhist psychology models, based on evidence from a controlled experimental setting and experience dimension reports by long-term meditators with enhanced mindfulness skills.

        "abstract": "Background Evidence suggests that facilitating empathy could improve individuals' well-being. Loving-kindness meditation ( LKM) could be a facilitator, and online delivery a cost-effective format. Methods We conducted an internet-based randomised controlled trial recruiting 809 adults to test whether an LKM course improves well-being through evoking pleasant emotions, psychological resources, and altruism compared to a light physical exercise course ( LE). Participants in both arms followed video-based instructions, completed post-intervention questionnaires, and used online diaries and forums. To measure altruism \u00a310/$10 were offered to participants with a choice of donating all/half to charity. Thematic analysis was applied to diary/forum entries. Results Both courses increased well-being without significant differences. LKM participants were less anxious than LE participants (\u00df = -0.22, 95% confidence interval ( CI) [-0.43, -0.02], p = .03), and more likely to donate \u00a35/$5 (Relative Risk = 3.57, 95% CI [0.82, 15.50], p = .09). Attrition was high (82%). Participants engaged in diary/forum usage. LKM was an emotionally intense experience, generating deep reflections and increased connectedness but difficult for some to process. LE led to gentle increases in relaxation, generating a sense of achievement. Conclusions Future research needs to confirm findings and devise ways of delivering online LKM effectively to diverse populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental condition characterized by a range of cognitive and behavioral vulnerabilities, including chronic shame and deficits in social problem solving (SPS) abilities. Little research however, has examined strategies that may alleviate shame and SPS deficits among individuals with BPD traits. Using a laboratory experimental approach, the present study compared the effects of a brief mindfulness versus loving-kindness meditation (LKM) induction on shame and SPS abilities in a sample of adults with high BPD traits. Eighty-eight participants underwent a shame induction procedure involving recall of a negative autobiographical memory. They were then randomly assigned to 10 min of mindful breathing or LKM, or a no-instruction condition. Shame and SPS abilities were assessed via visual analogue scales and the Means-Ends Problem Solving task respectively. Results indicated that there were significant decreases in shame from pre-to post-regulation in the mindfulness group versus the LKM and no-instruction groups. Groups did not differ on changes in SPS abilities from pre-to post-regulation. Overall, the findings support the efficacy of mindfulness as a strategy to regulate shame among individuals with BPD traits, and raises questions with regard to the utility of LKM in modulating shame in the context of high emotional arousal.

        "abstract": "Our goal was to assess the effects of long-term mental training in socio-affective skills on structural brain networks. We studied a group of long-term meditation practitioners (LTMs) who have focused on cultivating socio-affective skills using loving-kindness and compassion meditation for an average of 40k h, comparing these to meditation-naive controls. To maximize homogeneity of prior practice, LTMs were included only if they had undergone extensive full-time meditation retreats in the same center. MRI-based cortical thickness analysis revealed increased thickness in the LTM cohort relative to meditation-native controls in fronto-insular cortices. To identify functional networks relevant for the generation of socio-affective states, structural imaging analysis were complemented by fMRI analysis in LTMs, showing amplitude increases during a loving-kindness meditation session relative to non-meditative rest in multiple prefrontal and insular regions bilaterally. Importantly, functional findings partially overlapped with regions of cortical thickness increases in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, suggesting that these regions may play a central role in the generation of emotional states relevant for the meditative practice. Our multi-modal MRI approach revealed structural changes in LTMs who have cultivated loving-kindness and compassion for a significant period of their life in functional networks activated by these practices. These preliminary cross-sectional findings motivate future longitudinal work studying brain plasticity following the regular practice of skills aiming at enhancing human altruism and prosocial motivation.

        "abstract": "To better understand the cultivation of positive intra- and interpersonal emotions, we examined an argument that some effects of contemplative training result from language processing. We presented participants with loving-kindness language used in kindness-meditation training studies and asked them to rate imagined pain. If loving-kindness language processing is responsible for some effects recently reported we expected this language could affect intra- and interpersonal sensitivity. Loving-kindness-language participants rated imagined other-pain significantly higher and imagined self-pain significantly lower than closely matched control participants. As a result of this interaction, the loving-kindness-language group showed no significant difference between self-pain and other-pain, whereas controls rated self-pain significantly higher than other-pain. These results suggest that exposure to loving-kindness-language in Loving-Kindness Meditation leads to changes in sensitivity to own and vicarious distress without explicit training. These findings underscore that meditation-like effects may be easily induced. Further research is needed to determine duration and degree of effect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

To fill this gap, we explore the validity of Micro-phenomenological Interviews (MpI) to assess experiences during breathing meditation (BM), observing-thought meditation (OTM), and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). We performed psycholinguistic analyses, quantitative ratings and qualitative explorations of 104 MpI (N = 57). All results reveal differential affective, bodily and sensorial fingerprints: BM-transcripts contain the most body-related vocabulary, specifically sensations in nose and abdomen. OTM-transcripts contain the most cognition-related vocabulary. OTM is experienced in head and face. LKM-transcripts contain the most vocabulary related to socio-affective processes. LKM is associated to love, sensations around the heart, and warmth. The LKM-outcomes were replicated with another independent set of MpI.

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the effects of meditation practice on affective processing and resilience have the potential to induce neuroplastic changes within the amygdala. Notably, literature speculates that meditation training may reduce amygdala activity during negative affective processing. Nonetheless, studies have thus far not verified this speculation. In this longitudinal study, participants (<italic>N</italic> = 21, 9 men) were trained in awareness-based compassion meditation (ABCM) or matched relaxation training. The effects of meditation training on amygdala activity were examined during passive viewing of affective and neutral stimuli in a non-meditative state. We found that the ABCM group exhibited significantly reduced anxiety and right amygdala activity during negative emotion processing than the relaxation group. Furthermore, ABCM participants who performed more compassion practice had stronger right amygdala activity reduction during negative emotion processing. The lower right amygdala activity after ABCM training may be associated with a general reduction in reactivity and distress. As all participants performed the emotion processing task in a non-meditative state, it appears likely that the changes in right amygdala activity are carried over from the meditation practice into the non-meditative state. These findings suggest that the distress-reducing effects of meditation practice on affective processing may transfer to ordinary states, which have important implications on stress management.

MAT participants demonstrated significant and sustainable improvements (with strong effect sizes) over control-group participants in levels of work-related stress, job satisfaction, psychological distress, and employer-rated job performance.

        "abstract": "Due to its potential to improve work-related stress and job performance, there is growing interest into the applications of mindfulness in the workplace setting. To date, mindfulness research within occupational psychology has mostly involved First Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (FG-MBIs). However, a growing number of researchers, clinicians, and Buddhist teachers/scholars have suggested that FG-MBIs may only partially embody the full potency of mindfulness when compared with its utilisation in traditional Buddhist practice settings. Consequently, recent years have witnessed the early stage evaluation of a number of Second Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (SG-MBIs). Although still secular, SG-MBIs are overtly spiritual in aspect and teach mindfulness within a practice infrastructure that integrates what would traditionally be deemed as prerequisites for effective spiritual and meditative development. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first qualitative investigation to analyse the experiences of employed participants receiving training in a SG-MBI. Ten participants were randomly selected from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial assessing the effects of meditation awareness training (MAT) on work-related wellbeing and job performance. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse participant experiences of MAT, and six themes emerged from the data-set: (1) changing attitudes towards work, (2) improved job performance, (3) letting go of self, (4) phenomena feed-back effect, (5) wellbeing at work and (6) taking responsibility for one's spiritual growth. Findings have important implications for the development of authentic mindfulness training programs and suggest that, compared with FG-MBIs, the SG-MBI approach may be tapping into different metacognitive resources.

        "abstract": "Loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LKCM) are considered a promising practice for increasing long-term well-being. While previous studies have mainly focused on meditation practice quantity, the current study provides an initial exploration of the quality of meditation during multiweek LKCM training. Data were collected through offline (Study 1; N = 41) and online (Study 2; N = 243) LKCM interventions. Quality of meditation was measured using two kinds of difficulties experienced during LKCM each week/unit (i.e., difficulty in concentration and difficulty in generating prosocial attitudes). Subjective well-being (SWB) was assessed by life satisfaction before and after training as well as positive and negative emotions each week/unit. Two studies consistently suggested that meditation quality was significantly associated with changes in SWB. Study 1 even showed that quality had a stronger association with SWB than did meditation quantity. Moreover, both short-term (measured each week/unit) and long-term (measured across the entire training period) associations between the quality of meditation and SWB were significant. Focusing on meditation quality, our findings provide theoretical and methodological pathways for understanding the contribution of meditation practice to LKCM training, which is helpful for guiding future research and best practices.

        "title": "Does loving-kindness meditation elicit empathic emotions? The moderating role of self-discrepancy and self-esteem on guilt",
        "abstract": "Our understanding of the emotions elicited by loving-kindness meditation (LKM) at early stages of practice is limited, despite the influence that these emotions may have on later engagement. Past work suggests that LKM may elicit emotional ambivalence at early stages of the practice, but it is still unclear whether the content of LKM activates this ambivalence and who is more likely to experience it. Given the specific content of LKM, we defend that this meditation is likely to elicit empathetic emotions, both positive (compassion and gratitude) and negative (guilt), to a greater extent than an active control. Guilt is likely to be elicited by memories of incidents where naive meditators were not able to experience compassion and/or by the difficulties in sending compassionate love to disliked others during the meditation. Furthermore, individuals with greater self-discrepancy and lower self-esteem are more likely to experience guilt. These hypotheses were tested in two experimental studies with community and student samples (n = 55 and n = 33, respectively) and using a brief intervention. The results support the hypotheses. These findings have implications for instructors of LKM, especially when organizing meditation practices with naive meditators who should be aware of the potential negative emotions elicited by this meditation.

        "title": "BOLD signal and functional connectivity associated with loving kindness meditation.",
        "abstract": "Loving kindness is a form of meditation involving directed well-wishing, typically supported by the silent repetition of phrases such as 'may all beings be happy,' to foster a feeling of selfless love. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neural substrate of loving kindness meditation in experienced meditators and novices. We first assessed group differences in blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD) signal during loving kindness meditation. We next used a relatively novel approach, the intrinsic connectivity distribution of functional connectivity, to identify regions that differ in intrinsic connectivity between groups, and then used a data-driven approach to seed-based connectivity analysis to identify which connections differ between groups. Our findings suggest group differences in brain regions involved in self-related processing and mind wandering, emotional processing, inner speech, and memory. Meditators showed overall reduced BOLD signal and intrinsic connectivity during loving kindness as compared to novices, more specifically in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus ( PCC/ PCu), a finding that is consistent with our prior work and other recent neuroimaging studies of meditation. Furthermore, meditators showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between the PCC/ PCu and the left inferior frontal gyrus, whereas novices showed greater functional connectivity during loving kindness between the PCC/ PCu and other cortical midline regions of the default mode network, the bilateral posterior insula lobe, and the bilateral parahippocampus/hippocampus. These novel findings suggest that loving kindness meditation involves a present-centered, selfless focus for meditators as compared to novices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "This study was a randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of meditation practice on the mental health outcomes of female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders. Sixty-three female trauma survivors were randomly assigned to the meditation condition and the control condition. Treatment conditions consisted of a 6-week meditation curriculum that was influenced by Tibetan meditation tradition and focused on breathing, loving kindness, and compassion meditation. Clients in the meditation condition made significant changes in mental health symptoms (t = 5.252, df = 31, p = .000) and trauma symptoms (t = 6.009, df = 31, p = .000) from pre-treatment to post-treatment, whereas non-significant changes were observed among the control condition clients. There were significant group differences between clients in the meditation condition and in the control condition on their mental health symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.438, p = .001, and trauma symptoms, F(1, 54) = 13.395, p = .001, with a generally large effect size of eta squared .127 and .146, respectively. In addition, significantly more clients in the meditation condition achieved reliable change in mental health symptoms (35.5% vs. 8.3%) and trauma symptoms (42.3% vs. 4.8%) than clients in the control condition. Significance of the study is discussed with respect to the empirical evidence of meditation practice as a complementary behavioral intervention for treating female trauma survivors of interpersonal violence who have co-occurring disorders.

        "abstract": "Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) is an efficient mental practice with a long history that has recently attracted interest in the fields of neuroscience, medicine and education. However, the neural characters and underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully illustrated, which has hindered its practical usefulness. This study aimed to investigate LKM from varied aspects and interactions between the brain, the heart, and psychological measurements. A Buddhist monk practitioner was recruited to complete one 10-min LKM practice, in between two 10-min resting tasks (pre- and post-resting) per experimental run. Two sets of single-channel wearable EEG devices were used to collect EEG data (placed at Fz and Pz) and heart rate simultaneously. A self-report evaluation was conducted to repeatedly record the comprehensive performance of mind and body in each session. EEG data were preprossessed and analyzed by EEGlab. Further statistics were made by SPSS. Spectrum analysis showed a significant increase of theta power (Fz: t = -3.356; p = 0.002; Pz: t = -5.199; p < 0.001) and decrease of heart rate between pre- and post-resting tasks (t = 4.092, p < 0.001). The analysis showed a negative correlation between theta power and heart rate (Fz: r = -0.681, p < 0.001; Pz: r = -0.384, p = 0.008), and a positive correlation between theta power and the self-designed report score (Fz: r = 0.601, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that LKM is accompanied by significant neurophysiological changes, mainly an increase in slower frequencies, such as theta, and a decrease in heart rate. More importantly, subjective psychological assessments were also correlated with objective neurophysiological measurements in a long-term meditator participant. During LKM meditation, this connection was stronger. The results of this case report have promising implications for LKM practice in daily life.

        "abstract": "Our Western society is characterized by multitasking, competition, and constant time pressure. Negative effects of stress for the individual (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and for organizations and society (costs due to work absence) are very high. Thus, time-efficient self-help interventions to address these issues are necessary. This study assessed the effects of daily mindfulness meditations (MM) versus daily heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) and daily physical exercise (PE) on attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying. Young adults (n = 75, age range 18 to 40) with elevated stress levels were randomized to MM, HRV-BF, or PE, and measurements were taken at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. Interventions in all three groups were self-guided and lasted for 5 weeks. Generalized estimating equation analyses showed that overall, all three interventions were effective and did not differ from each other. However, practice time differed between groups, with participants in the PE group practicing much more than participants in the other two groups. Therefore, additional analyses were carried out in two subsamples. The optimal dose sample included only those participants who practiced for at least 70 % of the total prescribed time. In the equal dose sample, home practice intensity was equal for all three groups. Again, the effects of the three interventions did not differ. In conclusion, MM, HRV-BF, and PE are all effective self-help methods to improve attention control, executive functioning, mindful awareness, self-compassion, and worrying, and mindfulness meditation was not found to be more effective than HRV-biofeedback or physical exercise for these cognitive processes.

We tested two key pathways of the upward spiral theory of lifestyle change (Fredrickson, 2013), which identifies positive emotions as critical ingredients for the maintenance of new health behaviors. The present experiment combined a laboratory session that introduced novices to meditation with a 3-week follow-up period to assess the extent to which study participants maintained this new health behavior. In a 2 * 2 experimental design, midlife adults (N = 240) were randomized to (a) learn about judicious ways to prioritize positivity (labeled 'prioritizing positivity plus') or about a control topic that also featured the science of positive emotions and (b) follow a guided meditation based on either loving-kindness, which provided an opportunity to self-generate positive emotions, or mindfulness, which did not. All participants rated their emotions following the initial guided meditation and reported, week by week, whether they meditated during the ensuing 21 days. Analyses revealed that being exposed to the prioritizing positivity plus microintervention, relative to a control passage, amplified the effect of engaging in loving-kindness (vs. mindfulness) meditation on positive emotions. Additionally, the degree to which participants experienced positive emotions during first exposure to either meditation type predicted the frequency and duration at which they practiced meditation over the next 21 days. These findings show that the enjoyment of meditation can be experimentally amplified and that initial enjoyment predicts continued practice. Discussion spotlights the importance of differentiating effective and ineffective ways to pursue happiness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesResearch suggests that the quality of life of professional caregivers of individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder can be enhanced through mindfulness-based training. The effects of such training have been evidenced in terms of perceived psychological stress, compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue (i.e., burnout, secondary traumatic stress), and symptoms of depression. In addition to changes in caregiver personal outcomes, mindfulness-based training may have effects on the quality assurance variables of the agency that employs these caregivers. The aim of the present study was to examine the changes from a systems perspective in terms of quality assurance variables related to caregivers and clients in community-based group homes.MethodsProfessional caregivers (n = 216) were randomized into three experimental conditions based on the training they received: mindfulness, psychoeducation, or inservice training-as-usual (control). The effects of the training were assessed in terms of quality assurance indices pertaining to caregivers (progressive discipline, call-ins, days absent, medical referrals, hospitalizations, and caregiver turnover) and clients (learning objectives, behavioral episodes, use of physical restraints, emergency medications [stat], medical emergencies, hospitalizations, aggression to staff, aggression to peers, and level of supervision).ResultsOverall, caregivers in the mindfulness group exhibited significantly fewer progressive discipline and call-ins when compared to the psychoeducation and control groups. Caregivers in both the mindfulness and psychoeducation groups exhibited significantly fewer days of absence from work, medical referrals, and caregiver turnover when compared to the control group. There was no difference across the three groups in terms of hospitalizations. Clients under the care of mindfulness-trained caregivers showed significantly greater improvement in completing learning objectives, fewer behavioral episodes, reduced need for physical restraints and stat medication for behavioral episodes, fewer episodes of aggression to peers, and lower levels of supervision when compared to those in the psychoeducation and control groups. Clients did equally well in terms of medical emergencies, hospitalizations, and aggression to staff in the mindfulness and psychoeducation groups when compared to those in the control group.ConclusionsDifferential effects of mindfulness training, psychoeducation, and inservice training-as-usual were evident in quality assurance variables related to caregivers and clients. The results suggest that training caregivers in different approaches to self-care may differentially affect not only their clinical status but also at a systems level in terms of quality assurance indices.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Decentering has been proposed as a potential mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions but has received limited empirical examination to date in experimental studies comparing mindfulness meditation to active comparison conditions. In the present study, we compared the immediate effects of mindful breathing (MB) to two alternative stress-management techniques: progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) to test whether decentering is unique to mindfulness meditation or common across approaches. Novice meditators (190 female undergraduates) were randomly assigned to complete one of three 15-min stress-management exercises (MB, PMR, or LKM) presented by audio recording. Immediately after the exercise, participants completed measures of decentering, frequency of repetitive thoughts during the exercise, and degree of negative reaction to thoughts. As predicted, participants in the MB condition reported greater decentering relative to the other two conditions. The association between frequency of repetitive thought and negative reactions to thoughts was relatively weaker in the MB condition than in the PMR and LKM conditions, in which these two variables were strongly and positively correlated. Consistent with the construct of decentering, the relative independence between these two variables in the MB condition suggests that mindful breathing may help to reduce reactivity to repetitive thoughts. Taken together, results help to provide further evidence of decentering as a potential mechanism that distinguishes mindfulness practice from other credible stress-management approaches.

        "abstract": "B. L. Fredrickson's (1998, 2001) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions asserts that people's daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n = 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.

Yet, prior research has exclusively examined meditation in relation to average levels of social outcomes (e.g., social connectedness), despite other work demonstrating variability or fluctuations in social functioning play a distinct role in contributing to well-being. This study examined the hypothesis that training in mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation would predict lower variability in social connectedness, even accounting for their positive influence on average levels of social connectedness. Moreover, this study also examined the hypothesis that lower variability in positive and negative emotions would mediate the link between training in meditation and reduced variability in social connectedness. Methods: These hypotheses were tested using a randomized study of 224 mid-life adults. Participants received training in either mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation for 6 weeks. They reported their daily social connectedness and emotions for 2 weeks prior to the training, 6 weeks during the training, and 3 weeks after the training. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, results demonstrated that participants in both meditation groups reported lower variability in social connectedness across the course of the intervention, even accounting for average levels of connectedness. Moreover, lower positive and negative affective variability partially mediated the association between time (training in meditation) and reduced variability in social connectedness. Conclusions: These results suggest that (a) meditation may help to smooth social ups and downs across time and that (b) it may do so via its association with reduced affective variability.

        "abstract": "Meditation is often associated with a relaxed state of the body. However, meditation can also be regarded as a type of mental task and training, associated with mental effort and physiological arousal. The cardiovascular effects of meditation may vary depending on the type of meditation, degree of mental effort, and amount of training. In the current study we assessed heart rate (HR), high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and subjective ratings of effort and likeability during three types of meditation varying in their cognitive and attentional requirements, namely breathing meditation, loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation. In the context of the ReSource project, a one-year longitudinal mental training study, participants practiced each meditation exercise on a daily basis for 3 months. As expected HR and effort were higher during loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared to breathing meditation. With training over time HR and likeability increased, while HF-HRV and the subjective experience of effort decreased. The increase in HR and decrease in HF-HRV over training was higher for loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared to breathing meditation. In contrast to implicit beliefs that meditation is always relaxing and associated with low arousal, the current results show that core meditations aiming at improving compassion and meta-cognitive skills require effort and are associated with physiological arousal compared to breathing meditation. Overall these findings can be useful in making more specific suggestions about which type of meditation is most adaptive for a given context and population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We expected a more positive explicit and implicit evaluation of oneself and a disliked public person after the LKM and a mood improvement. Methods: Before and after the implementation of a short LKM vs. imagery task, mood, explicit and implicit evaluations were analyzed in 69 students.

Conclusions: A possible influence of a short intervention on emotional evaluations should be treated with caution. The claim that a short loving-kindness meditation enhances social connectedness might awake false hopes.

        "abstract": "Based on its role in social processing and stress, oxytocin has been suggested to mediate stress reduction of socio-affective, compassion-based mental training. We tested this hypothesis in the ReSource Project, a 9-month longitudinal mental training study. Participants practiced three different types of mental training, targeting either attentional abilities (Presence Module), socio-affective or socio-cognitive abilities (Affect and Perspective Modules). We investigated plasma oxytocin levels, and their link to cortisol and subjective reactivity to acute psychosocial stress as a function of previous mental training (n = 313). In a subsample (n = 113), to better understand oxytocin's involvement in the effects of socio-affective training, we explored oxytocin, cortisol and subjective experiential responses to a single Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM) conducted after three months of Affect training (versus rest without prior training). We found that, independent of mental training, stress triggered acute oxytocin release. Following a single LKM, however, acute oxytocin release was unaffected. Training effects were only found in overall oxytocin release during both, stress and LKM. Compared to no training, 3-month compassion-based Affect training decreased overall oxytocin levels in the context of psychosocial stress, but increased overall oxytocin levels during LKM. Training-induced changes in overall oxytocin were unrelated to cortisol and subjective stress reactivity. Based on Quintana and Guastella's (2020) theory of oxytocin as an allostatic hormone with anticipatory properties, we interpret training-induced changes in overall oxytocin levels as alterations in the anticipated emotional relevance of specific events. After training socio-affective skills for three months, the stressful situation may have lost its emotional saliency, whereas the meditation technique itself gained emotional relevance. We conclude that changes in peripheral oxytocin release do not mediate stress reduction after mental training, and encourage the investigation of an allostatic concept of oxytocin in future research. - Independent of mental training, oxytocin reacted to stress but was unaffected by Loving-kindness Meditation. - Compassion-based mental training influenced overall oxytocin release during stress and meditation. - Training-induced changes in overall oxytocin release did not mediate stress reduction after mental training.

Healthcare providers commonly endorse weight stigma and bias, contributing to health disparities for patients with 'obesity.' The current study explores the feasibility of the self-compassion loving kindness meditation (LKM) as a brief intervention that reduces weight bias in nursing students. Method Participants (189 nursing students) were randomly assigned to the LKM condition or body scan control condition before engaging in an implicit bias task and answering self-report measures of internalization of the thin ideal, weight bias, positive attitudes towards people with 'obesity,' positive emotions, self-compassion, cognitive flexibility, and compassionate care. Results Statistically significant differences in self-compassion, cognitive flexibility, weight bias, and compassionate care failed to be found between the groups. Participants in the LKM condition endorsed significantly higher levels of positive emotionality compared to the control condition. Higher levels of self-compassion were related to lower levels of weight bias for participants in both conditions. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that internalization of the thin ideal and self-compassion accounted for 19.2% of the variance in positive attitudes towards people with 'obesity.' Conclusions This study suggests the importance of examining self- and other-compassion in the context of weight stigma.

        "abstract": "Objective: Due to a rise in perfectionistic tendencies and growing concerns about the increase in mental health conditions among students this study aimed to examine the effects of a brief intervention in self-compassion on maladaptive perfectionism, anxiety, depression, and body image. Methods: The intervention consisted of four seminars and a silent half-day retreat with short lectures and relevant experiential practices from Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). This randomized wait-list control trial was pre-registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT03453437, Unique Protocol ID: UiBMSC2018). University students were randomly assigned to the intervention group and wait-list control group and filled out surveys weekly. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the groups pre- and post-treatment. Mixed level modeling was used to analyze changes in all outcome measures over time. Results: Eighty-nine participants completed the intervention. Results of the ANOVA showed significant post-intervention reductions in maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies and symptoms of depression and anxiety, in addition to increased self-compassion and improved body image in the intervention group as compared to the wait-list group. Mixed level modeling showed statistically significant changes in self-compassion, maladaptive perfectionism, adaptive perfectionism, anxiety, and depression but not body image. Only the mixed level modeling showed small but significant changes to adaptive perfectionism, also called strivings. Implications of different changes to maladaptive perfectionism than adaptive perfectionism are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a major health and societal issue; there is no treatment to date and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease are not well understood. Yet, there is hope that AD risk factors and thus the number of AD cases can be significantly reduced by prevention measures based on lifestyle modifications as targeted by non-pharmacological preventive interventions. So far, these interventions have rarely targeted the psycho-affective risk factors related to depression, stress, anxiety, and feeling of loneliness, which are all prevalent in ageing. This paper presents the hypothesis that the regular practice of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) in the ageing population constitutes a lifestyle that is protective against AD. In this model, these practices can promote cognition, mental health, and well-being by strengthening attention control, metacognitive monitoring, emotion regulation and pro-social capacities. Training these capacities could reduce the risk of AD by upregulating beneficial age-related factors such as cognitive reserve, and down-regulating detrimental age-related factors, such as stress, or depression. As an illustration, we present the Medit-Ageing study (public name Silver Sante Study), an on-going European project that assesses the impact and mechanisms of non-pharmacological interventions including meditation, in the ageing population. - Preventive interventions target Alzheimer's disease risk factors related to lifestyle. - These interventions yet do not consider explicitly the psycho-affective risk factors. - Mindfulness and loving-kindness meditations promote cognition, and well-being. - They strengthen attention control, metacognitive monitoring and pro-social capacities. - These meditation practices could reduce psycho-affective risk factors of Alzheimer.

        "abstract": "Strong conceptual and theoretical connections have been made between meditation practice, mindfulness, and lucid dreaming. However, only a handful of empirical studies have evaluated the relationship between lucid dreaming and meditation, and conclusions remain tempered by methodological limitations. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between meditation, mindfulness, and lucid dream frequency using several complementary methods. First, using a cross-sectional design, we evaluated differences in lucid dream frequency between long-term meditators and meditation-naive individuals. Second, we evaluated the relationship between lucid dream frequency and specific facets of trait mindfulness in both meditators and nonmeditators. Third, using a blinded, randomized controlled design, we evaluated the effect of an 8-week mindfulness course on lucid dreaming frequency. Our results show that lucid dreaming is more frequent in long-term meditators than in meditation-naive individuals. In addition, lucid dream frequency in meditation-naive individuals was associated with a tendency to verbalize experience, whereas lucid dream frequency in long-term meditators was associated with observational and decentering facets of trait mindfulness. However, an 8-week mindfulness course did not increase the frequency of lucid dreams. Together, these results support a continuity between increased awareness of waking and sleeping states, provide a novel form of evidence linking meditation training to meta-awareness, and support an association between meditation practice and lucid dreaming, but leave open the specific nature of this connection.

        "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the association between positive emotions and physical health remain a mystery. We hypothesize that an upward-spiral dynamic continually reinforces the tie between positive emotions and physical health and that this spiral is mediated by people's perceptions of their positive social connections. We tested this overarching hypothesis in a longitudinal field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group that self-generated positive emotions via loving-kindness meditation or to a waiting-list control group. Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions relative to those in the control group, an effect moderated by baseline vagal tone, a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions, in turn, produced increases in vagal tone, an effect mediated by increased perceptions of social connections. This experimental evidence identifies one mechanism-perceptions of social connections-through which positive emotions build physical health, indexed as vagal tone. Results suggest that positive emotions, positive social connections, and physical health influence one another in a self-sustaining upward-spiral dynamic. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "abstract": "Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have revealed that meditation is associated with structural brain changes in regions underlying cognitive processes that are required for attention or mindfulness during meditation. This VBM study examined brain changes related to the practice of an emotion-oriented meditation: loving-kindness meditation (LKM). A 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner captured images of the brain structures of 25 men, 10 of whom had practiced LKM in the Theravada tradition for at least 5 years. Compared with novices, more gray matter volume was detected in the right angular and posterior parahippocampal gyri in LKM experts. The right angular gyrus has not been previously reported to have structural differences associated with meditation, and its specific role in mind and cognitive empathy theory suggests the uniqueness of this finding for LKM practice. These regions are important for affective regulation associated with empathic response, anxiety and mood. At the same time, gray matter volume in the left temporal lobe in the LKM experts appeared to be greater, an observation that has also been reported in previous MRI meditation studies on meditation styles other than LKM. Overall, the findings of our study suggest that experience in LKM may influence brain structures associated with affective regulation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Because mindfulness meditation training aims at \"nonconceptual awareness\" which involves a reduced influence of habitual verbal-conceptual processes on the interpretation of ongoing experience, mindfulness may facilitate insight problem solving. This hypothesis was examined across two studies (total N =157). Participants in both studies completed a measure of trait mindfulness and a series of insight and noninsight problems. Further, participants in Study 2 completed measures of positive affect and a mindfulness or control training. The results indicated that (a) trait mindfulness predicts better insight but not noninsight problem solving (both studies), (b) this relation is maintained when controlling for positive affect (Study 2), (c) mindfulness training improves insight but not noninsight problem solving (Study 2) and (d) this improvement is partially mediated by state mindfulness (Study 2). These findings are the first to document a direct relation between mindfulness and creativity. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]",

        "abstract": "Stress-activated gene * environment interactions may contribute to individual variability in blood pressure reductions from behavioral interventions. We investigated effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) LYS198ASN SNP and discriminatory stress exposure upon impact of 12-week behavioral interventions upon ambulatory BP (ABP) among 162 prehypertensive African American adolescents. Following genotyping, completion of questionnaire battery, and 24-hour ABP monitoring, participants were randomized to health education control (HEC), life skills training (LST), or breathing awareness meditation (BAM). Postintervention ABP was obtained. Significant three-way interactions on ABP changes indicated that among ET-1 SNP carriers, the only group to show reductions was BAM from low chronic stress environments. Among ET-1 SNP noncarriers, under low chronic stress exposure, all approaches worked, especially BAM. Among high stress exposure noncarriers, only BAM resulted in reductions. If these preliminary findings are replicated via ancillary analyses of archival databases and then via efficacy trials, selection of behavioral prescriptions for prehypertensives will be edging closer to being guided by individual's underlying genetic and environmental factors incorporating the healthcare model of personalized preventive medicine.

        "abstract": "Many philosophical and contemplative traditions teach that \"living in the moment\" increases happiness. However, the default mode of humans appears to be that of mind-wandering, which correlates with unhappiness, and with activation in a network of brain areas associated with self-referential processing. We investigated brain activity in experienced meditators and matched meditation-naive controls as they performed several different meditations (Concentration, Loving-Kindness, Choiceless Awareness). We found that the main nodes of the default-mode network (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) were relatively deactivated in experienced meditators across all meditation types. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger coupling in experienced meditators between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (regions previously implicated in self-monitoring and cognitive control), both at baseline and during meditation. Our findings demonstrate differences in the default-mode network that are consistent with decreased mind-wandering. As such, these provide a unique understanding of possible neural mechanisms of meditation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Abstract: The beneficial effects of mindful awareness and mindfulness meditation training on physical and psychological health are thought to be mediated in part through changes in underlying brain processes. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) allows identification of functional networks in the brain. It has been used to examine state-dependent activity and is well suited for studying states such as meditation. We applied fcMRI to determine if Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training is effective in altering intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Healthy women were randomly assigned to participate in an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training course or an 8-week waiting period. After 8weeks, fMRI data (1.5T) was acquired while subjects rested with eyes closed, with the instruction to pay attention to the sounds of the scanner environment. Group independent component analysis was performed to investigate training-related changes in functional connectivity. Significant MBSR-related differences in functional connectivity were found mainly in auditory/salience and medial visual networks. Relative to findings in the control group, MBSR subjects showed (1) increased functional connectivity within auditory and visual networks, (2) increased functional connectivity between auditory cortex and areas associated with attentional and self-referential processes, (3) stronger anticorrelation between auditory and visual cortex, and (4) stronger anticorrelation between visual cortex and areas associated with attentional and self-referential processes. These findings suggest that 8weeks of mindfulness meditation training alters intrinsic functional connectivity in ways that may reflect a more consistent attentional focus, enhanced sensory processing, and reflective awareness of sensory experience.

However, little is known about whether intervention activities remain effective in the long term, or whether new resources are maintained after the intervention ends. We address these issues in a 15-month follow-up survey of participants from a loving-kindness meditation intervention. Many participants continued to practice meditation, and they reported more positive emotions (PEs) than those who had stopped meditating or had never meditated. All participants maintained gains in resources made during the initial intervention, whether or not they continued meditating. Continuing meditators did not differ on resources at baseline, but they did show more PE and a more rapid PE response to the intervention.

Meditators were predicted to show greater gray matter concentration in regions that are typically activated during meditation. Results confirmed greater gray matter concentration for meditators in the right anterior insula, which is involved in interoceptive awareness. This group difference presumably reflects the training of bodily awareness during mindfulness meditation. Furthermore, meditators had greater gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus. Both regions have previously been found to be involved in meditation. The mean value of gray matter concentration in the left inferior temporal gyrus was predictable by the amount of meditation training, corroborating the assumption of a causal impact of meditation training on gray matter concentration in this region. Results suggest that meditation practice is associated with structural differences in regions that are typically activated during meditation and in regions that are relevant for the task of meditation.

Negative cognitions and difficulties in emotional regulation can increase and amplify pain. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention known as Flow Meditation (Meditacion-Fluir) on different variables (i.e., catastrophizing, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence) related to emotion regulation and pain management in individuals with FMS. Methods: Forty-four women diagnosed with fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to a 7-week Flow Meditation group intervention (intervention group; n = 22) or waiting-list control group (n = 22). Measures were taken at three different times: pretest, post-test, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Findings revealed significant improvements in pain catastrophizing (rumination, magnification, and helplessness), adaptive coping strategies (active versus passive), and emotional intelligence, which were maintained until the 3-month follow-up assessment. Effect sizes range from moderate to high, most notably for the Rumination and Despair components of pain catastrophizing, and for emotional intelligence. Conclusions: Flow Meditation shows promise for alleviating negative distorted thinking and improving adaptive coping as part of pain management in female fibromyalgia patients.

        "abstract": "Objectives: Previous studies have supported the idea that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could reduce burnout but lack theory-based explorations of the underlying mechanisms. The integrative view of job demands-resources theory and self-regulation suggests that self-regulation is crucial for coping with job burnout. Based on this theoretical point of view, the present research investigated the effect of MBIs on burnout and the potential mediation between burnout and specific self-regulation traits, including mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-control. Methods: Study 1 (N = 342; 19.9% managers and 19.9% technologists) collected cross-sectional data utilizing network analysis to explore the complex relations between self-regulation and burnout. Study 2 (N = 156; 30.8% teachers) conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) on burnout and the mediating role of the three self-regulation components. Results: (1) Self-compassion was more related to initiatory than inhibitory self-control; (2) acting with awareness, self-compassion, and inhibitory and initiatory self-control played important roles in the self-regulation and burnout network; (3) MBPP could significantly improve mindfulness, self-control, and self-compassion while protecting against burnout; and (4) acting with awareness mediated the effect of inhibitory self-control on depersonalization. Conclusions: MBPP has the potential to protect against burnout. Self-regulation mediated the intervention effect on burnout, which supported the integrative view on burnout in MBIs. The findings also supported the necessity to differentiate subcomponents of self-compassion and self-control and suggested a new mechanism by which self-control could benefit the application of mindfulness.

We use a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with a time-matched psychoeducation control to test MMWR effects on residential treatment retention. We used clinical staff-determined residential site discharge status and discharge date from the SUD treatment site record to determine retention. We tested for study group differences in retention defined as time to treatment non-completion without improvement (i.e., patient left treatment before completion of the treatment plan and made little or no progress toward achieving treatment goals based on clinical team determination), as well as differences in self-report of study intervention mechanisms of action (i.e., mindfulness, perceived stress, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, distress, affect, and drug and alcohol craving). The analytic timeframe for the survival analysis was from study intervention start date to 150 days later. The sample (N = 200) was female, majority amphetamine/methamphetamine users (76%), Hispanic (58%), with a history of incarceration (62%). By the 150-day analytic endpoint, the sample had 74 (37%) treatment Completers, 42 (21%) still In-residence, 26 (13%) Non-completers with satisfactory progress, and 58 (29%) Non-completers without satisfactory progress. Survival analysis of the intent-to-treat sample showed the risk of non-completion without improvement was lower in MMWR as compared to the control group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.16-1.08, p = .07). Both groups improved on select self-reported mechanism measure scores at immediate post-intervention, but only in the MMWR group did class attendance (dosage) have a large-size correlation with improved mindfulness (r = .61, p < .01), distress tolerance (r = 0.55, p < .01) and positive affect (r = 0.52, p < .01) scores.

METHOD: Remitted depressed outpatients entered a 24-month clinical follow up after either 8 weekly group sessions of cognitive therapy (CT; N = 84) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; N = 82). The primary outcome was symptom return meeting the criteria for major depression on Module A of the SCID. RESULTS: Factor analysis identified three latent factors (53% of the variance): decentering (DC), distress tolerance (DT), and residual symptoms (RS), which were equivalent across CT and MBCT. Latent change score modeling of factor slopes over the follow up revealed positive slopes for DC (beta = .177), and for DT (beta = .259), but not for RS (beta = -.017), indicating posttreatment growth in DC and DT, but no change in RS. Cox regression indicated that DC slope was a significant predictor of relapse/recurrence prophylaxis, Hazard Ratio (HR) = .232 90% Confidence Interval (CI) [.067, .806], controlling for past depressive episodes, treatment group, and medication. The practice of therapy-acquired regulatory skills had no direct effect on relapse/recurrence (beta = .028) but predicted relapse/recurrence through an indirect path (beta = -.125), such that greater practice of regulatory skills following treatment promoted increases in DC (beta = .462), which, in turn, predicted a reduced risk of relapse/recurrence over 24 months (beta = -.270). CONCLUSIONS: Preventing major depressive disorder relapse/recurrence may depend upon developing DC in addition to managing residual symptoms. Following the acquisition of therapy skills during maintenance psychotherapies, DC is strengthened by continued skill utilization beyond treatment termination.

Previous studies have indicated that mindfulness and other forms of meditation training are associated with improvements in sleep quality. However, none of these studies used objective PSG sleep recordings within longitudinal randomized controlled trials of naive subjects. METHODS: Twenty-six individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) course or a waitlist control condition. Pre-post measurements included PSG sleep studies and subjectively reported sleep and depression symptoms. RESULTS: According to PSG sleep, MM practice was associated with several indices of increased cortical arousal, including more awakenings and stage 1 sleep and less slow-wave sleep relative to controls, in proportion to amount of MM practice. According to sleep diaries, subjectively reported sleep improved post MBCT but not above and beyond controls. Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased more in the MBCT group than controls. Improvements in depression were associated with increased subjective sleep continuity and increased PSG arousal. CONCLUSIONS: MM is associated with increases in objectively measured arousal during sleep with simultaneous improvements in subjectively reported sleep quality and mood disturbance. This pattern is similar to the profiles of positive responders to common antidepressant medications.",

The present study was conducted to outline the effectiveness of mindfulness-based educational intervention in the psychological well-being of women as the heads of households. METHODS: This research as a semi-experimental study was done by pretest-posttest design and control group. The study statistical population included all women as the heads of households in Shiraz, who had a file in the Shiraz based welfare office and at the same time their children were studying in schools covered by the 2nd district educational department of Shiraz in 2022-2023. Out of the female heads of the households in the statistical community, 30 women were selected as Purposive sampling and then randomly divided into two 15-individual groups, including experimental group (training on mindfulness-based therapy) and control group. The research tool included Ryff's psychological well-being scale (Ryff, 1989). The experimental group was subjected to training on mindfulness-based therapy (Baer et al., 2006) during eight 90-min sessions. However, the control group did not receive any intervention. RESULT: After running the intervention, a significant difference was seen between the components of autonomy, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, positive relationship with others, and psychological well-being after running the educational intervention between the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05), while no meaningful difference popped up between the experimental and control groups in terms of environmental mastery as one of the aspects measured in psychological well-being scale after the educational intervention (P = 0.602). CONCLUSION: According to the results, it seems that psychologists can benefit from the method of training on mindfulness-based therapy in order to increase the psychological well-being of women as the heads of households.",

As most evidence for the beneficial effects comes from convenience samples in the social/education/health sector, it is still an open question if MBIs are effective in other contexts, or for whom MBIs are more effective. In addition, self-selection and sample characteristics may have biased previous findings. Theoretically and practically, it is important to know whether MBIs are also effective for nonselective samples outside the social and health sector, especially in agentic and male-oriented cultures. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of a MBI on physiological and psychological criteria in a nonselective sample of police officers. Moreover, this study examines whether effectiveness depends on participants' personality (neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness) and on perceived social norms toward MBIs. Using a pre-post intervention design, N = 267 police officers were randomly assigned to an intervention group receiving a 6-week intervention and to a control group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a positive effect on heart rate variability and a stronger reduction of psychological strain, health complaints, and negative affect, as well as more improvement of mindfulness and self-care in the intervention group in comparison with the control group. Additionally, participants higher in neuroticism and openness benefitted more, and the effectiveness was stronger for those who perceived a favorable social norm toward MBIs. Our findings provide evidence that participants with male-oriented occupations may also benefit from a MBI. The importance of individual differences and the social context is discussed.

        "title": "The impact of Tai Chi and mind-body breathing in COPD: Insights from a qualitative sub-study of a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with multiple psychosocial and behavioral factors. Prior research suggests that mind-body interventions may support the development and maintenance of healthy behaviors and improve health-related quality-of-life in such patients. We sought to qualitatively explore cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral changes in patients with COPD who participated in two different mind-body interventions compared to an education control. METHODS: We analyzed semi-structured qualitative exit interviews from a prospective, randomized pilot trial (N = 123) investigating 12-weeks of Tai Chi (TC) vs. mind-body breathing (MBB) vs. education (EDU) control in patients with moderate-severe COPD. TC involved traditional movements, that integrate meditative breathing, while MBB focused mainly on meditative breathing techniques alone. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis of randomly selected transcripts was performed by two independent reviewers using an iterative process to identify emergent themes informed by grounded theory methods until thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS: A total of 66 transcripts were reviewed (N = 22 TC, N = 22 MBB, N = 22 EDU). Participants were mean age = 68.1 years, GOLD Stage = 2.3, baseline FEV11 percent predicted mean (SD): 58% (13.4), 42.4% female. We identified six frequently mentioned themes: 1) overall awareness and understanding, 2) self-care knowledge, skills and behaviors, 3) behavior-related neurocognitive concepts, 4) physical function, 5) psychological well-being, and 6) social support/social function. Compared to EDU, more participants in TC and MBB noted improvements in awareness of self and the mind-body connection (e.g., body and breath awareness), knowledge of breathing techniques and integration of self-care skills with daily activities, self-efficacy for symptom management (particularly managing anxiety and dyspnea), acceptance of disease, physical function improvements (e.g., endurance, dyspnea, fatigue), and psychological well-being (particularly relaxation, emotion regulation and decreased reactivity). Compared to MBB, those in TC shared more intention to continue with self-care behaviors, physical activity self-efficacy, and improved flexibility. All three groups, including EDU, noted increased social support and knowledge of disease. Those in EDU, however, had fewer mentions of processes related to behavior change, and less concrete changes in neurocognitive, psychological, and physical function domains. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body interventions including meditative breathing may impact behavior-related neurocognitive and emotional factors that improve self-care management and support positive behavioral changes in patients with COPD.

        "abstract": "Older adults often avoid seeking psychological treatment, thus challenging their ability to cope effectively with anxiety, stress, and depression. The current study aimed to compare the effects of a mindfulness intervention with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on measures of emotional distress and attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment among older adults. Twenty-four seniors were assigned to three groups: (1) Mindfulness-based intervention for seniors (MBIS), (2) CBT for anxiety, or (3) a care-as-usual control group. Participants in the two intervention groups of eight weekly sessions were randomly assigned. Results showed that attitudes toward seeking psychological treatment and depression, anxiety, and worry levels were evaluated before and after the interventions. Following both interventions, participants considered the prospect of utilizing psychological treatment more positively, whereas no changes were observed in the control group. Interestingly, worry levels were eased only in the MBIS group, and anxiety levels were eased only in the CBT group. Our findings support the understanding that cognitive group interventions can effectively achieve their intended aim (decreasing worry or anxiety) and positively impact attitudes toward psychological treatment.Trial registration: clinicaltrials, NCT04165005, 15/11/19.",

        "abstract": "Despite emerging evidence suggesting positive outcomes of mindfulness training for the self-management of other neurodegenerative diseases, limited research has explored its effect on the self-management of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to characterize the experiences of individuals participating in a facilitated, group mindfulness-based lifestyle program for community living adults with Stage 2 PD and explore how the program influenced beliefs about self-management of their disease. Our longitudinal qualitative study was embedded within a randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a 6-week mindfulness-based lifestyle program on patient-reported function. The study was set in Melbourne, Australia in 2012-2013. We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants before, immediately after, and 6 months following participation in the program. Sixteen participants were interviewed prior to commencing the program. Of these, 12 were interviewed shortly after its conclusion, and 9 interviewed at 6 months. Prior to the program, participants felt a lack of control over their illness. A desire for control and a need for alternative tools for managing the progression of PD motivated many to engage with the program. Following the program, where participants experienced an increase in mindfulness, many became more accepting of disease progression and reported improved social relationships and self-confidence in managing their disease. Mindfulness-based lifestyle programs have the potential for increasing both participants' sense of control over their reactions to disease symptoms as well as social connectedness. Community-based mindfulness training may provide participants with tools for self-managing a number of the consequences of Stage 2 PD.",

        "abstract": "People with diabetes frequently have elevated diabetes distress. Although mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) therapy has been shown effective in reducing diabetes distress, it has only been delivered by psychologists or a multidisciplinary team with an attrition rate of up to 39%, which limits its dissemination to a broader audience. This study was aimed to pilot evaluate the feasibility of a nurse-led MBSR therapy and explore its potential efficacy amongst people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 100 participants were randomly allocated either to the intervention group (nurse-led MBSR therapy + regular diabetes education) or the control group (regular diabetes education). Data on diabetes distress, diabetes self-efficacy, and diabetes self-management were collected at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was collected at baseline and 12 weeks. A generalized estimating equation analysis for repeated measures was used to determine intervention and time effects. As predicted, the nurse-led MBSR therapy had a significant time-by-group interaction effect on diabetes distress total score (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.77, p < 0.001), diabetes self-efficacy (95% CI: -0.93 to -0.74, p < 0.001), diabetes self-management (95% CI: -10.80 to -7.83, p < 0.001), and HbA1c levels (95% CI: 0.04-1.14, p = 0.03) in the intervention group compared with the control group over 12 weeks. This is the first nurse-led MBSR therapy in a hospital setting that is feasible and has the potential to improve health outcomes. This approach may offer an innovative model to deliver MBSR therapy. A randomized controlled trial comparing the nurse-led MBSR plus usual diabetes education with usual diabetes education along with a mechanism to equalize intervention attention between the groups is indicated.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stress negatively impacts upon physical and mental health. Pharmacy students demonstrate higher stress than the general population. Mindfulness may improve pharmacy students' stress and distress levels. The purpose of this study was to assess the quantitative effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on pharmacy student stress, distress, burnout, and mindfulness levels. METHODS: A quasi-randomised controlled trial was conducted at an Irish pharmacy school during the 2016 to 2017 academic year. The intervention group completed a four-week mindfulness course. The waitlist control group received only usual education. Participants completed a demographics form, the Perceived Stress Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Student Survey, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire at baseline and immediately post-intervention. RESULTS: Full data were gathered and analysed for 99 students (51 intervention, 48 control, 66.7% female). There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline. Post-intervention, a large effect on mental distress was found (Partial Eta Squared 0.137) with the intervention group reporting statistically significantly lower distress than the control group (F (1,98) = 15.3, p < 0.005). Stress and distress were significantly improved for females (p = 0.026, p < 0.005), while males improved in the observing facet of mindfulness (p = 0.038). There was a positive association between attendance and these findings (r2 = 0.191, p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Female pharmacy students experienced improvements in mental distress and stress after participation in the intervention. Mindfulness may have a future role to play in pharmacy and healthcare education.",

        "title": "Increased high-frequency NREM EEG power associated with mindfulness-based interventions for chronic insomnia: Preliminary findings from spectral analysis.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to reduce subjective symptoms of insomnia but the effects on objective measures remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine sleep EEG microarchitecture patterns from a randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI). METHODS: Sleep EEG spectral analysis was conducted on 36 participants with chronic insomnia (>6 months) randomized to 8-week MBSR, MBTI, or self-monitoring control (SM). Overnight polysomnography with 6-channel EEG was conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Spectral power averaged from channels C3/C4 across NREM epochs (excluding N1) was examined for within-group changes and relationships with self-report measures. RESULTS: Increases in absolute NREM beta (16-25 Hz) power were observed from baseline to post-treatment (p = .02, d = 0.53) and maintained at 6-month follow-up (p = .01, d = 0.57) in the combined MBI groups, and additionally in the gamma (25-40 Hz) range at follow-up for the MBTI group only. No significant changes in these frequency bands were observed for SM. Following mindfulness intervention, NREM beta was positively associated with Five-Facet Mindfulness (FFM) score (rho = 0.37, p = .091) and negatively associated with Insomnia Severity Index (rho = -0.43, p = .047). CONCLUSION: These results in people with insomnia corroborate prior reports of increased high-frequency sleep EEG power associated with mindfulness training. This change in beta EEG pattern merits further evaluation as a potential marker of the effects of mindfulness meditation on sleep, especially given the paradoxical findings in the context of insomnia.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Embedded within a randomized efficacy trial, the present study aimed to investigate whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for recurrent depression improved symptoms of insomnia. METHODS: Sixty-eight remitted participants with at least three prior episodes of depression were randomized to 8 weeks of MBCT (n = 33) or a waitlist control condition (n = 35). The Bergen Insomnia Scale was used to screen for insomnia symptoms before and after the intervention. The analyses were conducted using one-way between-groups analyses of covariance. RESULTS: Twenty-five MBCT participants and 30 waitlist controls completed the study (74.5% females; mean age 40.7 \u00b1 12.9 years). At baseline, 83.6% screened positive for the insomnia diagnosis. Following the intervention and after controlling for corresponding insomnia parameters at baseline, MBCT completers reported significantly less severe insomnia symptoms (p = 0.017), as well as less problems with prolonged sleep onset (p = 0.047) and nocturnal awakenings (p = 0.023), relative to controls. No group differences were found on early morning awakening, daytime impairment, or dissatisfaction with sleep. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that MBCT improves certain insomnia symptoms. However, additional sleep-specific interventions may be needed to further improve this population's sleep.Clinical Trial Registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN18001392, registered 22/11/2018.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The opioid crisis in the USA remains severe during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced access to evidence-based interventions. This Stage 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed the preliminary efficacy of Zoom-based Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) plus Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) prompts to practice mindfulness triggered by wearable sensors (MORE + JITAI). METHOD: Opioid-treated chronic pain patients (n = 63) were randomized to MORE + JITAI or a Zoom-based supportive group (SG) psychotherapy control. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of craving and pain (co-primary outcomes), as well as positive affect, and stress at one random probe per day for 90 days. EMA probes were also triggered when a wearable sensor detected the presence of physiological stress, as indicated by changes in heart rate variability (HRV), at which time participants in MORE + JITAI were prompted by an app to engage in audio-guided mindfulness practice. RESULTS: EMA showed significantly greater reductions in craving, pain, and stress, and increased positive affect over time for participants in MORE + JITAI than for participants in SG. JITAI-initiated mindfulness practice was associated with significant improvements in these variables, as well as increases in HRV. Machine learning predicted JITAI-initiated mindfulness practice effectiveness with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot trial, MORE + JITAI demonstrated preliminary efficacy for reducing opioid craving and pain, two factors implicated in opioid misuse. MORE + JITAI is a promising intervention that warrants investigation in a fully powered RCT. PREREGISTRATION: This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04567043).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One-third or more of breast cancer survivors report stress and other psychological and physical complaints that can negatively impact their quality of life. Psychosocial stress management interventions, shown to mitigate the negative impact of these complaints, can now be delivered as accessible and convenient (for the patient and provider) eHealth interventions. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), Coping After Breast Cancer (CABC), 2 modified versions of the stress management eHealth intervention program StressProffen were created: one with predominantly cognitive behavioral stress management content (StressProffen-cognitive behavioral therapy intervention [StressProffen-CBI]) and another with predominantly mindfulness-based stress management content (StressProffen-mindfulness-based intervention [StressProffen-MBI]). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects in breast cancer survivors of using StressProffen-CBI and StressProffen-MBI compared with a control group (treatment as usual). METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I-III, unequivocally human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative tumors) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) aged 21-69 years who completed the Cancer Registry of Norway-initiated health survey on quality of life are invited to the CABC trial about 7 months after diagnosis. Women who give consent to participate are randomized (1:1:1) to either the StressProffen-CBI, StressProffen-MBI, or control group. Both StressProffen interventions consist of 10 modules of stress management content delivered through text, sound, video, and images. The primary outcome is between-group changes in perceived stress at 6 months, assessed with Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. The secondary outcomes comprise changes in quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep, neuropathy, coping, mindfulness, and work-related outcomes approximately 1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis. Long-term effects of the interventions on work participation, comorbidities, relapse or new cancers, and mortality will be assessed using data from national health registries. RESULTS: Recruitment is scheduled from January 2021 to May 2023. The goal is to recruit 430 participants (100 in each group). As of April 14 2023, 428 participants have been enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: The CABC trial is possibly the largest ongoing psychosocial eHealth RCT in patients with breast cancer. If 1 or both interventions prove to be effective in reducing stress and improving psychosocial and physical complains, the StressProffen eHealth interventions could be beneficial, inexpensive, and easily implementable tools for breast cancer survivors when coping with late effects after cancer and cancer treatments.

        "title": "Effect of the Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Anxiety and Depression Status of COVID-19 Patients Treated in Fangcang Hospitals: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the focal point of epidemic prevention and control, the mental health of COVID-19 patients cannot be ignored. Online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) allows for the provision of conveniently accessible, effective and low-cost interventions on a large scale. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of an online MBSR intervention in alleviating anxiety and depression among asymptomatic/mild patients limited by COVID-19-related restrictions. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients treated in Sanya Fangcang hospital were randomly allocated to either to the experimental group (n = 29) following daily, for 5 days, an online-based mindfulness intervention or to the control group (n = 29). Patients from both groups underwent online questionnaires including assessment of anxiety and depression status at pre- and post-tests using Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. RESULTS: After the online-based MBSR program, the anxiety and depression scores of the patients in the MBSR group decreased significantly in comparison to the scores of those in the control group (respectively \u03b7(2) = 0.175, \u03b7(2) = 0.215, p < 0.001). And the proportion of severe anxiety and depression patients in the MBSR group decreased to 0% which lower than the control group, and the proportion of light anxiety and depression patients was significantly more than that in the control group after the MBSR intervention. CONCLUSION: The online-based MBSR intervention appears to be an effective way of alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms among COVID-19 patients with associated quarantine in Fangcang hospital. Given the seriousness of mental health threat that could be posed by this ongoing pandemic, our study provides a new idea and method for cost-effective and time-efficient interventions in the future of epidemic prevention and control.",

        "title": "Philosophy for children and mindfulness during COVID-19: Results from a randomized cluster trial and impact on mental health in elementary school students.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on children's mental health. Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Around 40-50% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from obsessions and compulsions after receiving first-line treatments. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been proposed as a reasonable augmentation strategy for OCD. MBCT trains to decentre from distressful thoughts and emotions by focusing on them voluntarily and with consciousness. This practice develops alternative ways to deal with obsessions, which could increase non-reactivity behaviours and, in turn, reduce compulsions. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of MBCT to improve OCD symptoms. Secondly, it pursues to investigate which socio-demographic, clinical, and neurobiological characteristics mediate or moderate the MBCT response; and identify potential biomarkers of positive/negative response. METHODS: This study is a randomised clinical trial (RCT) of 60 OCD patients who do not respond to first-line treatments. Participants will be randomised to either an MBCT program or treatment as usual. The MBCT group will undergo 10 weekly sessions of 120min. Principal outcome: change in OCD severity symptoms using clinician and self-reported measures. Also, participants will undergo a comprehensive evaluation assessing comorbid clinical variables, neuropsychological functioning and thought content. Finally, a comprehensive neuroimaging protocol using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging will be acquired in a 3T scanner. All data will be obtained at baseline and post-intervention. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the efficacy of mindfulness in OCD patients who do not achieve clinical recovery after usual treatment. It is the first RCT in this subject examining clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging variables to examine the neural patterns associated with the MBCT response.

        "abstract": "The present randomized pilot intervention study examines the effects of a mindfulness-based self-leadership training (MBSLT) specifically developed for academic achievement situations. Both mindfulness and self-leadership have a strong self-regulatory focus and are helpful in terms of stress resilience and performance enhancements. Based on several theoretical points of contact and a specific interplay between mindfulness and self-leadership, the authors developed an innovative intervention program that improves mood as well as performance in a real academic setting. The intervention was conducted as a randomized controlled study over 10 weeks. The purpose was to analyze the effects on perceived stress, test anxiety, academic self-efficacy, and the performance of students by comparing an intervention and control group (n = 109). Findings demonstrated significant effects on mindfulness, self-leadership, academic self-efficacy, and academic performance improvements in the intervention group. Results showed that the intervention group reached significantly better grade point averages than the control group. Moreover, the MBSLT over time led to a reduction of test anxiety in the intervention group compared to the control group. Furthermore, while participants of the control group showed an increase in stress over time, participants of the intervention group maintained constant stress levels over time. The combination of mindfulness and self-leadership addressed both positive effects on moods and on objective academic performance. The effects demonstrate the great potential of combining mindfulness with self-leadership to develop a healthy self-regulatory way of attaining achievement-related goals and succeeding in high-stress academic environments.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week Qigong intervention to improve objectively and subjectively assessed cognitive function in breast cancer survivors who were 2 months to 8 years post completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, three-arm intervention pilot was conducted to compare Qigong to gentle exercise and survivorship support. Feasibility was measured by recruitment, group session attendance, and adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups. Changes in self-report and objectively measured cognitive function were compared between the three groups from baseline (T1) to completion of the intervention (T2) and 4 weeks post intervention (T3). RESULTS: Fifty participants consented (83% of desired sample) with an overall attrition rate of 28%. Attrition was highest for the gentle exercise group (50%). Group attendance adherence ranged from 44 to 67%. The a priori established rate of 75% weekly attendance was not achieved, nor was the goal of 75% adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups (7 to 41%). Self-report of cognitive function improved most for the Qigong group (p = .01). Improvement was demonstrated for the Trail Making A (gentle exercise, p = .007) and F-A-S verbal fluency (support group, p = .02) tests. Qigong participants reported the most reduction of distress (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that mindfulness-based exercise may be superior to gentle exercise alone or survivorship support for improving self-report of cognitive function and distress after treatment for breast cancer. The mindfulness component may enhance the positive impact of exercise on cognitive function.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this preregistered, secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT02717429) was to compare the impact of 4-week mindfulness-based training and adaptive cognitive training, with a waitlist control condition, on processing speed and working memory in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). METHOD: Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to mindfulness-based training (MBT), adaptive computerized cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist (WL) control group and completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests at pre- and posttraining. Training-related changes on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were the primary outcomes of interest. Baseline cognitive status was examined as a moderator of treatment gains. Practice time, change in aCT game difficulty, and rate of change in state awareness across MBT were assessed as correlates of cognitive gains. FINDINGS: Compared with aCT and WL, mindfulness training significantly improved processing speed (\u03b7(p)2 = .14). Baseline cognitive status did not moderate change in processing speed (\u03b7(p)2 = .005) or working memory (\u03b7(p)2 = .014). Practice time and change in game difficulty were not significantly correlated with cognitive gains (all ps > .49). In the MBT group, rate of change in awareness was significantly associated with improvement in working memory (\u03c1 = .52, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: In PwMS, 4 weeks of mindfulness meditation training improved processing speed above and beyond aCT and WL. More rapid change in awareness during mindfulness training may be associated with greater gains in working memory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",

        "title": "The Process-Outcome Mindfulness Effects in Trainees (PrOMET) study: protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has its origins in an Eastern Buddhist tradition that is over 2500 years old and can be defined as a specific form of attention that is non-judgmental, purposeful, and focused on the present moment. It has been well established in cognitive-behavior therapy in the last decades, while it has been investigated in manualized group settings such as mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. However, there is scarce research evidence on the effects of mindfulness as a treatment element in individual therapy. Consequently, the demand to investigate mindfulness under effectiveness conditions in trainee therapists has been highlighted. METHODS/DESIGN: To fill in this research gap, we designed the PrOMET Study. In our study, we will investigate the effects of brief, audiotape-presented, session-introducing interventions with mindfulness elements conducted by trainee therapists and their patients at the beginning of individual therapy sessions in a prospective, randomized, controlled design under naturalistic conditions with a total of 30 trainee therapists and 150 patients with depression and anxiety disorders in a large outpatient training center. We hypothesize that the primary outcomes of the session-introducing intervention with mindfulness elements will be positive effects on therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) and general clinical symptomatology (Brief Symptom Checklist) in contrast to the session-introducing progressive muscle relaxation and treatment-as-usual control conditions. Treatment duration is 25 therapy sessions. Therapeutic alliance will be assessed on a session-to-session basis. Clinical symptomatology will be assessed at baseline, session 5, 15 and 25. We will conduct multilevel modeling to address the nested data structure. The secondary outcome measures include depression, anxiety, interpersonal functioning, mindful awareness, and mindfulness during the sessions. DISCUSSION: The study results could provide important practical implications because they could inform ideas on how to improve the clinical training of psychotherapists that could be implemented very easily; this is because there is no need for complex infrastructures or additional time concerning these brief session-introducing interventions with mindfulness elements that are directly implemented in the treatment sessions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: From ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT02270073 (registered October 6, 2014).",

        "title": "The effectiveness of a school mindfulness-based intervention on the neural correlates of inhibitory control in children at risk: A randomized control trial.",
        "abstract": "Interest in the applications of mindfulness practice in education is growing in the scientific community. Recent research has shown that mindfulness practice in schools may be beneficial for executive functions (EFs) which are abilities crucial for healthy development. The study of the effects of mindfulness practices on children's neural correlates of EFs, particularly inhibitory control, may provide relevant information about the impact and mechanisms of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in children. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a MBI in elementary school children on the neural correlates of inhibitory control via a randomized controlled trial. Children from two 4th grade classrooms and two 5th grade classrooms located in a school identified as having low socioeconomic status in Santiago de Chile were randomly assigned to either receive a MBI or serve as active controls and receive a social skills program. Both before and after the interventions, electroencephalographic activity was recorded during a modified version of the Go/Nogo task in a subsample of children in each group. Additionally, teachers completed questionnaires of students' EFs and students completed self-report measures. Results revealed increases in EFs assessed by questionnaires together with improved P3 amplitude associated with successful response inhibition in children who received the MBI compared to active controls. These results contribute to the understanding of the ways in which mindfulness practices can promote the development of inhibitory control together with EF improvement, factors identified as critical for children's social and emotional development and positive mental health. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: This study investigated the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention in children from a low socioeconomic status school on neural correlates of EFs. Children performed a Go/Nogo task while electroencephalographic activity was recorded and completed questionnaires before and after a MBI or an active control program. Improvements in EFs assessed by questionnaires together with an increased Nogo-P3 activity associated with successful inhibition in children who received the MBI were found. The results could contribute to understand how mindfulness practice can promote the development of inhibitory control in children from vulnerable populations.",

        "title": "Evaluating the efficacy of common humanity-enhanced exposure for socially anxious young adults.",
        "abstract": "Despite some evidence of the benefits of self-compassion training among socially anxious individuals, little is known about whether enhancing self-compassion prior to exposure therapy increases initial exposure engagement. Additionally, manipulations have relied on broad definitions of self-compassion, rendering it difficult to distinguish the impact of individual components. This study employed three experiential exercises designed to enhance one facet of self-compassion-common humanity. Socially anxious undergraduates (N = 63) were randomized in groups to 1) common humanity-enhanced exposure (n = 32) or 2) exposure alone (n = 31). In the common humanity condition, participants wrote self-compassionately, shared fears, and completed a common humanity-focused lovingkindness meditation. All participants then completed a speech exposure in front of live judges followed by an optional second exposure. Within the common humanity condition, positive self-responding to the speech exposure increased (b = 0.30, p = .026). Common humanity participants also remained in the first exposure longer, relative to exposure alone (b = -30.92, p = .002). Participants rated exercises as at least moderately helpful, with sharing fears rated most helpful. In sum, a brief group-based multi-modal common humanity induction represents a promising approach to improving initial engagement with feared contexts among socially anxious individuals.",

        "abstract": "The present study explored the effects of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention known as flow meditation (Meditacion-Fluir) in the improvement of healthy life behaviors. A sample of university students (n = 51) in Spain were randomly assigned to a seven-week mindfulness treatment or a waiting list control group. Results showed that compared to the control group, individuals in the mindfulness group demonstrated significant improvements across all outcome measures including healthy eating habits (balanced diet, intake rate, snacking between meals, decrease in consumption by negative emotional states, increased consumption by negative emotional states, amount of consumption, meal times, consumption of low-fat products), tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption, and resting habits. There were differences between males and females in some of these variables and a better effect of the treatment was evident in the females of the experimental group when compared to the males. The flow meditation program shows promise for fostering a healthy lifestyle, thus decreasing behaviors related to maladaptive eating, tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption as well as negative rest habits in university students. This mindfulness program could significantly contribute to the treatment of eating disorders and addictions, wherein negative emotional states and impulsivity are central features of the condition.",

        "title": "Randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction versus aerobic exercise: effects on the self-referential brain network in social anxiety disorder.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by distorted self-views. The goal of this study was to examine whether mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) alters behavioral and brain measures of negative and positive self-views. METHODS: Fifty-six adult patients with generalized SAD were randomly assigned to MBSR or a comparison aerobic exercise (AE) program. A self-referential encoding task was administered at baseline and post-intervention to examine changes in behavioral and neural responses in the self-referential brain network during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were cued to decide whether positive and negative social trait adjectives were self-descriptive or in upper case font. RESULTS: Behaviorally, compared to AE, MBSR produced greater decreases in negative self-views, and equivalent increases in positive self-views. Neurally, during negative self versus case, compared to AE, MBSR led to increased brain responses in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). There were no differential changes for positive self versus case. Secondary analyses showed that changes in endorsement of negative and positive self-views were associated with decreased social anxiety symptom severity for MBSR, but not AE. Additionally, MBSR-related increases in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) activity during negative self-view versus case were associated with decreased social anxiety related disability and increased mindfulness. Analysis of neural temporal dynamics revealed MBSR-related changes in the timing of neural responses in the DMPFC and PCC for negative self-view versus case. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that MBSR attenuates maladaptive habitual self-views by facilitating automatic (i.e., uninstructed) recruitment of cognitive and attention regulation neural networks. This highlights potentially important links between self-referential and cognitive-attention regulation systems and suggests that MBSR may enhance more adaptive social self-referential processes in patients with SAD.",

        "title": "Mobile-Delivered Mindfulness Intervention on Anxiety Level Among College Athletes: Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: College athletes are a group often affected by anxiety. Few interventional studies have been conducted to address the anxiety issues in this population. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a mobile-delivered mindfulness intervention among college athletes to study its feasibility and efficacy in lowering their anxiety level and improving their mindfulness (measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ]). METHODS: In April 2019, we recruited 290 college athletes from a public university in Shanghai, China, and 288 of them were randomized into an intervention group and a control group (closed trial), with the former (n=150) receiving a therapist-guided, smartphone-delivered mindfulness-based intervention and the latter receiving mental health promotion messages (n=138). We offered in-person instructions during the orientation session for the intervention group in a classroom, with the therapist interacting with the participants on the smartphone platform later during the intervention. We used generalized linear modeling and the intent-to-treat approach to compare the 2 groups' outcomes in dispositional anxiety, precompetition anxiety, and anxiety during competition, plus the 5 dimensions of mindfulness (measured by the FFMQ). RESULTS: Our intent-to-treat analysis and generalized linear modeling found no significant difference in dispositional anxiety, precompetition anxiety, or anxiety during competition. Only the \"observation\" facet of mindfulness measures had a notable difference between the changes experienced by the 2 groups, whereby the intervention group had a net gain of .214 yet fell short of reaching statistical significance (P=.09). Participants who specialized in group sports had a higher level of anxiety (beta=.19; SE=.08), a lower level of \"nonjudgemental inner experience\" in FFMQ (beta=-.07; SE=.03), and a lower level of \"nonreactivity\" (beta=-.138; SE=.052) than those specializing in individual sports. CONCLUSIONS: No significant reduction in anxiety was detected in this study. Based on the participant feedback, the time availability for mindfulness practice and session attendance for these student athletes in an elite college could have compromised the intervention's effectiveness. Future interventions among this population could explore a more student-friendly time schedule (eg, avoid final exam time) or attempt to improve cognitive and scholastic outcomes.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sub-threshold depression (SD) has been associated with impairments in adolescent health which increase the rate of major depression. Researchers have shown the effectiveness of mindfulness on mental health, however whether the traditional mindful skills were suitable for youngsters, it was not clear. This study investigated the effects of a tailed Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on their psychological state. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out. 56 participants who met the inclusion criteria agreed to be arranged randomly to either the MBSR group (n=28) or the control group (n=28). Participants in MBSR group received a tailored 8-week, one time per week, one hour each time group intervention. The effectiveness of intervention was measured using validated scales, which including BDI-II, MAAS, RRS at three times (T1-before intervention; T2-after intervention; T3-three months after intervention). A repeated-measures analysis of variance model was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results showed significant improvements in MBSR group comparing with control group that depression level decreased after the 8-week intervention and the follow up (F =17.721, p < 0.00). At the same time, RRS score was significantly decreased at T2 and T3(F= 28.277, p < 0.00). The results also showed that MBSR promoted the level of mindfulness and the effect persisted for three months after intervention (F=13.489, p < 0.00). CONCLUSION: A tailored MBSR intervention has positive effects on psychology health among SD youngsters, including decrease depression and rumination level, cultivate mindfulness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To mitigate the psychological burdens of COVID-19 for frontline clinicians (FCs), we adapted an existing evidence-based resiliency program, Stress Management and Resilience Training Relaxation Response Program (SMART-3RP), for FCs. This analysis explores moderators of stress coping to determine which subgroups of FCs benefited most from SMART-3RP. METHODS: 102 FCs from Mass General Brigham hospitals engaged in the adapted SMART-3RP. Assessments were completed at group entry (Week 0) and completion (Week 4). The primary outcome was stress coping, and we examined 15 possible baseline moderators. We fit linear mixed effects regression models and assessed potential baseline moderators using a likelihood ratio test. We report model-based estimates and confidence intervals for each moderator-by-time interaction (i.e., differential effect), where positive/negative values indicate more/less improvement in average perceived stress coping. RESULTS: Stress coping improved from Week 0 to Week 4 (mean improvement [95% CI] = 0.9 [0.6 to 1.2]). FCs with higher anxiety (differential effect [95% CI] = 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4]), depression (0.4 [0.2 to 0.6]), and loneliness (0.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), but lower levels of mindfulness (CAMS-R(focus): 1.0 [0.4 to 1.6]; CAMS-R(accept): 1.3 [0.7 to 2.0]) and self-compassion (0.4, [0.1 to 0.8]) at baseline experienced greater benefits in perceived stress coping from the SMART-3RP. Baseline health uncertainty along with sociodemographic and work characteristics did not moderate stress coping. DISCUSSION: Results highlight particular sub-populations of FCs that may benefit more from a stress management intervention, especially during emergency responses (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).",

        "abstract": "Mindful eating may be an effective intervention for increasing awareness of hunger and satiety cues, improving eating regulation and dietary patterns, reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and promoting weight loss. Diabetes self-management education (DSME), which addresses knowledge, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations for improving food choices, also may be an effective intervention for diabetes self-care. Yet few studies have compared the impact of mindful eating to a DSME-based treatment approach on patient outcomes.

        "title": "Neurobiological Aspects of Mindfulness in Pain Autoregulation: Unexpected Results from a Randomized-Controlled Trial and Possible Implications for Meditation Research.",
        "abstract": "Background: Research has demonstrated that short meditation training may yield higher pain tolerance in acute experimental pain. Our study aimed at examining underlying mechanisms of this alleged effect. In addition, placebo research has shown that higher pain tolerance is mediated via endogenous neuromodulators: experimental inhibition of opioid receptors by naloxone antagonized this effect. We performed a trial to discern possible placebo from meditation-specific effects on pain tolerance and attention. Objectives: It was proposed that (i) meditation training will increase pain tolerance; (ii) naloxone will inhibit this effect; (iii) increased pain tolerance will correlate with improved attention performance and mindfulness. Methods: Randomized-controlled, partly blinded trial with 31 healthy meditation-naive adults. Pain tolerance was assessed by the tourniquet test, attention performance was measured by Attention Network Test (ANT), self-perceived mindfulness by Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory. 16 participants received a 5-day meditation training, focusing on body/breath awareness; the control group (N = 15) received no intervention. Measures were taken before the intervention and on 3 consecutive days after the training, with all participants receiving either no infusion, naloxone infusion, or saline infusion (blinded). Blood samples were taken in order to determine serum morphine and morphine glucuronide levels by applying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Results: The meditation group produced fewer errors in ANT. Paradoxically, increases in pain tolerance occurred in both groups (accentuated in control), and correlated with reported mindfulness. Naloxone showed a trend to decrease pain tolerance in both groups. Plasma analyses revealed sporadic morphine and/or morphine metabolite findings with no discernable pattern. Discussion: Main objectives could not be verified. Since underlying study goals had not been made explicit to participants, on purpose (framing effects toward a hypothesized mindfulness-pain tolerance correlation were thus avoided, trainees had not been instructed how to 'use' mindfulness, regarding pain), the question remains open whether lack of meditation effects on pain tolerance was due to these intended 'non-placebo' conditions, cultural effects, or other confounders, or on an unsuitable paradigm. Conclusion: Higher pain tolerance through meditation could not be confirmed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a viable alternative to maintenance antidepressant medication (M-ADM) to reduce risk of relapse/recurrence (RR) in recurrent depression, but its mechanism of action is not yet fully articulated. This secondary analysis of the PREVENT trial examined if MBCT with support to taper medication (MBCT-TS) reduces risk of RR in part by enhancing positive affect (PA). METHOD: In a single-blind, parallel, group randomized controlled trial, adults with \u22653 prior depressive episodes, but not currently in episode and who were taking M-ADM, were randomized to receive either MBCT-TS or ongoing maintenance M-ADM. The primary outcome was RR over 24-month follow-up. Levels of positive affect were assessed at intake and posttreatment. The original PREVENT trial was preregistered (ISRCTN 26666654), but this secondary analysis was not. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-four individuals (predominantly female and of White British ethnicity) were recruited, with 212 randomized to each arm. MBCT-TS led to significantly greater PA relative to M-ADM at posttreatment assessment (\u0394 = 2.78, 95% CI [1.47, 4.08], p < .001). RR was experienced during follow-up by 194 individuals (100 M-ADM; 94 MBCT-TS). Greater intake PA predicted a reduced hazard of RR across treatments (p < .001; hazard ratio = .96, 95% CI [0.94, 0.98]). In individuals who had not relapsed by posttreatment with complete data (121 M-ADM; 145 MBCT-TS), greater increase in PA from intake to posttreatment mediated reduced risk of subsequent RR (p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that greater levels of PA predict reduced risk of RR and that MBCT-TS in part acts to protect from RR when withdrawing from M-ADM by increasing PA.

        "abstract": "Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant issue in the United States, characterized by chronic relapse following periods of abstinence. One of the primary precursors to relapse is craving. Findings from several studies have shown a negative association between trait mindfulness and craving in clinical samples; however, further research is needed to understand mechanisms underlying this relationship. Purpose/Objectives: The current study assessed thought suppression as a partial mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness and craving. Methods: The current study used data from a previous randomized controlled trial of adults (N = 244) enrolled in community-based treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). Results: Analyses showed a significant moderate positive association between thought suppression and craving, a significant moderate negative association between thought suppression and trait mindfulness, and a significant moderate negative association between trait mindfulness and craving. Subsequent analyses confirmed a partial mediating role of thought suppression in the relationship between trait mindfulness and craving, indicating the inverse relationship between trait mindfulness and craving was partially explained by thought suppression. Conclusions/importance: These findings may inform treatment for SUD. Specifically, targeting thought suppression through mindfulness-based treatment approaches may be a mechanism through which craving can be reduced.",

        "abstract": "Contemplative practice has demonstrated benefits for mental health and well-being. Most previous studies, however, implemented in-person trainings containing a mix of different, mostly solitary, practices and focused on pre- to post-training outcomes. In this randomized trial, we explore the immediate differential efficacy of two daily app-delivered practices in shifting emotional (valence, arousal) and thinking patterns (thought content on future-past, self-other, positive-negative dimensions). For 10 weeks of daily training, 212 participants (18-65 years) performed either a novel 12-min partner-based socio-emotional practice (Affect Dyad) or a 12-min attention-focused solitary mindfulness-based practice. Using ordinal Bayesian multilevel modeling, we found that both practice types led to more positive affect and higher arousal. However, whereas mindfulness-based practice partly led to a decrease in active thoughts, particularly in future-, other-related and negative thoughts, the Dyad in contrast led to increases in other-related, and positive thoughts. This shift towards more social and positive thoughts may specifically support overcoming ruminative thinking patterns associated with self-related and negative thought content. Overall, these differential findings may help inform the adaptation of scalable app-based mental trainings in different segments of the population with the goal to improve mental health and well-being.",

METHODS: In a randomized-controlled design, outpatients with SSD (N = 48) were assigned to either MBGT in addition to German university-level treatment as usual (MBGT+TAU; n = 25) or TAU (n = 23). At baseline and at four-week post-intervention, clinical parameters and OXT levels were determined. RESULTS: Results indicate high feasibility and acceptance with a 95.7% adherence- and 94% retention- rate of MBGT in SSD. While no significant changes in empathy were observed, MBGT+TAU demonstrated a significant reduction in positive symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrom Scale) compared to TAU at post-intervention. OXT levels were significantly increased in MBGT+TAU at post-intervention, suggesting a potential link between mindfulness and the oxytocinergic system in SSD. Additionally, improvements in various clinical parameters were indicated. CONCLUSION: The study contributes to the growing evidence supporting feasibility, acceptability, and positive effects of MBGT in outpatients with SSD, emphasizing the need for further research to solidify these findings.

Online delivery of mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) has not previously been evaluated. This study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a digital MBTI program for improving insomnia symptoms. It was hypothesized that a 6-week digital MBTI program would reduce insomnia symptoms and pre-sleep arousal and improve mood, compared to a waitlist control condition. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants (M = 29.44, SD = 11.97 years) experiencing insomnia symptoms (insomnia severity index [ISI] \u2265 8) were randomized to either a 6-week intervention or waitlist condition. Participants completed the ISI, pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and the positive and negative affect schedule at baseline, mid-, and post-study. Feasibility was assessed across four domains (acceptability, implementation, practicality, and preliminary efficacy) using self-reports, attrition, program completions, and module completions. RESULTS: Feasibility data for the intervention indicated that there was 22% attrition, and 79% of the modules were completed. There were significantly greater reductions in the severity of insomnia symptoms (p < .001) and both cognitive (p = .03) and somatic (p = .02) subscales of the PSAS, at post-intervention compared to the waitlist group. There were no significant group differences in mood.

DESIGN: A single centre, randomised, wait-list, pilot study. SETTING: A high security prison in New Zealand. SUBJECTS: Fifty-five adult male participants who had experienced at least one traumatic brain injury in their lifetime (mean age 37.29 +/-9.81 years). INTERVENTION: A manualised ten session, in-person, group based combined Cognitive Behavioural Therapy /Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction intervention versus wait list control. MAIN MEASURES: The Negative Affect Repair Questionnaire and Rivermead Post-concussion Symptom Questionnaire were completed at baseline, post-intervention (five weeks) and at 12 week follow up. In-prison misconduct charges and negative file notes were reviewed for the previous five weeks at each assessment time point. RESULTS: There was an improvement in the use of calming and distraction strategies in the intervention group from baseline (x = 17.38, SD = 3.57) to post-intervention (x = 18.67, SD = 3.84) and 12-week follow up (x = 18.13, SD = 2.63).

We also sought to understand the factors that may influence the effectiveness of VR interventions and user experience. METHOD: Seventy-six randomly recruited participants were divided into a control group and an experimental group of 38 participants, each according to a random number table, and were trained in VR meditation for eight weeks. The experimental group used a PHRI-based mindfulness program, while the control group used a traditional mindfulness meditation program. We used The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the PAD emotional three-dimensional scale to assess the level of state mindfulness and changes in the emotional state before and at the end of the experiment. The Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire measured the user's sense of presence and immersion in the virtual environment. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaires and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used at the baseline assessment stage before and at the 4-week follow-up after the experiment to assess the change in trait mindfulness levels due to the mindfulness training. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaires and the DASS-21 were used to assess changes in mindfulness and mental health trait levels. RESULTS: At the end of the experiment, the MMSQ score was significantly lower in the control group than in the experimental group, while the ITQ score was significantly higher than in the experimental group, and both scores were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the follow-up assessment four weeks after the end of the experiment, the FFMQ-15 score and the DASS-21 were significantly and statistically higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Since the scores of the PAD scale did not obey a normal distribution, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the results, which proved that the experimental group had higher levels of emotional activation and arousal. CONCLUSION: The VR positive thinking program developed based on PHRI can significantly increase the positive thinking state and emotional arousal and activation of the general population participants but does not directly lead to the growth of positive emotions. Moreover, this detached psychedelic scene brings users a weaker sense of presence and presence than traditional natural space scenes. Furthermore, it does not bring any intense simulator motion sickness symptoms. These findings suggest that VR programs developed based on PHRI have a more positive facilitation effect on the positive state and that this increase lasts longer than conventional VR-positive programs.",

        "title": "Hippocampal circuits underlie improvements in self-reported anxiety following mindfulness training.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness meditation has successfully been applied to cultivate skills in self-regulation of emotion, as it employs the unbiased present moment awareness of experience. This heightened attention to and awareness of sensory experience has been postulated to create an optimal therapeutic exposure condition and thereby improve extinction learning. We recently demonstrated increased connectivity in hippocampal circuits during the contextual retrieval of extinction memory following mindfulness training. METHODS: Here, we examine the role of structural changes in hippocampal subfields following mindfulness training in a randomized controlled longitudinal study using a two-day fear-conditioning and extinction protocol. RESULTS: We demonstrate an association between mindfulness training-related increases in subiculum and decreased hippocampal connectivity to lateral occipital regions during contextual retrieval of extinguished fear. Further, we demonstrate an association between decreased connectivity and decreases in self-reported anxiety following mindfulness training. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of the subiculum in gating interactions with contextual stimuli during memory retrieval and, also, the mechanisms through which mindfulness training may foster resilience.",

        "title": "Healthy Learning Mind - a school-based mindfulness and relaxation program: a study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has shown positive effects on mental health, mental capacity and well-being among adult population. Among children and adolescents, previous research on the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions on health and well-being has shown promising results, but studies with methodologically sound designs have been called for. Few intervention studies in this population have compared the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to alternative intervention programs with adequate sample sizes. METHODS/DESIGN: Our primary aim is to explore the effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness intervention program compared to a standard relaxation program among a non-clinical children and adolescent sample, and a non-treatment control group in school context. In this study, we systematically examine the effects of mindfulness intervention on mental well-being (primary outcomes being resilience; existence/absence of depressive symptoms; experienced psychological strengths and difficulties), cognitive functions, psychophysiological responses, academic achievements, and motivational determinants of practicing mindfulness. The design is a cluster randomized controlled trial with three arms (mindfulness intervention group, active control group, non-treatment group) and the sample includes 59 Finnish schools and approx. 3 000 students aged 12-15 years. Intervention consists of nine mindfulness based lessons, 45 mins per week, for 9 weeks, the dose being identical in active control group receiving standard relaxation program called Relax. The programs are delivered by 14 educated facilitators. Students, their teachers and parents will fill-in the research questionnaires before and after the intervention, and they will all be followed up 6 months after baseline. Additionally, students will be followed 12 months after baseline. For longer follow-up, consent to linking the data to the main health registers has been asked from students and their parents. DISCUSSION: The present study examines systematically the effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness program compared to a standard relaxation program, and a non-treatment control group. A strength of the current study lies in its methodologically rigorous, randomized controlled study design, which allows novel evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness over and above a standard relaxation program.

        "abstract": "ObjectivePreliminary findings suggest that different kinds of meditation could work on diverse cognitive and psychological processes. The present study aimed at disentangling the effects of three mindfulness techniques on mental rumination and subjective time perspective. Design: 75 young healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: mindful breathing, body scan, observing-thoughts meditation and an active control condition. The meditation groups practiced mindfulness daily and attended weekly group meetings for 8 weeks, while the control group was involved in reading and discussing a book about mindfulness. Main outcome measures: Self-report measures of mindfulness skills, ruminative thinking, attitude towards time, anxiety, depression and personality traits. Results: In all meditation conditions, analysis of covariance showed a significant improvement in mindfulness skills compared to the control group. We found a specific effect of mindful breathing in reducing participants' tendency to brooding and in increasing their positive vision of the future, compared to all other conditions. Conclusions: As expected, we found some differential effects: breathing meditation helped practitioners to train more effectively their ability to disengage from maladaptive ruminative thoughts, which could be reflected in a more optimistic attitude toward the future. These results provide useful information to structure better mindfulness-based interventions.",

        "abstract": "The authors hypothesized that a social and emotional learning (SEL) program involving mindfulness and caring for others, designed for elementary school students, would enhance cognitive control, reduce stress, promote well-being and prosociality, and produce positive school outcomes. To test this hypothesis, 4 classes of combined 4th and 5th graders (N = 99) were randomly assigned to receive the SEL with mindfulness program versus a regular social responsibility program. Measures assessed executive functions (EFs), stress physiology via salivary cortisol, well-being (self-reports), prosociality and peer acceptance (peer reports), and math grades. Relative to children in the social responsibility program, children who received the SEL program with mindfulness (a) improved more in their cognitive control and stress physiology; (b) reported greater empathy, perspective-taking, emotional control, optimism, school self-concept, and mindfulness, (c) showed greater decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and peer-rated aggression, (d) were rated by peers as more prosocial, and (e) increased in peer acceptance (or sociometric popularity). The results of this investigation suggest the promise of this SEL intervention and address a lacuna in the scientific literature-identifying strategies not only to ameliorate children's problems but also to cultivate their well-being and thriving.

        "abstract": "Breathing practices are often incorporated into treatments for tobacco dependence, but there is little direct research testing the efficacy of breathing practices. This study examined the effects of a mindfulness-based yogic breathing (MB) intervention versus active treatment (cognitive strategy [CS]) and no-treatment (NT) control groups on craving, affect, withdrawal, and smoking behavior. Smokers (N = 60; 50% female; 83% African American) were randomized to receive 20 min of MB, CS, or NT. Participants completed self-report measures before and after the manipulation and then took part in a 50-min smoking choice procedure. Afterward, participants were advised to use the techniques they learned and self-monitor smoking for 24 hr. They received 3 reminder text messages and returned to the lab the following day. MB and CS were more effective than NT in decreasing craving to smoke and perceived nicotine withdrawal. MB, but not CS, was more effective than NT in reducing negative affect. MB reduced the risk of smoking by more than twofold relative to both CS and NT during the smoking choice procedure. Participants in the MB condition smoked fewer cigarettes than those in the CS and NT conditions in the 24 hr following the manipulation. There were no differential effects of the manipulations on state mindfulness or positive affect. Mindful yogic breathing appears to be particularly effective in alleviating the acute negative effects of smoking abstinence and decreasing smoking behavior. Mindful breathing techniques are safe, simple, and cost-effective strategies that deserve additional research attention, especially among underserved populations of smokers.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women with endometriosis suffer from frequent symptoms despite multiple treatments in tertiary care. Although there is a need for a biopsychosocial perspective on endometriosis treatment, few conservative treatments have been investigated. We aimed to investigate the effects of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention (bMBI) in women with deep endometriosis who remain symptomatic despite undergoing conventional medical treatment. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed with two groups: a standard medical treatment plus bMBI program and only standard medical treatment as a control. A total of 63 eligible participants were randomized to bMBI and control groups. The primary outcome was endometriosis-related pain, and secondary outcomes were quality of life and stress perception post-treatment. Analyses were carried out using multiple regression models. RESULTS: The results show that bMBI significantly improved pain unpleasantness (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.67, NNT = 3.2), pelvic pain (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.16, NNT = 5.3) and dyschezia (Cohen's f(2) = 0.23, NNT = 2.9) immediately post-treatment and decreased all endometriosis-related pain (Cohen's f(2) ranging from 0.20 to 0.60 and NNT ranging from 5 to -9) after the follow-up. We found an extensive positive effect of bMBI on the mental health dimension in the two time point measures (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.34 and 0.25, NNT = 3.5 and 2.3) and vitality (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.22, NNT = 2.1) after the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that bMBI is useful for managing endometriosis-related pain and restoring women's psychological well-being. SIGNIFICANCE: Brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention (bMBI) improved endometriosis-related pain and mental health compared to standard medical care. The present findings contribute to the applicability of MBI in visceral pain patients.",

        "abstract": "Those with high baseline stress levels are more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While meditation may reduce stress and alter the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN), little is known about its impact in these populations. Our objective was to conduct a \"proof of concept\" trial to determine whether Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) would improve DMN connectivity and reduce hippocampal atrophy among adults with MCI. 14 adults with MCI were randomized to MBSR vs. usual care and underwent resting state fMRI at baseline and follow-up. Seed based functional connectivity was applied using posterior cingulate cortex as seed. Brain morphometry analyses were performed using FreeSurfer. The results showed that after the intervention, MBSR participants had increased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus compared to controls. In addition, MBSR participants had trends of less bilateral hippocampal volume atrophy than control participants. These preliminary results indicate that in adults with MCI, MBSR may have a positive impact on the regions of the brain most related to MCI and AD. Further research with larger sample sizes and longer-follow-up are needed to further investigate the results from this pilot study.",

The use of mindfulness-based interventions to reduce stress has shown promising results; however, the time commitment of typical programs can be a barrier to successful implementation in health care settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and feasibility of a brief mindfulness-based program to reduce stress during work hours among health care professionals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial was conducted among full-time health care professionals at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, between September 2017 and May 2018. Participants were randomized to receive mindfulness-based self-care (MBSC) training or life-as-usual control. Data were analyzed from June 2018 to January 2020. INTERVENTIONS: The MBSC intervention included 5 weekly, 1.5-hour in-class mindfulness practice sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stress level was the primary outcome, assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item version. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, burnout, positive and negative affect, mindfulness (trait and state), and self-care. Assessments were taken at baseline and at the end of the intervention (week 5) in the intervention and control groups, and at follow-up (week 13) in the intervention group to test for a maintenance effect. A postprogram evaluation was also obtained. RESULTS: Of 82 randomized participants, 78 who completed the study at week 5 were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 32 [23-48] years; 65 [83%] women), including 43 participants in the MBSC group and 35 participants in the control group. At the end of the intervention, compared with the control group, the MBSC group had reduced levels of stress (mean [SD] score, 17.29 [5.84] vs 18.54 [6.30]; P = .02) and anxiety (mean [SD] score, 2.58 [1.52] vs 4.23 [1.73]; P < .001), and improved positive affect (mean [SD] score, 35.69 [7.12] vs 31.42 [7.27]; P < .001), state mindfulness (mean [SD] score, 3.74 [1.18] vs 2.78 [1.16]; P < .001), and mindful self-care (mean [SD] score, 7.29 [2.44] vs 5.54 [2.77]; P < .001). Burnout, negative affect, and trait mindfulness levels did not differ between groups. Changes within the MBSC group through follow-up included sustained reductions in stress (change, -6.14; 95% CI, -7.84 to -4.44; P < .001), anxiety (change, -1.46; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.94; P < .001), trait mindfulness (change, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.90; P < .001), and state mindfulness (change, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that this brief mindfulness-based intervention was an effective and feasible means to reduce stress in health care professionals.

There is an extensive body of neuroscience research showing that contemplative practices, such as mindfulness, produce measurable effects on brain function and overall well-being. We hypothesized that a mindfulness-based training program designed for engineering graduate students would improve emotional well-being and, secondarily, enhance research capacity. An initial pilot study was conducted at a single institution (Phase 1), followed by a larger study conducted at both the original and a second institution (Phase 2) to gather additional data and show the program's transferability. The program comprised eight weekly mindfulness training sessions. Individuals in the study were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or wait-list control group. We administered pre- and post-test surveys with quantitative measures designed to assess emotional and physical well-being, as well as creativity, research satisfaction, and desire to contribute to the betterment of society. Participants also completed a summative survey to evaluate the impact of the program on their well-being and research. Analysis revealed statistically significant findings: improved emotional health, decreased neuroticism, increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and increased mindfulness in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. Intervention groups in Phase 2 also reported statistically significant improvement in satisfaction with their research. Our findings suggest that mindfulness training has the potential to play a vital professional and personal development role in graduate engineering education.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Behavioral evidence suggests that parenting-focused mindfulness interventions can improve parenting practices and enhance family wellbeing, potentially operating through altered emotional processing in parents. However, the mechanisms through which parent mindfulness interventions achieve their positive benefits have not yet been empirically tested, knowledge which is key to refine and maximize intervention effects. Thus, as part of a randomized controlled trial, the present study examined the affective mechanisms of an 8-week parenting-focused mindfulness intervention, the Parenting Mindfully (PM) intervention, versus a minimal-intervention parent education control. METHODS: Twenty highly stressed mothers of adolescents completed pre- and post-intervention behavioral and fMRI sessions, in which mothers completed a parent-adolescent conflict interaction, fMRI emotion task, and fMRI resting state scan. Mothers reported on their mindful parenting, and maternal emotional reactivity to the parent-adolescent conflict task was assessed via observed emotion expression, self-reported negative emotion, and salivary cortisol reactivity. RESULTS: Results indicated that the PM intervention increased brain responsivity in left posterior insula in response to negative affective stimuli, and altered resting state functional connectivity in regions involved in self-reference, behavioral regulation, and social-emotional processing. Changes in mothers' brain function and connectivity were associated with increased mindful parenting and decreased emotional reactivity to the parent-adolescent conflict task. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that mindfulness-based changes in maternal emotional awareness at the neurobiological level are associated with decreased emotional reactivity in parenting interactions, illuminating potential neurobiological targets for future parent-focused intervention.",

        "title": "Attentional and affective consequences of technology supported mindfulness training: a randomised, active control, efficacy trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training (MT) programs represent an approach to attention training with well-validated mental health benefits. However, research supporting MT efficacy is based predominantly on weekly-meeting, facilitator-led, group-intervention formats. It is unknown whether participants might benefit from neurofeedback-assisted, technology-supported MT (N-tsMT), in which meditation is delivered individually, without the need for a facilitator, travel to a training site, or the presence of a supportive group environment. Mirroring the validation of group MT interventions, the first step in addressing this question requires identifying whether N-tsMT promotes measurable benefits. Here, we report on an initial investigation of a commercial N-tsMT system. METHODS: In a randomized, active control trial, community-dwelling healthy adult participants carried out 6 weeks of daily practice, receiving either N-tsMT (n = 13), or a control condition of daily online math training (n = 13). Training effects were assessed on target measures of attention and well-being. Participants also completed daily post-training surveys assessing effects on mood, body awareness, calm, effort, and stress. RESULTS: Analysis revealed training effects specific to N-tsMT, with attentional improvements in overall reaction time on a Stroop task, and well-being improvements via reduced somatic symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory. Attention and well-being improvements were correlated, and effects were greatest for the most neurotic participants. However, secondary, exploratory measures of attention and well-being did not show training-specific effects. N-tsMT was associated with greater body awareness and calm, and initially greater effort that later converged with effort in the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings indicate that N-tsMT promotes modest benefits for attention and subjective well-being in a healthy community sample relative to an active control condition. However, the findings would benefit from replication in a larger sample, and more intensive practice or more comprehensive MT instruction might be required to promote the broader benefits typically reported in group format, facilitated MT.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interoceptive dysfunction is emerging as an important biomarker for mental illnesses, such as depression which is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Little empirical research explains the relationship between interoception and depression. METHODS: Using multivariable linear regression models and cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized control trial of primary care patients (N = 281), we analyzed the relationship between depression severity (none/slight, mild, and moderate/severe via the PROMIS depression scale) and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) subscales (noticing, not distracting, not worrying, attention regulation, emotional awareness, selfregulation, body listening and trusting). RESULTS: Adjusted results suggest moderate/severe depression was inversely associated with body trusting (p < .001), body listening (p < .01), noticing (p < .01), emotional awareness (p < .01), and self-regulation (p < .05). Mild depression was inversely associated with body trusting (p <.01). After correction for multiple comparisons, the relationship between MAIA body trusting and mild and moderate/severe depression remained significant. LIMITATIONS: Our findings may not be generalizable to other populations or healthcare settings. Additionally, findings cannot be interpreted as causal due to our inability to establish temporality. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of body trust appears important for understanding how individuals with depression interpret or respond to interoceptive stimuli and may represent the leading edge of interoceptive dysregulation seen in depressive disorders. Our findings support a hypothesis about mechanisms of action underlying hypoactivation in depression. Further, these results support clinical identification of subtypes of depression, such as those with high levels of co-occurring anxiety.",

        "abstract": "Studies have consistently shown that family caregivers experience caregiver burden and depression when they provide care for family members with psychosis. Photovoice is a participatory action research method of fostering dialogues about personal experiences by sharing and discussing photographs that may improve our understanding about how a mindfulness-based family psychoeducation program (MBFPE) can reduce the caregiver burden and improve their caregiving experience. We explored the experiences of the participants in their use of photovoice in a MBFPE. We investigated whether the MBFPE program generated positive changes for caregivers of young adults with psychosis. Using photovoice, we collected qualitative data to help develop a unique contextual understanding of MBFPE program outcomes and generate novel ideas, insights, suggestions, and questions on the basis of participant's perceptions. Participants in our pilot study and randomized controlled study of MBFPE were invited to participate in this photovoice activity. On the basis of a procedure developed for MBFPE, caregivers were invited to use photographs to express how mindfulness contributed to caregivers' management of their caregiving stress and burden. Caregiver's inquiry with the MBFPE instructors were transcribed for analysis together with the photographs. A grounded theory approach was adopted to analyze the photovoice images, participants' reflections, and inquiries of photographs. Six themes were developed in understanding the lived experience of caregivers in participation of MBFPE: (1) I pay attention to the present moment; (2) I care about my family; (3) I trust my children; (4) I appreciate the connection with and support from nature and the universe; (5) I observe my worries and guilt and learn not to be reactive; and (6) I find space in offering care and exercising self-care. The application of photovoice can offer an additional approach to enhance the awareness and insights of participants in a mindfulness-based program. Specific guidelines may be developed to enhance the learning of participants.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions have previously been shown to have positive effects on psychological well-being. However, the time commitment, teacher shortage, and high cost of classic mindfulness interventions may have hindered efforts to spread the associated benefits to individuals in developing countries. Brief mindfulness meditation (BMM) has recently received attention as a way to disseminate the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions. Most existing BMM methods are adaptations of the classic approach. Few studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of BMM. We developed a 15-min BMM named JW2016, which is based on the core concepts of mindfulness, Anapanasati (breath meditation of Buddhist Vipassana), our practical experience, and the results of scientific reports on meditation. We investigated the effects of this BMM on mood and emotion processing in an effort to create an effective, convenient, safe, and standardized BMM method that could benefit individuals with limited time or money to devote to meditation. Forty-six healthy participants (aged 18-25 years) were randomly allocated to the BMM group (n = 23) or the emotional regulation education (ERE) control group (n = 23). Forty-two of the study participants cooperated fully in all measurements and interventions (one time daily for seven consecutive days). Mood was measured with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) and the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI). Emotion processing was evaluated by assessing performance on an emotion intensity task, an emotional memory task, and an emotional dot-probe task. After intervention, the BMM group, but not the ERE group, showed a significant decreases in emotional intensity in response to positive as well as negative emotional stimuli, response time for emotional memory, and duration of attention bias toward negative emotional stimuli. Negative effects on mood state were found in the ERE group but not in the BMM group. This study demonstrated that BMM may improve aspects of emotion processing such as emotion intensity, emotional memory, and emotional attention bias. JW2016 BMM may be an effective, convenient, safe and standardized way to help practitioners remain focused and peaceful without any negative effect on emotion.",

Mindfulness practice is a core component of MBIs, thought to elicit and maintain positive behavioral change; however, no research to our knowledge has assessed the role of mindfulness practice on sustained treatment gains among women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD. Such research is necessary to better inform MBIs for dually diagnosed women. METHODS: This secondary analysis assessed whether post-intervention formal and informal mindfulness practice predicted reductions in PTSD symptoms and substance craving 6 months following an 8-session mindfulness-based relapse prevention intervention for women diagnosed with co-occurring PTSD-SUD (N = 23). Data were derived from a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a trauma-integrated mindfulness-based relapse prevention program for women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD. RESULTS: Greater duration of formal mindfulness practice (i.e., minutes per practice) predicted reduced total PTSD symptoms ([Formula: see text] = - .670, p < .00), trauma-related avoidance ([Formula: see text] = - .564, p = .01), arousal and reactivity ([Formula: see text] = - .530, p = .02), and negative cognitions and mood ([Formula: see text] = - .780, p < .01) six months following treatment. Informal practice did not predict any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights the potential role of formal mindfulness practice in sustaining reductions in PTSD symptoms over time among women with co-occurring PTSD-SUD. Further study of strategies to promote ongoing formal mindfulness practice in this population following a MBI are warranted.

        "title": "Cognitive-affective changes mediate the mindfulness-based intervention effect on endometriosis-related pain and mental health: A path analysis approach.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is poor knowledge about the therapeutic mechanisms of the conservative interventions for endometriosis. We hypothesized that the effects of a brief mindfulness-based intervention (bMBI) on pelvic pain intensity (PPI), pain unpleasantness (PU) and quality of life mental health (QoL-MH) are mediated by direct and indirect paths of changes in pain catastrophizing (PC), positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). METHODS: A secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial of women with endometriosis, assigned to standard medical treatment (n = 32) and standard medical treatment plus bMBI (n = 31). We tested a series of parallel and serial mediators (PC, PA and NA) of the relationship between bMBI and outcomes (PPI, PU and QoL-MH). RESULTS: The bMBI group demonstrated improvement in PA (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.12 [0.01, 0.36]), decreases in NA (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.06 [0.00, 0.24]) and PC (Cohen's f(2)  = 0.16 [0.02, 0.42]). The PC reduction mediated the effect of the bMBI on PPI and PU directly; however, the PC effect through PA increase mediated the PU marginally but not PPI changes. bMBI effect on Qol-MH was mediated directly by PA and NA. The PC improved Qol-MH through PA increase and Pain decrease but not via NA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that bMBI impacts pain through changes in pain-related cognitive-affective factors. bMBI can improve QoL-MH by multiple pathways, including but not limited to pain reduction, highlighting the independent potential of improvement in affect to restore mental health in endometriosis. SIGNIFICANCE: Brief mindfulness-based intervention improves endometriosis pain through pain-related cognitive-affective factors and quality of life mental health via pain and affect changes unrelated to pain.",

        "title": "A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss Intervention on Cardiovascular Reactivity to Social-Evaluative Threat Among Adults with Obesity.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions have been found to reduce psychological and physiological stress reactivity. In obesity, however, stress reactivity is complex, with studies showing both exaggerated and blunted physiological responses to stressors. A nuanced view of stress reactivity is the \"challenge and threat\" framework, which defines adaptive and maladaptive patterns of psychophysiological stress reactivity. We hypothesized that mindfulness training would facilitate increased challenge-related appraisals, emotions, and cardiovascular reactivity, including sympathetic nervous system activation paired with increased cardiac output (CO) and reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR) compared to a control group, which would exhibit an increased threat pattern of psychophysiological reactivity to repeated stressors. METHODS: Adults (N=194) with obesity were randomized to a 5.5-month mindfulness-based weight loss intervention or an active control condition with identical diet-exercise guidelines. Participants were assessed at baseline and 4.5 months later using the Trier Social Stress Task. Electrocardiogram, impedance cardiography, and blood pressure were acquired at rest and during the speech and verbal arithmetic tasks to assess pre-ejection period (PEP), CO, and TPR reactivity. RESULTS: Mindfulness participants showed significantly greater maintenance of challenge-related emotions and cardiovascular reactivity patterns (higher CO and lower TPR) from pre to post-intervention compared to control participants, but groups did not differ in PEP. Findings were independent of changes in body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness training may increase the ability to maintain a positive outlook and mount adaptive cardiovascular responses to repeated stressors among persons with obesity though findings need to be replicated in other populations and using other forms of mindfulness interventions.",

        "abstract": "Family psychoeducation (FPE) has been recommended as a major component in the treatment of psychosis. Many previous studies have implemented an intensive program design that often only emphasized improvements in patients' illness outcomes but the benefits for caregivers were limited. There have been calls for a time-limited but cost-effective FPE program to mitigate the looming reality of the suffering of people with psychosis and their families. A Brief Mindfulness-Based Family Psychoeducation for psychosis program is developed to reduce caregivers' burden and promote young adult's recovery. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare this intervention with an ordinary FPE intervention. Both arms will involve six sessions, with a total contact time of 12 h. 300 caregivers of young adults who have experienced first episode psychosis within last 3 years will be recruited. Program effectiveness will be assessed by comparing outcomes measuring the caregivers' burden, mental health symptoms, positive well-being, and the young adult's mental health symptoms during the study and at 9-month post-randomization. The role of expressed emotions, interpersonal mindfulness, and non-attachment in mediating these outcomes will be explored. An additional qualitative approach Photovoice is selected to explore the complex family experiences and the benefits of mindfulness from the caregivers' personal perspectives.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Increasing effectiveness and sustainability of universal school-based eating disorder prevention is needed. This study adapted two existing selective prevention programmes for universal delivery, investigating feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects when delivered by trained teachers to classes of mixed-gender adolescents. METHOD: A three-arm controlled pilot study with Year 9 students (N = 288; M(age)  = 13.61 SD(age)  = .50). Three schools in south Wales and south-west England were allocated to mindfulness-based intervention (MBI), dissonance-based intervention (DBI), or classes-as-usual (CAU) control. Self-reported eating disorder risk factors were collected at baseline, 6-week post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up. Focus groups were conducted post-intervention. RESULTS: Delivery and evaluation were feasible, allowing for flexibility in scheduling, with good retention. Student and teacher ratings indicated moderate acceptability of both interventions, with recommendations for refinement. Mixed model analyses, controlling for baseline, showed significant effects of condition across post-intervention and follow-up for body esteem (DBI > CAU; Cohen's d = .34) and positive affect (MBI > CAU, d = .58). For girls only, both MBI and DBI improved body satisfaction and internalization, and the MBI additionally resulted in improved weight and shape concerns, negative affect, and life disengagement (d's = .39-1.12), across post-intervention and follow-up. DISCUSSION: Selective eating disorder prevention programmes based on cognitive dissonance and mindfulness can be delivered universally in schools, by teachers, allowing for appropriate flexibility necessary for real world implementation. Moderate acceptability indicates areas for improving content and delivery; positive effects on key outcomes are encouraging. These findings provide support for further robust evaluation. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Existing universal eating disorder prevention is limited by small effects and reliance on highly trained facilitators. This study is the first to adapt mindfulness- and dissonance-based interventions for delivery by teachers, to adolescents of all genders in a classroom setting. Delivery was largely feasible and acceptable, and both interventions showed significant effects across key risk factors for eating disorders, with larger effect sizes than found previously. This underpins further robust evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Social distancing, home confinement, economic challenges, and COVID-19-related illness and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly affect mental health in youth. One promising approach to reduce anxiety and depression in adolescents is the neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA). The objective of this individually randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) was (1) to test the feasibility of TARA, delivered partially over Zoom, and (2) to assess changes in the emotional wellbeing in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14-18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy adolescents were randomized to the TARA intervention or to the waitlist control group in February 2020, just before the start of the pandemic. The TARA group intervention was delivered in person for the first five sessions and remotely over Zoom for the remaining seven sessions due to the pandemic. The participants' acceptability of TARA was assessed weekly using the Child Session Rating Scale (CSRS). The primary outcome was the emotional wellbeing measured using emotional symptoms subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) pre/post-TARA. We also explored weekly changes in TARA participants' wellbeing using the Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS). RESULTS: The overall session rating in TARA participants improved after the switch to Zoom (Cohen's d = 1.2, p = 0.008). The results of the two-way ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in the change of the SDQ emotional symptoms during the 12 weeks between the TARA group and waitlist-control group (timepoint * group interaction: F = 0.77, p = 0.38). The exploratory analysis using the CORS in the TARA participants showed a significant improvement in their functioning over the weeks of training. CONCLUSION: Our results support the feasibility of TARA delivered over Zoom. While our primary outcome did not provide support for the improvement of the emotional wellbeing with TARA compared to a passive control group, our exploratory analysis in the intervention group indicated an improved functioning over the weeks of TARA training. The important general positive impact of this study lies in the possibility of offering a neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention remotely to youth living in remote areas and for all youth during pandemic times.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has become increasingly popular, and positive outcomes have been reported for mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in reducing stress. These findings make room for innovative perspectives on how MBIs could be applied, for instance through mobile health (mHealth). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate whether a nonguided mindfulness mobile app can decrease perceived stress in a nonclinical Dutch population over the course of 8 weeks, with follow-up at 6 months. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed to compare an experimental group that made use of a structured 8-week mHealth mindfulness program and a control group after 8 weeks, with follow-up after 6 months. Participants were recruited via a national television program. The primary outcome measure was perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale, secondary outcomes were symptoms of burnout (measured using the visual analog scale [VAS]) and psychological symptoms (measured using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire [4DSQ] at follow-up). Outcomes were analyzed using a multilevel regression model. RESULTS: At baseline, 587 respondents were included. Results showed no postintervention differences between groups for the level of perceived stress. With regard to the secondary outcome measures, the VAS for emotional exhaustion and physical exhaustion showed significantly lower scores for the experimental group after 8 weeks (P=.04 and P=.01, respectively), but not at follow-up. There were no differences between groups for psychological symptoms measured using the 4DSQ. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support our hypothesis that using the mindfulness app would reduce stress levels. However, our findings related to diminished exhaustion at 8 weeks are encouraging and require further investigation.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Research in recent years has shown that mindfulness-based interventions can enhance teachers' mental and physical health. However, the existing studies were predominantly conducted in Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies. As a randomized controlled trial in a non-WEIRD society, the present study examined the effectiveness and mechanisms of mindfulness training for Hong Kong teachers in difficult times. METHODS: Teachers from primary and secondary schools (n = 186) were randomly assigned to mindfulness training (eight-week .b Foundations) or waitlist control condition. They completed online self-report surveys on measures of well-being, emotion management, and mindfulness in teaching at baseline, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention group reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction, positive affect, general health, along with significantly lower levels of insomnia, stress, and negative affect than the control group at post-test and two-month follow-up. The effect sizes were medium to large (\u03b7 (p) (2) = 0.06 to 0.14). More importantly, teachers' baseline well-being had a significant moderating effect on the intervention effectiveness. Those with a lower baseline in well-being benefitted more than their counterparts with a higher baseline. In addition, teachers' emotion management was found to be the mediator through which mindfulness training enhanced teachers' well-being. Such improvement in well-being also predicted higher levels of mindfulness in teaching. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness training for teachers beyond WEIRD societies. It suggests the universality and practicality of mindfulness training in enhancing teachers' well-being and reducing their distress in difficult times.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: App-based interventions provide a promising avenue for mitigating the burden on mental health services by complimenting therapist-led treatments for anxiety. However, it remains unclear how specific systems' use of app features may be associated with changes in mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety and worry). OBJECTIVE: This study was a secondary analysis of engagement data from a stage 1 randomized controlled trial testing the impact of the Unwinding Anxiety mobile app among adults with generalized anxiety disorder. The aims of this study were 2-fold: to investigate whether higher microengagement with the primary intervention feature (ie, educational modules) is associated with positive changes in mental health outcomes at 2 months (ie, anxiety, worry, interoceptive awareness, and emotional reactivity) and to investigate whether the use of adjunctive app features is also associated with changes in mental health outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the intervention group during the stage 1 trial of the Unwinding Anxiety mobile app. The total use of specific mobile app features and the use specific to each feature were calculated. We used multivariate linear models with a priori significance of \u03b1=.05 to investigate the impact of cumulative app use on anxiety, worry, interoceptive awareness, and emotional regulation at 2 months, controlling for baseline scores, age, and education level in all models. Significant relationships between system use metrics and baseline participant characteristics were assessed for differences in use groupings using between-group testing (ie, 2-tailed t tests for continuous data and chi-square analyses for categorical data). RESULTS: The sample was primarily female (25/27, 93%), and the average age was 42.9 (SD 15.6) years. Educational module completion, the central intervention component, averaged 20.2 (SD 11.4) modules out of 32 for the total sample. Multivariate models revealed that completing >75% of the program was associated with an average 22.6-point increase in interoceptive awareness (b=22.6; SE 8.32; P=.01; 95% CI 5.3-39.8) and an 11.6-point decrease in worry (b=-11.6; SE 4.12; P=.01; 95% CI -20.2 to -3.1). In addition, a single log unit change in the total number of meditations was associated with a 0.62-point reduction in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale scores (b=0.62; SE 0.27; P=.005; 95% CI -1.2 to -0.6), whereas a single log unit use of the stress meter was associated with an average of a 0.5-point increase in emotional regulation scores (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; b=0.5; SE 0.21; P=.03; 95% CI 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a clearer understanding of the impact of engagement with app features on broader engagement with the health outcomes of interest.

        "title": "Mindfulness Improves Otolaryngology Residents' Performance in a Simulated Bad-News Consultation: A Pilot Study.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Delivering bad news is a stressful moment for both patient and clinician. As poor bad-news consultation quality may lead to misunderstandings, lack of treatment adherence, acute or even post-traumatic stress in patients, training interventions to improve communication skills and stress-management are necessary. Mindfulness is a recognised stress-management strategy that has shown its efficacy in reducing stress in both health professionals and students. We then supposed that a short mindfulness meditation session performed just before a simulated breaking bad-news consultation to patients with laryngeal cancer may help ear, nose and throat (ENT) residents to master their stress and improve their management of this consultation. This study aims at showing how a short mindfulness meditation performed before a simulated bad-news consultation may improve performance in its realisation by ENT residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 53 ENT residents, randomised in 2 groups. The first group completed a 5-minute mindfulness session while the other group listened to a control track. Thereafter, every resident completed an 8-minute simulated bad-news consultation with a standardised patient. Two blinded expert assessors evaluated their performance on a 25-point grid (BNC-OSAS). Residents self-assessed their stress before and after the intervention and simulated patients rated their perception of physician's empathy. RESULTS: The performance was significantly better in the mindfulness group than in the control group (m = 19.8, sd = 3.2 and m = 17.4, sd = 3.7 respectively, F(1,45)=5.27, p = 0.026, d = 0.67), especially in the communication and knowledge subdomains. There was no significant difference in perceived stress between the 2 groups. Empathy perceived by simulated patients was positively correlated to residents' performance. CONCLUSION: A short mindfulness meditation is effective for improving ENT residents' performance in a simulated bad-news consultation. These results encourage further assessments of this method with objective measures of physiological stress. More research is required concerning the feasibility and efficacy of mindfulness before daily clinical activities such as stressing bad-news consultation.",

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of \"attachment-based compassion therapy\" (ABCT) in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM), and the role of psychological flexibility as a mediator of improvements. METHODS: A total of 42 patients with FM were randomly assigned to ABCT or relaxation (active control group). Both the intervention and control condition were combined with treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was functional status (FIQ), and the secondary outcomes were clinical severity (CGI-S), pain catastrophizing (PCS), anxiety (HADS-A), depression (HADS-D), quality of life (EQ-5D), and psychological flexibility (AAQ-II). Differences between the groups were estimated using mixed-effects models, and mediation assessments were conducted using path analyses. RESULTS: The ABCT group demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the relaxation group, including better FIQ values after treatment (B = -3.01; p = 0.003). Differences in FIQ were maintained at 3-month follow-up (B = -3.33; p = 0.001). The absolute risk reduction in ABCT compared to relaxation increased by 40.0%, with an NNT = 3 based on criteria of \u226550% FIQ reduction after treatment. Psychological flexibility had a significant mediating effect on improvements. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ABCT combined with TAU appears to be effective in the treatment of FM symptoms.

Mind-body interventions (MBIs) focused on caregiver stress are often limited in teaching approaches, difficult to practice, and costly. A social media-based MBI embedded with mindfulness meditation (MM) and self-administered acupressure (SA) may be effective for family caregivers, offer greater usability, and lead to greater adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of a social media-based MBI embedded with MM and SA on family caregivers of frail older adults and to investigate the preliminary effects of the intervention using a pilot randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A 2-arm randomized controlled trial design was adopted. Family caregivers of frail older adults (n=64) were randomized into either the intervention group (n=32), receiving 8 weeks of social media-based MM and SA, or the control group (n=32), receiving brief education on caregiving for people with frailty. The primary outcome (caregiver stress) and secondary outcomes (caregiver burden, sleep quality, and mindfulness awareness and attention) were measured using a web-based survey at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: The feasibility of the intervention was established with a high attendance rate (87.5%), high usability score (79), and low attrition rate (1.6%). The generalized estimating equation results showed that participants in the intervention group at T1 and T2 experienced a significant improvement in stress reduction (P=.02 and P=.04, respectively), sleep quality (P=.004 and P=.01, respectively), and mindful awareness and attention (P=.006 and P=.02, respectively) compared with the control group. There were no substantial improvements in caregiver burden at T1 and T2 (P=.59 and P=.47, respectively). A focus group session conducted after the intervention had 5 themes: impact on the family caregivers, difficulty in practicing the intervention, the strength of the program, the limitations of the program, and perception of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the feasibility and preliminary effects of social media-based MBI embedded with acupressure and MM on reducing stress among family caregivers of frail older people and enhancing sleep quality and mindfulness levels.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A large body of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that mindfulness-based interventions are effective for improving mental health, but research is lacking in regards to the mechanisms of change. We aimed to investigate the mediating effects of self-reported altered resting state of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on mental health, when provided as a universal intervention in a real-life context. METHODS: Autoregressive path models with three time points of measurement, and contemporaneous and constant b paths were used in an RCT. The RCT took place in all five geographical regions of Denmark and included 110 schools and 191 schoolteachers. The schools were randomized 1:1 in each geographical region to intervention or a wait-list control group. The intervention was the standardized MBSR. Data were collected at baseline and after 3 and 6  months. The outcomes were perceived stress, measured by Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), symptoms of anxiety and depression, measured by Hopkins Symptom Check List-5 (SCL-5), and well-being measured by WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5). The mediator was resting state measured by the Amsterdam Resting State Questionnaire (ARSQ). RESULTS: Statistically significant mediated effects of altered ARSQ-subscales scores for Discontinuity of Mind, Planning, and Comfort were found for the MBSR effect on all outcomes; PSS, SCL-5 and WHO-5. Furthermore, statistically significant mediated effects of altered sleepiness subscale score of the effects on PSS and SCL-5 of MBSR were found. No statistically significant mediating effects of the subscales Theory of Mind, Self and Somatic Awareness for the MBSR intervention effect were found. CONCLUSION: The results support that the MBSR program can alter self-reported resting state, towards less mind wandering and more comfort, measured by the ARSQ, and that this may explain some of the mechanisms regarding the effectiveness of MBSR on mental health at 6 months, when provided as a universal intervention. The study provides insight into an active ingredient of how MBSR may improve mental health and well-being. It supports the suggestions that mindfulness meditation may be a sustainable way of training the mental health.Clinical trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03886363.",

        "title": "Effects of a Mindfulness Meditation App on Subjective Well-Being: Active Randomized Controlled Trial and Experience Sampling Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training (MT) includes a variety of contemplative practices aimed at promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of nonjudgment and curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, manualized group interventions, MT has been implemented in a variety of modalities, including smartphone apps that seek to replicate the success of group interventions. However, although smartphone apps are scalable and accessible to a wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely untested. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate a newly developed MT app called Wildflowers, which was codeveloped with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It was hypothesized that 3 weeks of MT through this app would improve subjective well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with weaker effects than those published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention literature. METHODS: Undergraduate students completed 3 weeks of MT with Wildflowers (n=45) or 3 weeks of cognitive training with a game called 2048 (n=41). State training effects were assessed through pre- and postsession ratings of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait training effects were assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing subjective well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and interoceptive integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a multilevel model using emergent latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness) to summarize the trait questionnaire battery. RESULTS: Analyses revealed both state and trait effects specific to MT; participants engaging in MT demonstrated improved mood (r=.14) and a reduction of stress (r=-.13) immediately after each training session compared with before the training session and decreased postsession stress over 3 weeks (r=-.08). In addition, MT relative to cognitive training resulted in greater improvements in attentional control (r=-.24). Interestingly, both groups demonstrated increased subjective ratings of awareness (r=.28) and acceptance (r=.23) from pre- to postintervention, with greater changes in acceptance for the MT group trending (r=.21). CONCLUSIONS: MT, using a smartphone app, may provide immediate effects on mood and stress while also providing long-term benefits for attentional control. Although further investigation is warranted, there is evidence that with continued usage, MT via a smartphone app may provide long-term benefits in changing how one relates to their inner and outer experiences.

        "title": "Effects of a Mindfulness-Based Weight Loss Intervention on Long-Term Psychological Well-Being Among Adults with Obesity: Secondary Analyses from the Supporting Health by Integrating Nutrition and Exercise (SHINE) Trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study tested whether a mindfulness-based intervention for obesity that included components aimed at emotion regulation and mindful eating improved psychological outcomes including stress, anxiety, positive emotion, and depression, during the intervention period and at longer-term follow-up. METHODS: Adults with obesity (N=194) were randomized to a 5.5-month diet-exercise weight loss intervention with or without mindfulness training focused on emotion regulation and mindful eating. Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness and psychological well-being, which were planned secondary outcomes, at baseline, mid-intervention (3 months), and at 6-, 12-, and 18-months post-baseline (maintenance period). Mixed effects models and linear regression were used to test between- and within-group changes in psychological well-being. Finally, this study explored whether changes in mindfulness (from baseline to each 6- and 18-months post-baseline) mediated the effects of intervention arm on changes in psychological outcomes during those respective time periods. This study explored whether changes in mindfulness from baseline to 6 months mediated the effects of intervention arm on changes in psychological outcomes from baseline to 18 months. RESULTS: Participants randomized to the mindfulness arm had significant increases in positive emotions at all follow-up times compared to controls. There were statistically significant increases in mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and reflection, as well as decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms at 12 months compared to control participants. These changes remained significant for psychological flexibility and reflection at 18 months. There were no significant differences in perceived stress. Among mindfulness participants, greater increases in mindfulness from 6-18 months was associated with greater positive emotions and psychological flexibility as well as lower perceived stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and rumination at 18 months, adjusting for 6-month values. Mediation analyses indicated that randomization to the mindfulness intervention arm was associated with 6-month increases in mindfulness, and these increases were in turn associated with improved psychological outcomes at 6 months and 18 months. Changes from baseline to 18 months did not mediate 18-month changes in psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness training in emotion regulation and mindful eating may provide greater longer-term psychological well-being benefits in non-clinical populations with obesity compared to conventional diet-exercise interventions.",

        "title": "d-Serine is a potential biomarker for clinical response in treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder using (R,S)-ketamine infusion and TIMBER psychotherapy: A pilot study.",
        "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating condition that is often refractory to standard frontline antidepressant therapy. A promising new approach to PTSD therapy is administration of a single sub-anesthetic dose of (R,S)-ketamine (Ket). The treatment produces rapid and significant therapeutic response, which lasts for only 4-7 days. In one of our studies, the mean duration of response was increased to 33 days when Ket administration was combined with a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, Trauma Interventions using Mindfulness Based Extinction and Reconsolidation (TIMBER). We now report the results from a 20-patient study, which examined the duration of sustained response with combined TIMBER-Ket therapy, TIMBER-K arm, relative to the response observed in a placebo-controlled arm, TIMBER-P. A significant difference in the duration of response was observed between TIMBER-K and TIMBER-P arms: 34.44 \u00b1 19.12 days and 16.50 \u00b1 11.39 days, respectively (p = 0.022). Previous studies identified a negative correlation between antidepressant response to Ket and basal plasma concentrations of d-serine (DSR). In this study, the basal DSR levels positively correlated with the pre-treatment severity of PTSD symptoms (Pearson's r = 0.42, p = 0.07) and patients with basal DSR level \u2265 3.5 \u03bcM displayed not only higher PTSD severity but also shorter duration of response. The data indicate that basal DSR levels may serve as a biomarker of the severity of PTSD symptoms and as a predictor of clinical response.

        "title": "Study protocol for a randomized control trial to investigate the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) transdiagnostic group intervention for primary care patients.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effective transdiagnostic treatments for patients presenting with principal or comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression enable more efficient provision of mental health care and may be particularly suitable for the varied population seen in primary healthcare settings. Mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) is a transdiagnostic intervention that integrates aspects of CBT, including exposure skills targeting avoidance, with training in mindfulness meditation skills adopted from the Vipassana or insight tradition taught by the Burmese teachers U Ba Khin and Goenka. MiCBT is distinguished from both cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy by the use of a theoretical framework which proposes that the locus of reinforcement of behavior is the interoceptive experience (body sensations) that co-arises with self-referential thinking. Consequently, MiCBT has a strong focus on body scanning to develop interoceptive awareness and equanimity. Designed for clinical purposes, the four-stage systemic approach of MiCBT, comprising intra-personal (Stage 1) exposure (Stage 2), interpersonal (Stage 3), and empathic (Stage 4) skillsets, is a distinguishing feature among other mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how group MiCBT decreases depression and anxiety symptoms for patients with a range of common mental health conditions. METHODS: Participants (n = 120) recruited via medical practitioner referral will be randomized to MiCBT or a wait-list control. Inclusion criteria are age 18-75; fluent in English and having a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) score of 20 or more. The MiCBT treatment group receive an 8-week MiCBT intervention delivered in a private psychology practice. Participants complete a suite of online self-report measures and record the amount of meditation practice undertaken each week. The control group receive usual treatment and complete the measures at the same time points. Primary outcome measures are the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and K10. Analysis will use mixed-model repeated measures. DISCUSSION: The potential ability of MiCBT to provide a comprehensive therapeutic system that is applicable across diagnostic groups would make it an attractive addition to the available MBIs.

        "title": "A research protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial designed to examine the feasibility of a couple-based mind-body intervention for patients with metastatic lung cancer and their partners.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the generally incurable nature of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC), patients and their romantic partners are at risk for existential/spiritual distress. Although a handful of dyadic psychosocial interventions for lung cancer patients and their caregivers exist, none of them target spiritual well-being. Informed by the mindfulness-based intervention literature and our pilot work in couples affected by lung cancer, we developed a brief couple-based mind-body (CBMB) intervention. The primary aim of this research protocol is to determine the feasibility of implementing the CBMB intervention versus an active control (AC) or wait list control (WLC) group in patients with mNSCLC and their partners using a randomized controlled trial design. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with mNSCLC receiving treatment and their partners are randomized to the CBMB intervention, an AC or a WLC group. Those in the CBMB intervention and AC groups receive four intervention sessions of 60 min each over 4 weeks and complete weekly homework assignments. The first session is delivered in person, and the remaining sessions are delivered via videoconference. The dyads in the AC group discuss cancer-related and personal growth concerns with the interventionist but are not taught coping skills. Patients and partners in all groups complete baseline assessments of quality of life (QOL) prior to randomization. Follow-up assessments are performed 4 weeks and then again 3 months later. The primary outcome is feasibility (i.e., \u2265 30% of eligible couples consent, \u2265 70% of enrolled couples are retained, and \u2265 50% of all CBMB and AC sessions are attended). We will also perform primarily descriptive analyses of the self-reported outcomes (e.g., spiritual well-being and psychological distress) and explore potential intervention mediators (i.e., compassion, communication, mindfulness, and closeness) to inform a larger, future trial. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide important information regarding the feasibility of a behavioral intervention in a vulnerable yet understudied population using videoconferencing and descriptive data regarding spiritual well-being and other indices of QOL in both mNSCLC patients and their partners.

        "abstract": "At least a third of women across reproductive ages experience low sexual desire and impaired arousal. There is increasing evidence that mindfulness, defined as non-judgmental present moment awareness, may improve women's sexual functioning. The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy, either immediately or after a 3-month waiting period, in women seeking treatment for low sexual desire and arousal. Women participated in four 90-min group sessions that included mindfulness meditation, cognitive therapy, and education. A total of 117 women were assigned to either the immediate treatment (n = 68, mean age 40.8 yrs) or delayed treatment (n = 49, mean age 42.2 yrs) group, in which women had two pre-treatment baseline assessments followed by treatment. A total of 95 women completed assessments through to the 6-month follow-up period. Compared to the delayed treatment control group, treatment significantly improved sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, sexual satisfaction, and overall sexual functioning. Sex-related distress significantly decreased in both conditions, regardless of treatment, as did orgasmic difficulties and depressive symptoms. Increases in mindfulness and a reduction in depressive symptoms predicted improvements in sexual desire. Mindfulness-based group therapy significantly improved sexual desire and other indices of sexual response, and should be considered in the treatment of women's sexual dysfunction.",

        "title": "Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement reduces opioid craving among individuals with opioid use disorder and chronic pain in medication assisted treatment: Ecological momentary assessments from a stage 1 randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is an efficacious form of medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), yet many individuals on MMT relapse. Chronic pain and deficits in positive affective response to natural rewards may result in dysphoria that fuels opioid craving and promotes relapse. As such, behavioral therapies that ameliorate chronic pain and enhance positive affect may serve as useful adjuncts to MMT. This analysis of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from a Stage 1 randomized clinical trial examined effects of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) on opioid craving, pain, and positive affective state. METHODS: Participants with OUD and chronic pain (N = 30) were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or treatment as usual (TAU). Across 8 weeks of treatment, participants completed up to 112 random EMA measures of craving, pain, and affect, as well as event-contingent craving ratings. Multilevel models examined the effects of MORE on craving, pain, and affect, as well as the association between positive affect and craving. RESULTS: EMA showed significantly greater improvements in craving, pain unpleasantness, stress, and positive affect for participants in MORE than for participants in TAU. Participants in MORE reported having nearly 1.3 times greater self-control over craving than those in TAU. Further, positive affect was associated with reduced craving, an association that was significantly stronger among participants in MORE than TAU. CONCLUSION: MORE may be a useful non-pharmacological adjunct among individuals with OUD and chronic pain in MMT.",

        "abstract": "The aims of this study were twofold: (1) to investigate the effectiveness of web-based psychoeducation for emotional functioning, eating behaviors, and body image among premenopausal women with excess body weight, and (2) to compare the efficacy of two types of web-based psychoeducation. Three hundred individuals were asked to volunteer in the present study. All participants were recruited in Poland from September 2017 to July 2019. Finally, a total of 129 premenopausal women took part in the research and signed informed consent. Their ages ranged between 18 and 48 years old (M = 32.28, SD = 7.65). Self-reported weight and height were recorded. BMI was calculated using self-reported data. Their average body mass index was 30.54 kg/m(2) (SD = 3.69). In our randomized experiment, the participants were allocated into three groups: experimental group I (EG I, N = 43), experimental group II (EG II, N = 46), and wait list control group (CG, N = 40). Five questionnaires were included in the online survey at the baseline measurement (Day 0), at the end of psychoeducational intervention (Day 16) and 75 days from the start of the 15-day intervention (Day 76). Measurement tools included the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Mindful Eating Scale, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, and the Body Attitude Test. Our eHealth web-based psychoeducation consisted of three modules: emotional functioning module (EG I: theoretically consistent approach (TCA) vs EG II: eclectic approach; EA), eating behaviors module (EG I, EG II: based on mindfulness-based eating training; MET), body image module (EG I, EG II: based on Cash's prevention of body image disturbances; CPBID). The first experimental group (EG I) had intervention containing TCA, MET, and CPBID, while the second experimental group (EG II) EA, MET, and CPBID. According to between-group comparison, both types of web-based psychoeducation led to an increase in adaptive emotion regulation (Day 16: EG I vs CG: p < 0.001, EG II vs CG: p < 0.001; Day 76: EG I vs CG: p < 0.01, EG II vs CG: p < 0.001). In EG I, the intervention resulted in a higher reduction (than in CG) in emotional eating (Day 16: p < 0.01, Day 76: p < 0.01), uncontrolled eating (Day 16: p < 0.05, Day 76: p < 0.05), and negative appreciation of body size (Day 16: p < 0.01, Day 76: p < 0.01). In EG II, a lower level of emotional eating was found on Day 76 (EG II vs CG: p < 0.05). Two months after completion of the 15-day intervention, no statistically significant reduction for BMI was observed in either experimental group (p > 0.05). The effectiveness of both types of web-based psychoeducation was also confirmed in within-group comparison (Day 0 vs Day 16 and Day 0 vs Day 76). There was a significant increase in emotion regulation and mindful eating, as well as a decrease in emotional eating, uncontrolled eating, negative appreciation of body size, lack of familiarity with one's body, and the experiencing of negative emotions in both experimental groups (EG I, EG II). Both types of web-based psychoeducation might have to be considered in creating future web-based psychoeducation among premenopausal women with excess body weight.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) recruited from memory clinics have an increased risk of developing dementia and regularly experience reduced psychological well-being related to memory concerns and fear of dementia. Research on improving well-being in SCD is limited and lacks non-pharmacological approaches. We investigated whether mindfulness-based and health education interventions can enhance well-being in SCD. METHODS: The SCD-Well trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03005652) randomised 147 older adults with SCD to an 8-week caring mindfulness-based approach for seniors (CMBAS) or an active comparator (health self-management programme [HSMP]). Well-being was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month post-randomisation using the Psychological Well-being Scale (PWBS), the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment psychological subscale, and composites capturing meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, and insight. Mixed effects models were used to assess between- and within-group differences in change. RESULTS: CMBAS was superior to HSMP on changes in connection at post-intervention. Within both groups, PWBS total scores, psychological QoL, and composite scores did not increase. Exploratory analyses indicated increases in PWBS autonomy at post-intervention in both groups. CONCLUSION: Two non-pharmacological interventions were associated with only limited effects on psychological well-being in SCD. Longer intervention studies with waitlist/retest control groups are needed to assess if our findings reflect intervention brevity and/or minimal base rate changes in well-being.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The IMPACT BCN trial-a parallel-group randomized clinical trial where 1221 pregnant women at high risk for small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns were randomly allocated at 19- to 23-week gestation into three groups: Mediterranean diet, Mindfulness-based Stress reduction or non-intervention-has demonstrated a positive effect of Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction in the prevention of SGA. However, the mechanism of action of these interventions remains still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Mediterranean diet and Stress reduction on placental volume and perfusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the Mediterranean diet group received monthly individual and group educational sessions, and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Women in the Stress reduction group underwent an 8-week Stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 2.5-h and one full-day sessions. Non-intervention group was based on usual care. Placental volume and perfusion were assessed in a subgroup of randomly selected women (n = 165) using magnetic resonance (MR) at 36-week gestation. Small placental volume was defined as MR estimated volume <10th centile. Perfusion was assessed by intravoxel incoherent motion. RESULTS: While mean MR placental volume was similar among the study groups, both interventions were associated with a lower prevalence of small placental volume (3.9% Mediterranean diet and 5% stress reduction vs. 17% non-intervention; p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). Logistic regression showed that small placental volume was significantly associated with higher risk of SGA in both study groups (OR 7.48 [1.99-28.09] in Mediterranean diet and 20.44 [5.13-81.4] in Stress reduction). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of Mediterranean diet on SGA can be decomposed by a direct effect and an indirect effect (56.6%) mediated by a small placental volume. Similarly, the effect of Stress reduction on SGA is partially mediated (45.3%) by a small placental volume. Results on placental intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and diffusion coefficient were similar among the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Structured interventions during pregnancy based on Mediterranean diet or Stress reduction are associated with a lower proportion of small placentas, which is consistent with the previously observed beneficial effects of these interventions on fetal growth.",

OBJECTIVE: Building on previous work, we aimed to develop an app designed to help patients with multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia self-manage symptoms and test it for acceptability and preliminary efficacy. METHODS: We developed our Blood Cancer Coach app with input from clinicians and patients. Our 2-armed randomized controlled pilot trial recruited participants from Duke Health and nationally in partnerships with the Association of Oncology Social Work, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, and other patient groups. Participants were randomized to the attention control (Springboard Beyond Cancer website) arm or the Blood Cancer Coach app intervention arm. The fully automated Blood Cancer Coach app included symptom and distress tracking with tailored feedback, medication reminders and adherence tracking, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia education resources, and mindfulness activities. Patient-reported data were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks for both arms through the Blood Cancer Coach app. Outcomes of interest were global health (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health), posttraumatic stress (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5), and cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised). Among participants in the intervention arm, satisfaction surveys and usage data were used to evaluate acceptability. RESULTS: Among 180 patients who downloaded the app, 49% (89) of them consented to participate and 40% (72) of them completed baseline surveys. Of those who completed baseline surveys, 53% (38) of them completed week 4 surveys (16 intervention and 22 control) and 39% (28) of them completed week 8 surveys (13 intervention and 15 control). Most participants found the app at least moderately effective at helping manage symptoms (87%), feeling more comfortable seeking help (87%), increasing awareness of resources (73%), and reported being satisfied with the app overall (73%). Participants completed an average of 248.5 app tasks over the 8-week study period. The most used functions within the app were medication log, distress tracking, guided meditations, and symptom tracking. There were no significant differences between the control and intervention arms at week 4 or 8 on any outcomes. We also saw no significant improvement over time within the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our feasibility pilot were promising in which most participants found the app to be helpful in managing their symptoms, reported satisfaction with the app, and that it was helpful in several important areas. We did not, however, find significantly reduced symptoms or improved global mental and physical health over 2 months. Recruitment and retention were challenging for this app-based study, an experience echoed by others. Limitations included a predominantly White and college educated sample. Future studies would do well to include self-efficacy outcomes, target those with more symptoms, and emphasize diversity in recruitment and retention.

        "title": "Association of Short-term Change in Leukocyte Telomere Length With Cortical Thickness and Outcomes of Mental Training Among Healthy Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Telomere length is associated with the development of age-related diseases and structural differences in multiple brain regions. It remains unclear, however, whether change in telomere length is linked to brain structure change, and to what extent telomere length can be influenced through mental training. OBJECTIVES: To assess the dynamic associations between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and cortical thickness (CT), and to determine whether LTL is affected by a longitudinal contemplative mental training intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open-label efficacy trial of three 3-month mental training modules with healthy, meditation-naive adults was conducted. Data on LTL and CT were collected 4 times over 9 months between April 22, 2013, and March 31, 2015, as part of the ReSource Project. Data analysis was performed between September 23, 2016, and June 21, 2019. Of 1582 eligible individuals, 943 declined to participate; 362 were randomly selected for participation and assigned to training or retest control cohorts, with demographic characteristics matched. The retest control cohorts underwent all testing but no training. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. INTERVENTIONS: Training cohort participants completed 3 modules cultivating interoception and attention (Presence), compassion (Affect), or perspective taking (Perspective). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in LTL and CT. RESULTS: Of the 362 individuals randomized, 30 participants dropped out before study initiation (initial sample, 332). Data were available for analysis of the training intervention in 298 participants (n = 222 training; n = 76 retest control) (175 women [58.7%]; mean [SD] age, 40.5 [9.3] years). The training modules had no effect on LTL. In 699 observations from all 298 participants, mean estimated changes in the relative ratios of telomere repeat copy number to single-copy gene (T/S) were for no training, 0.004 (95% CI, -0.010 to 0.018); Presence, -0.007 (95% CI, -0.025 to 0.011); Affect, -0.005 (95% CI, -0.019 to 0.010); and Perspective, -0.001 (95% CI, -0.017 to 0.016). Cortical thickness change data were analyzed in 167 observations from 67 retest control participants (37 women [55.2%], mean [SD] age, 39.6 [9.0] years). In this retest control cohort subsample, naturally occurring LTL change was related to CT change in the left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex (mean t161 = 3.22; P < .001; r = 0.246). At the individual participant level, leukocyte telomere shortening as well as lengthening were observed. Leukocyte telomere shortening was related to cortical thinning (t77 = 2.38; P = .01; r = 0.262), and leukocyte telomere lengthening was related to cortical thickening (t77 = 2.42; P = .009; r = 0.266). All analyses controlled for age, sex, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this trial indicate an association between short-term change in LTL and concomitant change in plasticity of the left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex. This result contributes to the evidence that LTL changes more dynamically on the individual level than previously thought. Further studies are needed to determine potential long-term implications of such change in relation to cellular aging and the development of neurodegenerative disorders. No effect of contemplative mental training was noted in what may be, to date, the longest intervention with healthy adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01833104.",

The purpose of this sub-analysis of the total project, was to equate the effectiveness of the standard MBSR curriculum with the abbreviated version in minimizing anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 112 mentors and resident specialists from Family and Community Medicine and Nurses (FCMN), distributed across six teaching units (TU) of the Spanish National Health System (SNHS). Experimental group participants received a MBRS training (abbreviated/standard). Depression and anxiety levels were measured with the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS) at three different time periods during the analysis: before (pre-test) and after (post-test) participation, as well as 3 months after the completion of intervention. Taking into account the pre-test scores as the covariate, an adjusted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed significant depletion in anxiety and depression in general (F (2.91) = 4.488; p = 0.014; \u03b7(2) = 0.090) and depression in particular (F (2, 91) = 6.653; p = 0.002; \u03b7(2) = 0.128 at the post-test visit, maintaining their effects for 3 months (F (2.79) = 3.031; p = 0.050; \u03b7(2) = 0.071-F (2.79) = 2.874; p = 0.049; \u03b7(2) = 0.068, respectively), which is associated with the use of a standard training program. The abbreviated training program did not have a significant effect on the level of anxiety and depression. The standard MBSR training program had a positive effect on anxiety and depression and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and resident practitioners. New research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of abbreviated versions of training programs.",

        "title": "Loving-Kindness Colouring and Loving-Kindness Meditation: Exploring the Effectiveness of Non-Meditative and Meditative Practices on State Mindfulness and Anxiety.",
        "abstract": "Loving-kindness meditation has been recognized as a valuable form of meditation practice and features in most mindfulness programs. The present research explored the potential of an alternative non-meditative loving-kindness practice; namely, loving-kindness coloring. University students (N= 180) were randomly assigned to the loving-kindness coloring condition or the meditation condition. Both loving-kindness meditation and loving-kindness coloring were explored by measuring state mindfulness, pre-, and post-intervention. Results indicated that both conditions similarly increased in-state mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreased state anxiety, while there were non-significant differences between the practices. We concluded that there are similar levels of effectiveness to loving kindness meditation when introducing loving kindness coloring. Future implications on the applicability of loving-kindness practices are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Objectives: CaringBridge (CB) is an online health community for people undergoing challenging health journeys. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is a systemized mind-body approach developed to increase loving acceptance and has previously been reported to increase resilience in the face of adversity. Materials and Methods: Results of a randomized controlled trial of immediate compared with deferred 21-day LKM intervention in an online community are reported. The deferred group received LKM intervention after a waiting period of 3 weeks. Inclusion criteria were >18 years old, ability to understand English, willingness to participate in a mind-body practice, and use of CB for a cancer journey. Change in perceived stress, self-compassion, social connectedness and assurance, and compassionate love scales from baseline to 21 days was assessed. Results: Of the 979 participants included in the study, 649 (66%) provided 3-week follow-up data and 330 (49%) self-reported engaging in the LKM practice 5 or more days/week. Participants in the immediate LKM group reported medium effect size improvement in stress (0.4), self-compassion (0.5), and social connectedness (0.4) compared with the deferred LKM group. Changes in perceived stress and self-compassion were larger in magnitude and increased with more frequent engagement in LKM. Conclusions: The immediate LKM group showed improvements in stress, self-compassion, and social connectedness compared with the deferred control group. Differential study retention rates by treatment arm and self-reported engagement in LKM subject the results to selection bias. Future research of similar interventions within online health communities might pay greater attention to promoting intervention adherence and engaging a more diverse economic and racial/ethnic population.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Our recent finding of a meditation-related increase in low-frequency NREM sleep EEG oscillatory activities peaking in the theta-alpha range (4-12 Hz) was not predicted. From a consolidated body of research on sleep homeostasis, we would expect a change peaking in slow wave activity (1-4 Hz) following an intense meditation session. Here we compared these changes in sleep with the post-meditation changes in waking rest scalp power to further characterize their functional significance. High-density EEG recordings were acquired from 27 long-term meditators (LTM) on three separate days at baseline and following two 8-hr sessions of either mindfulness or compassion-and-loving-kindness meditation. Thirty-one meditation-naive participants (MNP) were recorded at the same time points. As a common effect of meditation practice, we found increases in low and fast waking EEG oscillations for LTM only, peaking at eight and 15 Hz respectively, over prefrontal, and left centro-parietal electrodes. Paralleling our previous findings in sleep, there was no significant difference between meditation styles in LTM as well as no difference between matched sessions in MNP. Meditation-related changes in wakefulness and NREM sleep were correlated across space and frequency. A significant correlation was found in the EEG low frequencies (<12 Hz). Since the peak of coupling was observed in the theta-alpha oscillatory range, sleep homeostatic response to meditation practice is not sufficient to explain our findings. Another likely phenomenon into play is a reverberation of meditation-related processes during subsequent sleep. Future studies should ascertain the interplay between these processes in promoting the beneficial effects of meditation practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "There is considerable interest in developing complementary and integrative approaches for ameliorating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compassion meditation (CM) and loving-kindness meditation appear to offer benefits to individuals with PTSD, including symptom reduction. The present study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of CM for PTSD in veterans. The CM condition, an adaptation of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT(R)), consists of exercises to stabilize attention, develop present-moment awareness, and foster compassion. We compared CM to Veteran.calm (VC), which consists of psychoeducation about PTSD, rationale for relaxation, relaxation training, and sleep hygiene. Both conditions consist of 10 weekly 90-min group sessions with between-session practice assignments. A total of 28 veterans attended at least one session of the group intervention and completed pre- and posttreatment measures of PTSD severity and secondary outcomes as well as weekly measures of PTSD, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative emotions. Measures of treatment credibility, attendance, practice compliance, and satisfaction were administered to assess feasibility. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a more substantive reduction in PTSD symptoms in the CM condition than in the VC condition, between-group d = -0.85. Credibility, attendance, and satisfaction were similar across CM and VC conditions thus demonstrating the feasibility of CM and the appropriateness of VC as a comparison condition. The findings of this initial randomized pilot study provide rationale for future studies examining the efficacy and effectiveness of CM for veterans with PTSD. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We aimed to assess Mindful Moment's feasibility, acceptability, and usability, and to gather preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in reducing parenting stress and outcomes such as mindful parenting, self-compassion, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, dispositional mindfulness, mother's perception of infant temperament, and mother-infant bonding. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was a two-arm trial and followed the CONSORT 2010, CONSORT-EHEALTH, and CONSORT-SPI 2018 extension guidelines. A total of 292 Portuguese mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 146) or to the waiting list control group (n = 146) and completed baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2) self-reported assessments. Results: A total of 31 mothers (21.23%) completed the Mindful Moment intervention. Most mothers evaluated the program as good or excellent (90%), considered that Mindful Moment provided them the kind of help they expected or wanted (61%), were satisfied with the help provided by the program (74.6%), would recommend it to a friend in a similar situation (86.4%), and would use it again if needed (81.4%). Regarding the program's preliminary effectiveness, mothers in the intervention group presented a greater decrease in parenting stress, a greater increase in dispositional mindfulness, and a greater decrease in their perception of the difficult temperament of their infants from T1 to T2. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the Mindful Moment's effectiveness and suggests that it is a feasible and acceptable program for postpartum mothers experiencing parenting stress. Further research is needed to confirm these results in a larger RCT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "title": "Training Emotion Cultivates Morality: How Loving-Kindness Meditation Hones Compassion and Increases Prosocial Behavior.",
        "abstract": "Traditional moral philosophy has long focused on rationality, principled thinking, and good old-fashioned willpower, but recent evidence strongly suggests that moral judgments and prosocial behavior are more heavily influenced by emotion and intuition. As the evidence mounts, rational traditions emphasizing deliberative analysis and conscious decision making are called into question. The first section highlights some compelling evidence supporting the primacy of affective states in motivating moral judgments and behavior. The real challenge is finding a way to align intuition with desired behavior. In cool reflective states, one may desire to be a kind and loving person. But when it is time to act, the moment is often accompanied by strong affect-laden intuitions. I argue that if affective states are the primary motivators of behavior, then moral sentiments must be trained through habituation in order to increase prosocial behavior. The second section provides empirical evidence linking emotional training with increased prosociality. To highlight this connection, focus is placed on the relationship between habitual meditation training, compassion, and prosocial behavior. Recent studies by Antoine Lutz, Richard Davidson, Susanne Leiberg, and others show that various meditation practices can dramatically affect the human person at various levels, i.e., increased physical health, neural restructuring, regulation and development of emotions, and increased helping behavior, to name a few. The current article focuses on the impact the habit of loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has on compassion and prosocial behavior. Recent studies strongly support the conclusion that LKM training hones compassion and ultimately leads to an increase in compassionate behavior. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) have emphasized the cultivation of ethics. However, some ethics and values that are emphasized in SG-MBIs are criticized by Confucianism, one of the most influential traditions in China. The current study developed a new SG-MBI called mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) that emphasized value clarification and integrated Confucian values. The acceptability and effects of this intervention were evaluated among Chinese people in mainland China. Methods: A total of 138 healthy Chinese adults from universities and communities were randomly assigned to the MBPP or waitlist condition. Consistent with the 'relief,' 'promotion,' and 'transcendence' modules in MBPP, variables representing negative symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress), positive traits (gratitude and appreciative joy), and spirituality (meaning of life) were measured before and after the 6-week intervention and 3 months after the intervention. The amount of meditation practice and ratings for MBPP and different themes were also measured. Results: Compared to the waitlist condition, MBPP significantly reduced anxiety and stress with low to medium effect sizes but not other measures. The amount of meditation practice during the intervention was significantly associated with changes in appreciative joy and gratitude. Participants rated the MBPP and themes highly, and themes in the 'transcendence' module received significantly lower ratings than other themes. Conclusions: MBPP is a feasible and promising SG-MBI for promoting mental health among Chinese. Future studies should further evaluate the acceptability and effects of the new components of SG-MBIs and develop suitable measurements for those idealistic mentalities proposed by Buddhism and other traditions.

In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) programme designed to increase self-compassion in a sample of self-critical individuals. Thirty-eight individuals with high scores on the self-critical perfectionism subscale of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale were randomized to an LKM condition ( n = 19) or a wait-list (WL) condition ( n = 19). Measures of self-criticism, self-compassion and psychological distress were administered before and immediately following the intervention (LKM or WL). WL participants received the intervention immediately after the waiting period. Both groups were assessed 3 months post-intervention. Intent-to-treat ( n = 38) and per-protocol analyses ( n = 32) showed significant reductions in self-criticism and depressive symptoms as well as significant increases in self-compassion and positive emotions in the LKM condition compared with the WL condition. A follow-up per-protocol analysis in both groups together ( n = 20) showed that these gains were maintained 3 months after the intervention.

        "abstract": "The present study involved developing a positive psychological intervention program for fostering selected positive psychological strengths and examining its efficacy in improving resilience among institutionalized adolescents at risk for developmental adaptation using a pre-post-follow-up control group design. The sample included 45 institutional adolescents (Males=22, Females=23) in the experimental group and 45 (Males=22, Females=23) in the control group. The intervention focused on improving probabilistic orientation, gratitude, and forgiveness using different methods of delivery including conceptual teaching, storytelling, exercises and loving-kindness meditation. The intervention was delivered in nine sessions spread over eight weeks. Self-reported measures of probabilistic orientation, forgiveness, forgiveness likelihood, gratitude, and resilience were used to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Academic achievement, an objective measure obtained from the school records was also included to assess the efficacy of the intervention. ANCOVA, ANOVA, and Student's t-test were used to analyze the data. The findings suggest that the evidence-based positive intervention had improved the probabilistic orientation, forgiveness, and gratitude of the institutionalized adolescents. Further, the intervention is found to have resulted in the enhancement of resilience, academic achievement, as well as the overall well-being of the participants. The findings confirm that enriching the inner protectors of the adolescents at-risk may be effective in enhancing their developmental adaptation and well-being thanks to the interaction between the protectors and the risk factors in the environment.

Through a series of eight experiments (N > 1,400), we demonstrate that state mindfulness cultivated via focused-breathing meditation can dampen the relationship between transgressions and the desire to engage in reparative prosocial behaviors. Experiment 1 showed that induced state mindfulness reduced state guilt. Experiments 2a-2c found that induced state mindfulness reduced the willingness to engage in reparative behaviors in normally guilt-inducing situations. Experiments 3a and 3b found that guilt mediated the negative effect of mindfulness meditation on prosocial reparation. Experiment 4 demonstrated that induced state mindfulness weakened the link between a transgression and reparative behavior, as well as documented the mediating role of guilt over and above other emotions. Finally, in Experiment 5, we found that loving kindness meditation led to significantly more prosocial reparation than focused-breathing meditation, mediated by increased other-focus and feelings of love.

They were assessed at baseline, posttreatment and 12-month follow-up. The main outcome was 'emotional eating' (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, DEBQ); other eating behaviours were also assessed along with psychological and physiological variables. Results 'Mindful eating' + TAU reduced emotional eating both at posttreatment (B = -0.27; p = 0.006; d = 0.35) and follow-up (B = -0.53; p < 0.001; d = 0.69) compared to the control group (TAU alone).

Significant effects at follow-up were observed for some secondary outcomes related to bulimic behaviours, mindful eating, mindfulness, and self-compassion. Weight and other physiological parameters were not significantly affected by 'mindful eating' + TAU. Conclusions These findings support the efficacy of the 'mindful eating' + TAU programme for reducing emotional and external eating, along with some other secondary measures, but no significant changes in weight reduction were observed.

Participants were asked to judge whether the stimulus was a painful picture or a non-painful picture. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses revealed that the LPP amplitudes over the central-parietal area elicited by the painful pictures were significantly more positive than those before the meditation practices in the ibLKM and FAM groups. The P3 amplitudes over the central-parietal area were significantly more positive in the posttest than in the pretest when viewing painful pictures in the FAM group. In contrast, in the ibLKM, the P3 amplitudes were not significantly different in the pretest and posttest when viewing painful pictures.

        "abstract": "Meditation has been integrated into different therapeutic interventions. To inform the evidence-based selection of specific meditation types it is crucial to understand the neural processes associated with different meditation practices. Here we explore commonalities and differences in electroencephalographic oscillatory spatial synchronisation patterns across three important meditation types. Highly experienced meditators engaged in focused attention, open monitoring, and loving kindness meditation. Improving on previous research, our approach avoids comparisons between groups that limited previous findings, while ensuring that the meditation states are reliably established. Employing a novel measure of neural coupling - the imaginary part of EEG coherence - the study revealed that all meditation conditions displayed a common connectivity pattern that is characterised by increased connectivity of (a) broadly distributed delta networks, (b) left-hemispheric theta networks with a local integrating posterior focus, and (c) right-hemispheric alpha networks, with a local integrating parieto-occipital focus. Furthermore, each meditation state also expressed specific synchronisation patterns differentially recruiting left- or right-lateralised beta networks. These observations provide evidence that in addition to global patterns, frequency-specific inter-hemispheric asymmetry is one major feature of meditation, and that mental processes specific to each meditation type are also supported by lateralised networks from fast-frequency bands.

Twenty-two male Chinese expert meditators (11 FAM experts,  11 LKM experts) and 22 male Chinese novice meditators (11 FAM novices, 11 LKM  novices) had their brain activity monitored by a 3T MRI scanner while performing  the cognitive and affective tasks in both meditation and baseline states. We  examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and expertise  (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a conjunction approach  to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert meditative state. Additionally,  exclusive masking techniques revealed distinct interactions between state and  group during LKM and FAM. Specifically, we demonstrated that the practice of FAM  was associated with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural  activation differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of  state LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance. On the  other hand, both FAM and LKM practice appeared to affect the neural responses to  affective pictures. For viewing sad faces, the regions activated for FAM  practitioners were consistent with attention-related processing; whereas  responses of LKM experts to sad pictures were more in line with differentiating  emotional contagion from compassion/emotional regulation processes. Our findings  provide the first report of distinct neural activity associated with forms of  meditation during sustained attention and emotion processing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Young adults undergoing psychological changes are particularly vulnerable. Recent social isolation impedes interpersonal help while stress from family, school, work, and society has brought negative effects on mental health, even in otherwise healthy young adults. Recent research has shown that daily creativity contributes to well-being. To circumvent issues of contamination, we tried a NAO robot guiding a Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM) and Walking Meditation (WM). By improving mental states (i.e. positive valence and state openness), we stimulated creative behavior to reduce negative mood. Participants (N = 142) were healthy individuals, aged between 18 and 34, joining a one-time laboratory experiment. They responded to two rounds of questionnaires, with a 10 min intervention guided by audio or a NAO robot in between each round. A control group with participants with no treatment (i.e. taking a 10 min rest) was added for comparison. Both audio-guided LKM and WM successfully evoked state openness, with the former also exerting a positive effect on valence. Valence and state openness were positively correlated, and both were associated with a higher willingness to create. With positive valence, young adults likely perform better on convergent thinking.

        "title": "Using group-based interactive video teleconferencing to make self-compassion more accessible: A randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objective: Many interventions designed to increase self-compassion are either (1) intense, group-based, and face-to-face delivered programs, such as Mindful Self-Compassion, or (2) less intense, self-administered interventions, such as self-compassionate writing or following guided meditations. This study explores if self-compassion can be increased in a novel intervention that is both intense and accessible using online group-based interactive video teleconferencing. Method: One-hundred-fifty-five healthy participants (130 women, 25 men) were randomized to a wait-list control group or to an intervention group that participated in two online workshops (via Zoom) and completed a self-compassionate writing exercise. Participants filled out the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) before, directly after, and 1-week after the intervention. We assessed overall self-compassion, in addition to its six constituent subfactors: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. We analyzed all results using an intent-to-treat approach. In addition, participants' impressions and feasibility of the intervention were assessed. Results: Using linear mixed models, we found that the intervention increased total self-compassion as indicated by a significant interaction of Time and Treatment, F(2, 203.38) = 5.47, p = .005, with a small-to-medium effect, f = 0.22. Contrasts indicated significant differences between the intervention and the control group at the 1-week follow-up, but not directly after the intervention. We found similar effects for self-kindness, common humanity, and isolation. Qualitative answers indicated that participants liked the intervention and were pleased with the opportunity to interact with other participants. Conclusions: Self-compassion can be trained using interactive video teleconferencing interventions. The study highlights the potential benefits of group-based interventions as they allow for more interactions among participants, which in turn could reduce feelings of isolation. Finally, interactive video teleconferencing interventions have large unexplored potential for improving various resources that improve mental health or other facets of well-being other than self-compassion and this article gives recommendations for how to structure such interventions.

        "title": "Attachment insecurity moderates emotion responses to mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation in adults raised in low socioeconomic status households",
        "abstract": "Research on attachment theory holds that insecure attachment influences people's daily social and emotional experiences. Mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation have been associated with improvements in physical and mental well-being often through their influence on emotion experience and regulation. Yet, little research has examined how emotional well-being may be improved in insecurely attached individuals through meditation practice. We suspected that the emotion profiles of anxious and avoidant attachment may shift with meditation training, both across time and on a particular day. Improving emotional well-being may be especially consequential for those most at risk for negative health outcomes in late life. A diverse community sample of midlife adults raised in low-SES homes (N = 113; 55% white, 87.5% female) completed daily emotion reports for 10 weeks, during which they received 6 weeks of meditation training, randomized to either loving-kindness or mindfulness meditation practice. Results from growth curve analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety and randomized to mindfulness meditation reported significant increases over time in positive emotions alongside decreases in negative emotions. Those high in attachment avoidance reported significant decreases in negative emotions in both meditation groups. On the daily level, within-person dose-response analyses revealed that individuals with greater attachment anxiety showed the most consistent dose-response relations between the duration of either meditation practice and same-day increases in positive emotions and decreases in negative emotions. These findings highlight how meditation interventions can shift emotion profiles of insecurely attached midlife adults who are at heightened risk for late life chronic illnesses.

        "abstract": "Positive emotional perceptions and healthy emotional intelligence (EI) are important for social functioning. In this study, we investigated whether loving kindness meditation (LKM) combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would facilitate improvements in EI and changes in affective experience of visual stimuli. LKM has been shown to increase positive emotional experiences and we hypothesized that tDCS could enhance these effects. Eighty-seven undergraduates were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of LKM or a relaxation control recording with anodal tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left dlPFC) or right temporoparietal junction (right TPJ) at 0.1 or 2.0 milliamps. The primary outcomes were self-reported affect ratings of images from the International Affective Picture System and EI as measured by the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Results indicated no effects of training on EI, and no main effects of LKM, electrode placement, or tDCS current strength on affect ratings. There was a significant interaction of electrode placement by meditation condition (p = 0.001), such that those assigned to LKM and right TPJ tDCS, regardless of current strength, rated neutral and positive images more positively after training. Results suggest that LKM may enhance positive affective experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Over the past fifteen years, positive psychology research has validated a set of happiness enhancing techniques. These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program - PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls. Our results suggest that the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation can be an effective option to organize and deliver positive integrative interventions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Combinations of multiple meditation practices have been shown to reduce the attrition of telomeres, the protective caps of chromosomes (Carlson et al., 2015). Here, we probed the distinct effects on telomere length (TL) of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Midlife adults (N = 142) were randomized to be in a waitlist control condition or to learn either MM or LKM in a 6-week workshop. Telomere length was assessed 2 weeks before the start of the workshops and 3 weeks after their termination. After controlling for appropriate demographic covariates and baseline TL, we found TL decreased significantly in the MM group and the control group, but not in the LKM group. There was also significantly less TL attrition in the LKM group than the control group. The MM group showed changes in TL that were intermediate between the LKM and control groups yet not significantly different from either. Self-reported emotions and practice intensity (duration and frequency) did not mediate these observed group differences. This study is the first to disentangle the effects of LKM and MM on TL and suggests that LKM may buffer telomere attrition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although it has been determined that mindfulness meditations are positively related to personality constructs such as conscientiousness, there is no clear evidence of whether personality can influence the effectiveness of mindfulness intervention. The aim of the current research was to investigate the immediate effects of single sessions of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on state anxiety and state mindfulness and establish whether there is a difference between the outcomes of the two practices. Altruism and boredom were used as covariates to observe whether they have a significant impact on the final results. participants and procedure University students (N = 80) were randomly allocated to either the MM or LKM condition and were asked to complete the scales before and after they listened to audio guided meditation instructions. Prior to the meditation participants completed state mindfulness and state anxiety scales. Post-meditation participants again filled in state mindfulness and state anxiety scales, and trait scales on altruism and boredom. RESULTS: The results indicated that both types of mindfulness-based practices successfully decreased the initial levels of anxiety and elevated state mindfulness. Non-significant differences between the outcomes of the meditative practices were observed when controlling for altruism and boredom. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative practices appeal more to some participants than to others. Clinical implications are discussed with a focus on the beneficial effects of both MM and LKM.

Music listening is also a popular form of emotion regulation used to enhance well-being. This interdisciplinary study evaluated a novel intervention called Convergence-combining LKM with accompanying classical guitar music-and its effects on adults' well-being, mindfulness, compassion and self-compassion outcomes. Convergence was compared to active control groups LKM-only and Music-only regarding their relative effectiveness in improving these outcomes. Participants (N = 78; aged 18 to 69 years; 90% females; recruited from the general public) were assigned to either the Convergence, LKM-only, or Music-only condition. Each condition received a 2-hour workshop, involving psychoeducation, three prerecorded meditations, and group enquiry and discussion. Participants were assessed at pre-program, post-program, and 4-week follow-up. Findings revealed that Convergence, LKM-only and Music-only were equally effective interventions, producing improvements in dependent variables with small effect sizes. There was no additive effect of the components when delivered together as Convergence. Significant correlations were found between the amount of home practice, and mindfulness and self-compassion at follow-up. LKM, music listening and Convergence all provide brief, evidence-based alternatives for improving well-being.

        "abstract": "Background: Mindfulness-based interventions, self-compassion training, and cognitive behavioral therapy have garnered much evidence in its salutary effects on mental health. With increasing application of smartphone and mobile technology on health promotion, this study investigated the efficacy and possible moderators of mindfulness, self- compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation training mobile apps in the improvement of mental health. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of 3 mobile app-based programs: mindfulness-based program, self-compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation program in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. Changes in mindful awareness and self-compassion were also assessed. To further delineate the suitability of each program for different types of individuals, individual difference variables (ie, discomfort with emotions and tolerance for ambiguity) were explored for potential moderation. Methods: This study was a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial examining the efficacy of mindfulness-based program, self- compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation. Participants were randomized into either 1 of the 3 conditions. Throughout the 4-week, 28-session program, participants spent 10-15 min daily reviewing the course content and practicing various related exercises. At preprogram, postprogram, and 3-month follow-up, participants also completed Web-based measures of mental well-being, psychological distress, mindful-awareness, and self-compassion as well as the proposed moderators. Results: Among the 2161 study participants, 508 and 349 completed the post- and 3-month follow-up assessment, respectively. All 3 conditions (mindfulness-based program: N=703; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation: N=753; self-compassion program: N=705) were found to be efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. All conditions enhanced mindful awareness at postprogram. Significant interaction effect was found on self-compassion; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation and self-compassion program, but not mindfulness-based program, significantly enhanced self-compassion at postprogram. No significant differences regarding usage and users' satisfaction were found among the 3 conditions. None of the proposed moderators were found to be significant. Conclusions: Mindfulness-based, self-compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation mobile apps were efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress among adults at postprogram and 3-month follow-up. Future app-based psychological training programs should consider gamification and personalization of content or feedback to enhance engagement and mitigate the high attrition rates that are common in app-based health promotion programs.

        "abstract": "Background Previous research has proposed that there may be potential synergies between psychedelic and meditation interventions, but there are still knowledge gaps that merit further investigation. Methods Using a longitudinal observational research design with samples representative of the US and UK adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 9732), we investigated potential associations between self-reported psychedelic use and meditation practice. Results The follow-up survey was completed by 7667 respondents (79% retention rate), with 100 respondents reporting psychedelic use during the 2-month study period (1.3% of follow-up respondents). In covariate-adjusted regression models, psychedelic use during the study period was associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.40, p = 0.004). Among those who reported psychedelic use during the study period, covariate-adjusted regression models revealed that the subjective experience of insight during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in that period was also associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness and loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.42, p = 0.021; B = 0.38, p = 0.017). Notably, more days of loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week at baseline was associated with less severe subjective feelings of death or dying during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in the study period (B = -0.29, p = 0.037). Conclusions Psychedelic use might lead to greater engagement with meditation practices such as mindfulness meditation, while meditation practices such as loving-kindness or compassion medication might buffer against certain challenging experiences associated with psychedelic use.

        "abstract": "Meditation practice is suggested to engage training of cognitive control systems in the brain. To evaluate the functional involvement of attentional and cognitive monitoring processes during meditation, the present study analysed the electroencephalographic synchronization of fronto-parietal (FP) and medial-frontal (MF) brain networks in highly experienced meditators during different meditation states (focused attention, open monitoring and loving kindness meditation). The aim was to assess whether and how the connectivity patterns of FP and MF networks are modulated by meditation style and expertise. Compared to novice meditators, (1) highly experienced meditators exhibited a strong theta synchronization of both FP and MF networks in left parietal regions in all mediation styles, and (2) only the connectivity of lateralized beta MF networks differentiated meditation styles. The connectivity of intra-hemispheric theta FP networks depended non-linearly on meditation expertise, with opposite expertise-dependent patterns found in the left and the right hemisphere. In contrast, inter-hemispheric FP connectivity in faster frequency bands (fast alpha and beta) increased linearly as a function of expertise. The results confirm that executive control systems play a major role in maintaining states of meditation. The distinctive lateralized involvement of FP and MF networks appears to represent a major functional mechanism that supports both generic and style-specific meditation states. The observed expertise-dependent effects suggest that functional plasticity within executive control networks may underpin the emergence of unique meditation states in expert meditators.

        "abstract": "Objective: The aims of this study were (a) to examine the effects of a 6 weeks web-based mindful self-compassion program on stress and burnout symptoms in a group of practicing psychologists, and (b) to examine relationships between changes in self-compassion and self-coldness and changes in stress and burnout symptoms. Method: In a randomized controlled trial, 101 practicing psychologists were assigned to a training group (n = 51) or a wait-list control group (n = 49). The training encompassed 15 min exercises per day, 6 days a week, for 6 weeks. The participants completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) pre and post intervention. Results: Eighty-one participants (n = 40 in the training group, n = 41 in the control group) took part in the pre and post intervention assessments. Selective gains for the intervention group were observed for SCS total scores (d = 0.86; d = 0.94 for the SCS), FFMQ scores (d = 0.60), while levels of self-coldness was reduced (d = 0.73). Critically, levels of perceived stress (d = 0.59) and burnout symptoms (d = 0.44 for SMBQ total) were additionally lowered post intervention. Finally, the results confirmed the hypothesis that the measures of distress would be more strongly related to self-coldness than self-compassion, a pattern seen in cross-sectional analyses and, for burnout, also in the longitudinal analyses. Conclusions: This training program appeared effective to increase self-compassion/reduce self-coldness, and to alleviate stress and symptoms of burnout and provide support of the distinction between self-compassion and self-coldness. Additional studies, preferably three-armed RCTs with long-term follow-up, are warranted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the program.

The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effects of the mindfulness (MB) and positive behavior support (PBS) components against the MBPBS program for mindful parenting. Methods: The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e., aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers' requests). Results: Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the children's aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition, respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to mothers' requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then PBS. Changes across all variables for both mothers and their children were maintained for 3 years post-intervention. After time and training type were controlled for, meditation time was a significant predictor in reducing aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and in enhancing compliance of the children with mothers' requests. Conclusions: Positive outcomes for mothers and their children with ASD were significantly greater in the MBPBS condition, followed by the MB condition, and least in the PBS condition.

        "abstract": "Based on its role in social processing and stress, oxytocin was suggested to mediate stress reduction after compassion-based mental training. In the ReSource Project, a 9-month longitudinal mental training study, we first examined oxytocin's role in psychosocial stress reduction after training socio-affective (i.e., compassion-based, Affect Module), socio-cognitive or attentional skills (Perspective and Presence Modules, n=313). In a second study, using a subsample (n=113), we explored the effect of one compassion (Loving-kindness) meditation (LKM) on oxytocin, cortisol and subjective responses after 3-month Affect training (vs. rest with no training). Independent of training, stress triggered acute oxytocin release (p<0.001). LKM did not elicit acute oxytocin responses. Training effects were found in overall oxytocin levels in both studies. Compared to no training, Affect training decreased overall oxytocin during stress (p<0.05, d=0.50) but increased it during LKM (p<0.001, d=-0.72). Overall oxytocin changes were unrelated to cortisol and subjective stress reactivity. Based on Quintana and Guastella's (2020) theory of oxytocin as an allostatic hormone with anticipatory features, we interpret training-induced oxytocin changes as shifts in the anticipated emotional relevance of events. After 3-month Affect training, stress may have lost its emotional saliency, while LKM gained in emotional relevance. Finally, oxytocin does not mediate stress reduction after mental training.

In the advanced online publication, there was an error in the sixth author's name. 'Salzburg' should be 'Salzberg'. The name appears correctly in this record.] Objectives People raised in low-socioeconomic status (SES) households are at an increased risk for physical illness in adulthood. A shift in gene expression profiles in the immune system is one biological mechanism thought to account for elevated disease susceptibility, with a frequently investigated profile being the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral and antibody-related genes. Methods The present study investigated, in a sample of at-risk midlife adults (N = 88), whether those randomized to learn loving-kindness meditation (LKM) in a 6-week workshop would show a reduction in CTRA gene expression, compared to those randomized to learn mindfulness meditation (MM). We assessed emotions daily and hypothesized positive emotions to account for the expected effect of LKM on gene expression. Results Results showed significant group differences from pre- to post-intervention, yet in the opposite direction as hypothesized: Participants randomized to the MM group showed significant declines in CTRA gene expression, whereas those in the LKM group showed significant increases in CTRA gene expression. Both groups showed increases over the 6 weeks in daily reports of positive emotions (b = .007, p < .001) alongside decreases in negative emotions (b = - .005, p < .001). Thus, positive emotions were not pursued as a candidate mediator of observed group effects. Conclusions This study is the first to examine whether the biological impact of childhood low SES can be reversed in midlife through meditation interventions.

As a differential approach towards LKM and CM can promote a more accurate integration of these practices into the clinical field, it is worth studying their differential effects. The present preregistered study, thus, aimed to experimentally compare effects of single-session LKM and CM on first-time practitioners' emotions. Methods: Two hundred and one university students were randomly allocated to three (LKM, CM, and control) groups. The self-reported emotions were measured twice, before and after completing an assigned task. Results: Both LKM and CM significantly increased other-focused positive emotions, compared with the control condition. Both LKM and CM increased happiness and overall positive emotions and decreased sadness; however, the effect sizes of LKM were consistently larger compared to those of CM. Both LKM and CM significantly increased low arousal positive emotions, compared with the control condition. Conclusions: LKM and CM represent two theoretically different practices. However, as they belong to the same tradition of meditation, they are similar in their intention of forming positive wishes towards self and others, and this appeared to have a positive effect on practitioners' emotional experience. At the same time, LKM was found to be more effective in evoking positive emotions in first-time practitioners, compared with CM. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

Within the repertoire of positive psychology interventions, the practice of compassion may be a particularly redemptive for these individuals given their deficits in this domain. Helping has previously been found to boosts momentary positive affect in nonaltruists (Conway, Rogelberg, & Pitts, 2009). Consequently, we hypothesized that individuals low on trait Agreeableness would report greater benefits from compassion interventions, including reductions in depression and increases in life satisfaction. Two compassion exercises were investigated: (a) a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) exercise, and (b) an acts of kindness exercise. These were compared with a control condition involving the journaling of interpersonal relationships. Participants were drawn from an international sample (N = 648) and were randomly assigned to one of the 3 conditions. All groups completed their exercise online every other day for 3 weeks.

All participants completed positive and negative mental health measures at baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments. LKM participants additionally completed the same measures before and after treatment. Multiple analyses of variance were conducted to test for short- and long-term effects of LKM on positive and negative mental health measures. Results: A significant short-term effect of LKM on anxiety and PMH was found. Long-term analyses revealed a significant decrease of depression, anxiety, and stress for LKM completers, and a significant increase of depression, anxiety, and stress for the control group. Conclusions: The results suggest that LKM enhances mental health in university students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are often stressed due to the demands of the job, including the nature and severity of challenging behaviors of the clients, work conditions, degree of management support for the staff, and the demands of implementing some interventions under adverse conditions. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and PBS alone have been shown to be effective in assisting caregivers to better manage the challenging behaviors of clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The aim of the present study was to undertake a head-to-head assessment of the effectiveness of MBPBS and PBS alone in a 40-week randomized controlled trial. Of the 123 caregivers who met inclusion criteria, 60 were randomly assigned to MBPBS and 63 to PBS alone, with 59 completing the trial in the MBPBS condition and 57 in the PBS alone condition. Results showed both interventions to be effective, but the caregiver, client, and agency outcomes for MBPBS were uniformly superior to those of PBS alone condition. In addition, the MBPBS training was substantially more cost-effective than the PBS alone training. The present results add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of MBPBS and, if independently replicated, could provide an integrative health care approach in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities.

        "title": "Mindfulness and empathy: Differential effects of explicit and implicit Buddhist teachings",
        "abstract": "Several authors argue that interpersonal changes such as benevolence, compassion, and empathy should naturally emerge from adiligent practice of mindfulness. While empirical data from secularized and standardized mindfulness interventions do not fully support this assumption, a group of authors suggest that making underlying Buddhist teachings explicit within mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) might be a key factor in the modification of such culturally rooted aspects of interpersonal functioning. In order to investigate this suggestion, we compared a mindfulness program that explicitly integrates elements of Buddhist ethics(i.e., the four immeasurables) and wisdom (i.e., interdependency, non-self, common humanity) (ethics-oriented mindfulness training (EMT)), to a standard mindfulness training (SMT) program and a control group (i.e., waiting list), with a randomized controlled design in a community sample. Empathy components (i.e., affective responding, mentalization, emotion regulation,and behavioral responding), as well as variables that are typically associated with MBIs (i.e., mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being) were assessed using multi-dimensional measures (i.e., self-reported, behavioral, physiological). Results showed no overall effects on empathy of our interventions in comparison with our control group. With regard to other variables, we found specific effects for each of our interventions. Whereas SMT led to a stable increase in mindfulness (Cohen's d = .7), EMT led instead to increases in self-compassion (Cohen's d = .8) and subjective well-being (Cohen's d = .54). Although challenging theoretical expectations, we posit that our lack of empathy effects might be explained by several factors such as program structure, individual differences, and culture.

        "abstract": "Armed Forces personnel are exposed to traumatic experiences during their work; therefore, they are at risk of developing emotional difficulties such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following traumatic experiences. Despite evidence to suggest that self-compassion is effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD, and greater levels of self-compassion are associated with enhanced resilience, self-compassion in armed forces personnel and armed forces veterans remains under-researched. As a result, it is not known if therapeutic approaches that use self-compassion interventions are an acceptable and effective treatment for this population. Having previously shown that a one-off self-compassion exercise has temporary beneficial psychophysiological effects in non-clinical participants, we conducted this proof-of concept study to investigate whether this exercise is equally beneficial in veterans who had experienced deployment to a combat zone. Additionally, we examined if brief a self-compassion exercise can temporarily reduce hyperarousal symptoms and increase feelings of social connectedness. The current study also investigated the association between PTSD symptom severity, emotion regulation, and self-compassion in 56 veterans. All participants listened to a loving-kindness meditation for self-compassion (LKM-S) and psychophysiological recordings were taken throughout. Psychophysiological effects were observed including heart-rate (HR), skin conductance (SCL), and heart-rate variability (HRV) to determine associations with PTSD and changes in response associated with the self-compassion induction. PTSD symptom severity, dispositional emotion regulation, and self-compassion were measured, and participants also completed state measures of hyperarousal and social connectedness before and after the LKM-S. The findings partially demonstrated that self-compassion can be elicited in a veteran population but there were considerable individual differences in psychophysiological responses. The findings are discussed in light of existing theories of PTSD and self-compassion and the implications of using self-compassion based psychological approaches with veterans.

Following this treatment focus, the objective of the present study was to examine whether the combination of metta (Loving Kindness) group meditation and subsequent tailored individual therapy focusing on kindness towards oneself and others (metta-based therapy, MBT) shows greater improvements in depressive symptoms than a wait list control group in patients with chronic depression. Methods: Forty-eight patients with DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder were randomly assigned to MBT or a wait list control condition. Outcome was assessed after group meditation, after subsequent individual therapy, and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was an independent blind rating of depressive symptoms at post-test. Secondary outcome included changes in self-reported depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, compassion, and clinician-rated emotion regulation. Results: Mixed-design analyses showed significant differences between MBT and WLC in changes from pre- to post-test in clinician-rated and self-rated depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, and emotion regulation. Most of the changes occurred during group meditation and were associated with large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: The results provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of MBT in treating chronic depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

In the original article, there was an error in Table 1. A few labels were misplaced. The corrected table is included in the erratum. The original article has been corrected.] Objectives: Engaging in meditation seems to be an effective manner of bettering psychosocial health. Although these findings hold for most people, individual differences may affect who gets greater gains from meditation. Psychological (i.e., resilience, spirituality) and biological (i.e., cardiac vagal tone, oxytocin) personal resources may work individually or synergistically to catalyze meditation-related improvements in mental health, such as increased positive (well-being) and decreased negative (depression) mental health symptoms. Methods: A community-based sample of 210 adults (modeage = 35 years; 61.86% female) were recruited and randomly assigned to either mindfulness (n = 107; 51.2%) or loving-kindness (n = 102; 48.8%) meditation conditions (1 missing). The study lasted 18 months, starting with baseline measures, succeeded by a 6-week meditation intervention, and follow-up assessments every 3 months. Results: The fixed effect of resilience was significant, as was the interaction between resilience and time, indicating different mental health symptom trajectories during and after a meditation intervention based on resilience. Conclusions: Participants low in resilience tended to have the greatest gains (increased subjective well-being and decreased depressive symptoms) following a meditation intervention, yet these gains were not maintained 18 months following the intervention. Those high in resilience did not show mental health gains following a meditation intervention but did have higher subjective well-being symptoms 18 months following the intervention indicating that they may have experienced delayed gains.

        "abstract": "Objective: Meditation interventions promote an array of well-being outcomes. However, the way in which these interventions promote beneficial outcomes is less clear. Here, we expanded on prior work by examining the influence of mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation on a key health behavior: physical activity. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we drew upon two randomized intervention studies. In the first study, 171 adults (73.0% female) received 6 weeks of training in either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation, or were assigned to a control condition. In the second study, 124 adults (60.0% female) were assigned to a 6-week mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation group. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that individuals who received mindfulness training reported sustained levels of physical activity across the intervention period (Pre: mean [standard deviation], or M [SD] = 4.09 [2.07]; Post: M [SD] = 3.68 [2.00]; p = .054), whereas those in the control (Pre: M [SD] = 3.98 [2.25]; Post: M [SD] = 3.01 [2.07]; p < .001) and loving-kindness (Pre: M [SD] = 4.11 [2.26]; Post: M [SD] = 3.45 [1.96]; p < .001) conditions reported lower levels. Study 2 demonstrated those who received mindfulness training experienced increases in positive emotions during physical activity from preintervention to postintervention (Pre: M [SD] = 6.06 [2.51]; Post: M [SD] = 6.54 [2.43]; p = .001), whereas those trained in loving-kindness meditation experienced decreases in positive emotions during physical activity (Pre: M [SD] = 6.45 [2.35]; Post: M [SD] = 6.09 [2.46]; p = .040). Conclusions: These results suggest mindfulness training (but not loving-kindness training) promotes sustained physical activity, and one plausible reason why this occurs is enhanced positive emotion during physical activity.

Methods: Individuals' responses (self-report, heart rate, heart rate variability and skin conductance) during a previously validated brief self-compassion exercise were assessed in a repeated-measures experimental design at two timepoints 2.5-3 months apart in a convenience sample of remitted depressed attendees of an outpatient clinic for mood disorders. The first group received eight sessions of MBCT (n = 25) in between the two measurements whereas the second group was an untreated control group (n = 25). Results: When the MBCT group engaged in the self-compassion exercise after MBCT, they showed reduced physiological arousal and increased heart rate variability whereas no changes were observed in the untreated control group. Whereas self-reported state self-compassion after the exercise increased in both groups at both timepoints, only in the MBCT group were the overall levels of state and dispositional self-compassion increased significantly. Conclusion: MBCT appears to effectively reduce negative self-bias and facilitates psychophysiological benefits associated with a more positive self-view. Physiological responses to our self-compassion exercise could be useful markers of treatment-related changes and further mechanism research on depressive relapse prevention.

        "abstract": "Cognitive abilities such as attention, memory, processing time, perception, and reasoning can be augmented using some type of intervention. Within the broad range of conventional and unconventional intervention methods used in cognitive enhancement, meditation is one of those that is safe, widely practiced by many since ancient times, and has been shown to reduce stress and improve psychological health and cognitive functioning. Various neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown functional and structural changes due to meditation in different types of meditation practices and on various groups of meditators. Recently, a few studies on meditation have used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study the effects of meditation on cerebral hemodynamics. In this study, we examined the short-term effects of loving-kindness (LK) meditation on sustained attention using behavioral performance measures, physiological outcomes, and cognitive activity as measured by fNIRS in first-time meditators during Stroop color word task (SCWT) performance. Our results indicated that behavioral outcomes, assessed mainly on response time (RT) during SCWT performance, showed a significant decrease after meditation. As expected, physiological measures, primarily pulse pressure (PP) measured after meditation dropped significantly as compared to the before meditation measurement. For the hemodynamic measures of oxygenated-hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxygenated-hemoglobin (Hb), and total-hemoglobin (HbT), our findings show significant differences in SCWT performance before and after meditation. Our results suggest that LK meditation can result in improvements in cognitive, physiological, and behavioral outcomes of first-time meditators after a short-term session. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Mindfulness-based interventions are effective for addictions like alcohol-dependence but its well-being outcomes should be validated empirically. Objectives: Current pilot study intended to explore the feasibility of a novel intervention, Mindfulness-Based Eudaimonic Enhancement Training (MEET), among individuals undergoing treatment for alcohol-dependence at an Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts (IRCA), Kerala, India. Methods: The experimental group (N=12) was administered with the intervention and Treatment as Usual (TaU) while the control group (N=12) received TaU alone. Obtained data were analysed using independent sample t-test and paired sample t-test. Results: After intervention the experimental group had reported better mindfulness, eudaimonic well-being, hedonic well-being, and flourishing. The results delineate the efficacy of the intervention as a mindfulness-based positive psychology intervention that enhances well-being and flourishing. Conclusion: This is the first study reporting the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention aimed exclusively at eudaimonic enhancement that showed promising impact among individuals with alcohol-dependence. The study contributes to the existing scientific literature, on the role of well-being and its enhancement for the effective treatment of addiction and relapse prevention.

        "abstract": "Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disabilities (IDs) can be stressful for many parents. Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) is a customized mindfulness program that enables parents and other caregivers to reduce their perceived psychological stress to normative levels through mindfulness procedures and to support children with ASD or ID to self-manage their challenging behaviors through positive behavior support (PBS). In this study, we evaluated whether MBPBS would have differential effects on the stress levels of mothers of adolescents with ASD (n = 47) or with ID (n = 45) and the effects of the program on the aggressive, disruptive, and compliance behaviors of their children. Both groups of mothers participated in the 40-week study (10 weeks control and 30 weeks MBPBS program), rated their own stress levels, and collected daily observational data on the adolescents' behavior. Results showed significant reductions in the level of stress in both groups of mothers, but no differential effects on mothers of children with ASD or with ID. In addition, significant reductions in aggression and disruptive behavior and increases in compliance behaviors were observed in the adolescents in both groups. The results suggest that MBPBS is equally beneficial for mothers of adolescents with ASD or ID. In the present study, although the mothers of children with ID had slightly higher levels of stress at baseline and mothers of children with ASD had lower levels of stress following the MBPBS program, the program can be considered equally effective in reducing the stress levels of both groups of mothers. This suggests that the program may be effective regardless of baseline levels of mothers' stress. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

To tackle this question, we collected 55 microphenomenological interviews (MpIs) reflecting subjective experiences during LKM. Furthermore, we obtained psychological and biological (oxytocin, cortisol) inter-individual difference measures during a nine-month, longitudinal, mental training study. LKM was predominantly described in positive affective terms and associated with cortisol decrease in accordance with the natural diurnal decline, which reflects its generally non-stressful nature. However, five participants reported experiences such as panic, sadness, and fear. Emotional challenge, as indicated by negative word use during MpIs, was linked to lower scores of self-kindness and higher scores of self-compassionate mindfulness.

        "abstract": "Objectives: Social approach and avoidance goals-which refer to individual differences in the desire to pursue rewards versus avoid negative experiences in social relationships-have numerous implications for the health and quality of social relationships. Although endorsement of these goals largely arises from people's pre-dispositions towards approach and avoidance, in this research, we proposed that meditation training has the potential to beneficially influence the extent to which people adopt approach and avoidance goals. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals who were randomly assigned to receive training in mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation would report differences in social approach and avoidance goals, as compared with those in a wait-list control condition, and that these effects would be mediated by differences in positive and negative emotions. Methods: To examine these hypotheses, we drew upon a community-based, randomized intervention study of 138 midlife adults, who were assigned to receive mindfulness training, loving-kindness training, or no training in meditation. Results: As compared with the control condition, results demonstrated that loving-kindness training was directly associated with lower social avoidance goals, and indirectly associated with greater social approach goals, via enhanced positive emotion. Conclusions: These results suggest loving-kindness meditation is a means by which people can beneficially influence their approach and avoidance tendencies, which likely plays an important role in enhancing their social relationships.

Nod has been adapted for use by college students who are on campus, virtual, or both by offering options for challenges that include both virtual and safe in-person connections. In 2019, a randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of Nod with 221 students entering their first year of college. The results suggest that Nod use buffered students from increased loneliness and related problems adjusting to college. +Connect is a 6-week smartphone intervention that uses a strength-based positive psychology framework targeting loneliness severity in young people.

        "abstract": "Previous studies have found that gifted children experience symptoms such as existential anguish, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion. The inherent intensity and sensitivity of these young people may make them more susceptible to significant emotional distress and existential concerns. Endeavoring to address such issues, we designed a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, called the 'Atencion plena para altas capacidades' (APAC; Mindfulness for Giftedness). This paper presents the pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up findings on the implementation of the program in a sample of 22 gifted children in Spain. The program comprised eight weekly 90-min group sessions covering mindfulness, emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, acceptance, values, compassion, and self-compassion. The program's efficacy was measured using standardized, validated tools (the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the Children's Depression Inventory, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children, and the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire) at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up time periods.. Our study's findings at the posttreatment stage suggested that the APAC program improved the emotional abilities and reduced negative symptoms. Results from the 12-month follow-up assessment stage appeared to uphold these findings. However, we recommend that future second-generation mindfulness-based interventions for gifted children should include more activities and exercises that address the meaning of life and other related existential worries of particular concern to these young people.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to uncover the day-to-day emotional profiles and dose-response relations, both within persons and between persons, associated with initiating one of two meditation practices, either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation. Data were pooled across two studies of midlife adults (N = 339) who were randomized to learn either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation in a 6-week workshop. The duration and frequency of meditation practice was measured daily for 9 weeks, commencing with the first workshop session. Likewise, positive and negative emotions were also measured daily, using the modified Differential Emotions Scale (Fredrickson, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 47:1-53, 2013). Analysis of daily emotion reports over the targeted 9-week period showed significant gains in positive emotions and no change in negative emotions, regardless of meditation type. Multilevel models also revealed significant dose-response relations between duration of meditation practice and positive emotions, both within persons and between persons. Moreover, the within-person dose-response relation was stronger for loving-kindness meditation than for mindfulness meditation. Similar dose-response relations were observed for the frequency of meditation practice. In the context of prior research on the mental and physical health benefits produced by subtle increases in day-to-day experiences of positive emotions, the present research points to evidence-based practices-both mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation-that can improve emotional well-being.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the structural brain changes due to the practice by examining volume, density, or cortical thickness changes. However, these studies have focused on adults; meditation's structural effects on the adolescent brain remain understudied. In this study, we investigated how meditation training affects the structure of the adolescent brain by scanning a group of 38 adolescents (16.48 \u00b1 1.29 years) before and after participating in a 12-week meditation training. Subjects underwent Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA), a program that mainly incorporates elements from mindfulness meditation and yoga-based practices. A subset of the adolescents also received an additional control scan 12 weeks before TARA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess gray matter volume changes pre- to post-training and during the control period. Subjects showed significant gray matter (GM) volume decreases in the left posterior insula and to a lesser extent in the left thalamus and left putamen after meditation training. There were no significant changes during the control period. Our results support previous findings that meditation affects regions associated with physical and emotional awareness. However, our results are different from previous morphometric studies in which meditation was associated with structural increases. We posit that this discrepancy may be due to the differences between the adolescent brain and the adult brain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

Study 1a was a longitudinal field experiment at a US insurance company. Compared to workers under waitlist control, employees who were assigned to a daily mindfulness training reported more helping behaviors over a five day period both in quantitative surveys and qualitative daily diaries. Study 1b, conducted in a large consulting company in India, extends these findings with a field experiment in which co-workers rated the prosocial behavior of teammates in a round robin design. Moving from devoting time to devoting money, in Studies 2a and 2b we find that individuals randomly assigned to engage in a focused breathing meditation were more financially generous. To understand the mechanisms of mindfulness' effects on prosocial behavior, Study 3 found support for empathy and moderate support for perspective taking as mediators. This study also examined the effects of induced state mindfulness via two different mindfulness inductions, focused breathing and loving kindness meditation. Our results indicate that secular state mindfulness can make people more other-oriented and helpful.

        "abstract": "Objective: This project investigated same-day and lagged (i.e., from one day to the next) associations between daily positive affect and three distinct positive health behaviours: physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and meditation. Cross-day analyses also examined the role of positive affect felt during the targeted health behaviours. Design: Secondary data analyses used a 9-week daily diary study in which midlife adults (N = 217) were randomized to learn one of two contemplative practices (i.e., mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation) while reporting nightly on their emotions and health behaviours. Results: Results of same-day analyses revealed positive associations, both between-person and within-person, for the three positive health behaviours with daily positive affect. Results of lagged analyses revealed that positive affect experienced during fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day fruit and vegetable intake, and that fruit and vegetable intake on a given day predicted next-day positive affect. Conclusion: The observed same-day relations between daily positive affect and engagement in positive health behaviours illuminate one path through which positive affect may contribute to health. The observed cross-day relations reveal a need for interdisciplinary research on mechanisms through which fruit and vegetable intake may shape next-day positive affect.

        "abstract": "Recent studies showed mixed findings regarding the sustainability of the effects of mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation interventions. This study, conducted on a sample of 128 management students divided into treatment and control groups, is the first that examines the long-term effects of the training in relational mindfulness. We focus on Relational Mindfulness Training (RMT), an 8-week intervention designed to help participants to be more present, aware, and kind towards themselves and others during social interactions. The results show a significant long-term impact of RMT on self-compassion, perceived stress and mindfulness. The impact of RMT on compassion and subjective happiness was significant in the short run, but only marginally significant in the long run for compassion and non-significant for subjective happiness. Furthermore, individuals who maintained an individual practice in the follow-up period showed notably better results concerning all examined effects, except compassion. The results suggest that the development of compassion is more dependent on the context of a training group. We provide recommendations for future interventions in order that they can make a more sustainable impact on compassion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "Mainstream mindfulness programs, as in first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, generally do not incorporate Buddhist ethics, causing some scholars to worry that they may encourage self-indulgence and have limited capacity to promote well-being. We compare the effects of practicing mindfulness with additional ethical instruction (EthicalM) or without such instruction (SecularM) on well-being and prosocial behavior. Participants (N = 621) completed 6 days of ethical or secular mindfulness exercises or active control exercises. Secular and ethical mindfulness both reduced stress (EthicalM: p = 0.011, d = -0.25; SecularM: p = 0.005, d = -0.28) and increased life satisfaction (EthicalM: p = 0.008, d = 0.26; SecularM: p = 0.069, d = 0.18) and self-awareness (EthicalM: p = 0.011, d = 0.25; SecularM: p = 0.051, d = 0.19). Ethical mindfulness also enhanced personal growth (p = 0.032, d = 0.21). Ethical, relative to secular, mindfulness also increased prosocial behavior-money donated to a charity (p = 0.020, d = 0.24). This effect was moderated by trait empathy: Trait empathy predicted donation amounts for participants who had completed mindfulness exercises (ethical or secular) but not controls. Furthermore, low trait empathy participants gave significantly less money following secular mindfulness practice than control exercises, whereas high trait empathy participants gave more money following ethical mindfulness practice than control exercises. Mindfulness training may thus have unintended consequences, making some people less charitable, though incorporating instruction on ethics, as in some second-generation mindfulness-based interventions, may forestall such effects.

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex and poorly understood psychosomatic pain disorder. The illness has been the subject of controversy, both in terms of the alleged lack of interest and capability of the medical community to understand and support patients with FMS, and the burden that such individuals place upon economic and healthcare resources. Due to the lack of convincing data for the effectiveness of extant pharmacological and non-pharmacological FMS treatments, a recent direction in FMS research has been the empirical investigation of mindfulness and other meditation-based approaches. The present qualitative study explored whether following participation in a mindfulness-based intervention, patients with FMS report experiencing changes in (i) how they experience and relate to their illness and (ii) their attitudes towards societal participation, work and unemployment. Ten individuals with FMS were randomly selected from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) for the treatment of FMS. Transcripts of semi-structured interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, a robust and rigorous qualitative methodology for analysing subjective experiences. Five super-ordinate themes emerged from the dataset: (i) reservations about participating, (ii) improvements in psychosomatic well-being, (iii) spiritual growth, (iv) awareness of impermanence and (v) increased sense of citizenship. MAT was experienced as both an acceptable and accessible intervention by individuals with FMS, and participants reported experiencing improvements in psychosocial functioning as well as an increased sense of societal responsibility. MAT appears to have utility for treating FMS and for changing the attitudes of some individuals with FMS towards community engagement and societal contribution.

        "abstract": "The relationship between positive emotions and implicit racial prejudice is unclear. Interventions using positive emotions to reduce racial bias have been found wanting, while other research shows that positive affect can sometimes exacerbate implicit prejudice. Nevertheless, loving-kindness meditation (LKM) has shown some promise as a method of reducing bias despite increasing a broad range of positive emotions. A randomised control trial (n = 69) showed that a short-term induction of LKM decreased automatic processing, increased controlled processing, and was sufficient to reduce implicit prejudice towards the target's racial group but not towards a group untargeted by the meditation. Furthermore, the reduction in bias was shown to be mediated by other-regarding positive emotions alongside increased control and decreased automaticity on the IAT. Non-other-regarding positive emotions conversely showed no correlation with bias. The study is the first to show that a short-term positive emotional induction can reduce racial prejudice, and aids the understanding of how positive emotions functionally differentiate in affecting bias.

        "abstract": "Objectives: Mindfulness-based approaches to meditation usually rely on not one but several specific techniques or elements, but what elements are responsible for which of the commonly found positive effects is not yet known. To help answer this question, we compared the effects of three different meditation techniques that are commonly used in mindfulness-based approaches. Methods: Fifty-six students with no prior meditation experience participated in a breathing, body scan, or loving-kindness meditation condition. Participants followed meditation instructions that they were given on audio files, for daily practice and weekly meetings over a period of 6 weeks. Dependent variables were mindfulness, concentration, self-compassion, emotional regulation and experience, and life satisfaction. Results: The body scan meditation condition reported greater effects on almost all dependent variables than those in the breathing meditation condition with effect sizes from beta = .16 to .61. The group showed the highest increase in the mindfulness dimension acceptance but not presence. Loving-kindness meditation showed higher effect sizes in concentration than the breathing meditation group. Conclusions: Specific meditation techniques may have effects other than expected on psychological variables. Considering the limitations of this study, further research is needed to assess the specific effects of single mindfulness techniques. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing number of young adults living at home with their parents, and this can lead to tension and conflict in the family home. One way to help increase the pro-social interactions and connectedness between young adults and their parents is with using Loving-Kindness Meditations (LKM). There is considerable evidence suggesting that LKM, which is a cultivation of good-will for self and others, can have many direct benefits on psychological distress and interpersonal interactions, and can indirectly increase self-compassion. This study examined the effects of using a 15-min Loving-Kindness Meditation for young adults living. A total of 97 participants (79 female, mean age = 18.64 years), were randomly allocated to LKM or a Focused Imagery control. Participants completed measures examining self-compassion, compassion motivation, and emotional, cognitive and interpersonal responses to vignettes describing conflict between young adults and their parents. As predicted, compared to controls, young adults who received LKM were higher in motivation to be self-compassionate, however, there was no difference in levels of self-compassion. Initial fear of self-compassion influenced emotional responses on the vignettes. The findings suggest that self-compassion could assist young adults in managing their own internal distress when interacting with their parents.

        "abstract": "Research in social neuroscience provides increasing evidence that self and other are interconnected, both on a conceptual and on an affective representational level. Moreover, the ability to recognize the other as 'like the self' is thought to be essential for social phenomena like empathy and compassion. Meditation practices such as loving-kindness meditation (LKM) have been found to enhance these capacities. Therefore, we investigated whether LKM is associated to an increased integration of self-other-representations. As an indicator, we assessed the P300 event-related potential elicited by oddball stimuli of the self-face and a close other's face in 12 long-term practitioners of LKM and 12 matched controls. In line with previous studies, the self elicited larger P300 amplitudes than close other. This effect was reduced in the meditation sample at parietal but not frontal midline sites. Within this group, smaller differences between self- and other-related P300 were associated with increasing meditation practice. Across groups, smaller P300 differences correlated with self-reported compassion. In meditators, we also investigated the effect of a short LKM compared to a control priming procedure in order to test whether the state induction would additionally modulate self- vs. other -related P300. However, no effect of the priming conditions was observed. Overall, our findings provide preliminary evidence that prolonged meditation practice may modulate self- vs. other-related processing, accompanied by an increase in compassion. Further evidence is needed, however, to show if this is a direct outcome of loving-kindness meditation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

Some college students with PTSD symptoms may use alcohol and other substances to cope with their symptoms, and those with PTSD experience more negative alcohol and drug consequences than those without PTSD. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been successfully utilized for individuals with PTSD or substance use disorders. However, to date, no studies have evaluated MBIs for college students with co-occurring PTSD symptoms and problem drinking. This study was a feasibility pilot of a 4-week group loving-kindness meditation (LKM) intervention, a practice of intentionally directing well wishes to oneself and others. LKM was compared to referral to treatment as usual (RTAU) for non-treatment seeking college students (N = 75) with PTSD symptoms and problem drinking. Overall, the LKM group had low to moderate feasibility and acceptability among college students, as recruitment was lower than expected and attendance at LKM groups was modest. Participants' PTSD symptoms, drinking quantity, and negative drinking consequences decreased, and state mindfulness increased over the course of the study, but there were no significant differences between LKM and RTAU on these outcomes. Additionally, higher coping drinking motives predicted greater PTSD symptoms and more drinking consequences over the course of the study. Effective interventions for college students with PTSD symptoms and problematic alcohol use are needed, especially for individuals who drink to cope with their PTSD symptoms. Future research on LKM that addresses the limitations of the current study is warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

Previous studies have reported common difficulties during the practice of the FIM, yet there is no specific measure for those difficulties. The current study intended to develop the Difficulties during Meditation involving Immeasurable Attitudes Scale (DMIAS) to measure two aspects of common difficulties during the FIM practice: lack of concentration (LOC) and lack of pro-social attitudes (LOP). A total of 506 meditation novices were used in four studies. In study 1, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with the data from a one-time practice of loving-kindness meditation was used to produce the 12-item DMIAS with two independent factors that were positively correlated (LOC and LOP). Studies 2, 3, and 4 validated the DMIAS in one-time practices of loving-kindness meditation, appreciative joy meditation, and compassion meditation, respectively. Across studies 2 to 4, confirmatory factor analyses supported the two-factor structure of the DMIAS, and both LOP and LOC had negative correlations with the other-focused positive emotions generated by the meditations. Although manipulations of the target to be blessed (study 3) and the length of practice (study 4) only had small impacts on the effects of meditation, the pattern of correlations between emotional outcomes and certain factors of the DMIAS was significantly different between the manipulated conditions. In summary, the DMIAS is a useful tool in understanding the difficulties during the FIM practice, and the current study also illustrated how technical details of the FIM influences the effects of the FIM practice.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-46263-001[/rid]). Objectives People raised in low-socioeconomic status (SES) households are at an increased risk for physical illness in adulthood. A shift in gene expression profiles in the immune system is one biological mechanism thought to account for elevated disease susceptibility, with a frequently investigated profile being the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral and antibody-related genes. Methods The present study investigated, in a sample of at-risk midlife adults (N = 88), whether those randomized to learn loving-kindness meditation (LKM) in a 6-week workshop would show a reduction in CTRA gene expression, compared to those randomized to learn mindfulness meditation (MM). We assessed emotions daily and hypothesized positive emotions to account for the expected effect of LKM on gene expression. Results Results showed significant group differences from pre- to post-intervention, yet in the opposite direction as hypothesized: Participants randomized to the MM group showed significant declines in CTRA gene expression, whereas those in the LKM group showed significant increases in CTRA gene expression. Both groups showed increases over the 6 weeks in daily reports of positive emotions (b = .007, p < .001) alongside decreases in negative emotions (b = - .005, p < .001). Thus, positive emotions were not pursued as a candidate mediator of observed group effects. Conclusions This study is the first to examine whether the biological impact of childhood low SES can be reversed in midlife through meditation interventions. Results suggest mindfulness meditation may be a viable option for improving health outcomes in this at-risk population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

In this study, undergraduate students (n = 104) were randomized to a single-session practice of MM, LKM, or reading control and completed self-report measures of decentering and positive affect directed toward self and other. Participants also completed an experimental measure of valenced SRP-ORP. Practice of both meditations was associated with increased decentering and positive affect relative to reading control, although self-reported response to MM and LKM did not significantly differ. Following the meditation, whereas participants randomized to MM evidenced an expected self-positivity bias in positive affective response and reaction time during an experimental SRP-ORP task, participants randomized to LKM did not. LKM, as uniquely involving the intentional cultivation of positive emotion toward both self and other, may be associated with a relative normalization of the self-positivity bias. Individual differences in response to SRP-ORP were also examined as a function of traits related to mindfulness and loving-kindness, in addition to as a function of variability in experiential response to MM and LKM.

        "abstract": "Some parents have to deal with the challenging behaviors of their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including aggressive and destructive behaviors. While pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been the treatments of choice, sometimes the pharmacological treatments are not very effective or the behavioral interventions are so labor intensive that parents fail to implement them consistently, thus leading to treatment failure and parental stress. In this proof-of-concept study, we assessed the effects of providing mindfulness-based positive behavior support (MBPBS) training to three mothers on the challenging and compliance behaviors of their adolescents with ASD. The MBPBS program included a series of meditations aimed at personal transformation during an 8-week program. The training in mindfulness-based practices was paired with applications to their interactions with their adolescent children using a positive behavior support model, whereby the mothers learned how to apply behavioral contingencies with intuitive awareness. Results showed that the adolescents' challenging behaviors decreased and compliance behaviors increased commensurate with the mothers' training in MBPBS. In addition, statistically significant reductions in the mothers' stress levels were correlated with the MBPBS training. These findings provide initial support for MBPBS in assisting parents to effectively manage the challenging behaviors of their children with ASD and in increasing their positive social interactions with them, but without raising their own stress levels.

Whether informal meditation practice improves well-being is unclear. The purpose of this investigation was to test hypotheses about the day-to-day socioemotional profiles and dose-response relations, both within persons and between persons, associated with informal meditation practice. Methods: Midlife adults (N = 231), new to meditation, were randomized to learn either mindfulness meditation or loving-kindness meditation in a 6-week workshop that taught both formal and informal meditation practices. The frequency of informal meditation practice was measured daily for 9 weeks. Likewise, formal meditation, emotions, and perceptions of social integration were also measured daily. Results: Multilevel models of daily reports over a 9-week period revealed significant dose-response relations between the frequency of informal meditation and positive emotions and perceived social integration-both within persons and between persons (positive emotions: within-person b = 0.05, 95% CI [0.03, 0.07], between-person b = 0.35, 95% CI [0.20, 0.51]; social integration: within-person b = 0.11, 95% CI [0.07, 0.14], between-person b = 0.41, 95% CI [0.12, 0.70]). Effects were comparable for the distinct informal practices of mindfulness and loving-kindness, and were statistically independent of the effects of formal meditation practice. Conclusions: The present research demonstrated that, distinct from formal meditation practice, informal meditation practice is linked to both positive emotions and social integration in a dose-response manner.

Sixty-one participants (65.6% female, Mage = 44.5; 34.4% male, Mage = 54.3) attended an 8-week program whose curriculum included the commitment to and practices of ethical and compassionate behaviors that reflected participants' personal values. The impact of MBSM on mindfulness (Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), congruence between ideal values and their lived experience of those values (Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire (SWBQ)), and relationships between mindfulness and value incongruence were examined. Results indicated that increases in all of the FFMQ factors occurred: Observe (p < .001, d = .52), Describe (p < .01, d = .39), Act with Awareness (p < .001; d = .68), Non-judgment (p < 001, d = .67), and Non-reactivity (p < .001, d = .64).

        "abstract": "While meditation has drawn much attention in cognitive neuroscience, the neural mechanisms underlying its emotional processing remains elusive. Sant Mat meditators were recruited, who adopt a loving-kindness mode of meditation along with a vegetarian diet and an alcohol-restricted lifestyle and novices. We assessed their State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and scanned their amygdala reactivity in response to an explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of fearful and happy faces. In contrast with novices, meditators reported lower STAI scores. Meditators showed stronger amygdala reactivity to explicit happiness than to fear, whereas novices exhibited the opposite pattern. The amygdala reactivity was reduced in meditators regardless of implicit fear or happiness. Those who had more lifetime practice in meditation reported lower STAI and showed a weaker amygdala response to fear. Furthermore, the amygdala in meditators, relative to novices, had a stronger positive functional connectivity with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explicit happiness, but a more negative connectivity with the insula and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to explicit fear. Mediation analysis indicated the amygdala reactivity as the mediator for the linkage between meditation experience and trait anxiety. The findings demonstrate the neural correlates that underpin the beneficial effects of meditation in Sant Mat. Long-term meditation could be functionally coupled with the amygdala reactivity to explicit and implicit emotional processing, which would help reduce anxiety and potentially enhance well-being.

        "abstract": "Mindfulness has been practiced in the Eastern world for over twenty-five centuries but has only recently become popular in the West. Today, interventions such as 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy' are used within the Western health setting and have proven to be successful techniques for reducing psychological distress. However, a limitation of such interventions is that they tend to apply the practices of mindfulness in an 'out of context' manner. To overcome this, a newly formed Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) program focusses on the establishment of solid meditative foundations and integrates various support practices that are traditionally assumed to effectuate a more sustainable quality of well-being. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of MAT for improving psychological well-being in a sub-clinical sample of higher education students with issues of stress, anxiety, and low mood. Utilizing a controlled design, participants of the study (n = 14) undertook an 8-week MAT program and comparisons were made with a control group (n = 11) on measures of self-assessed psychological well-being (emotional distress, positive affect, and negative affect) and dispositional mindfulness. Participants who received MAT showed significant improvements in psychological well-being and dispositional mindfulness over controls. MAT may increase emotion regulation ability in higher education students with issues of stress, anxiety, and low mood. Individuals receiving training in mindfulness meditation may benefit by engendering a broader, more ethically informed, and compassionate intention for their mindfulness practice.

        "title": "Heart of joy: A randomized controlled trail evaluating the effect of an appreciative joy meditation training on subjective well-being and attitudes",
        "abstract": "Many studies support the beneficial effects of the 'four immeasurable meditations' (FIM) that originate from Buddhism, but most psychological interventions adopt FIM that cultivate loving-kindness and compassion. The current study developed and evaluated a 4-week training program named 'Heart of Joy' (HOJ) that is based on FIM that cultivate appreciative joy. Participants were randomly assigned to HOJ training (n = 59) or a wait-list condition (n = 42), and the final sample consisted of 41 participants in each condition. Satisfaction with life, appreciative joy, envy, emotions, and attitudes toward oneself and others were measured at pre-training, at post-training, and at a 1-month follow-up. The time * condition (M)ANOVA showed that HOJ participants had significantly higher low-arousal positive emotions and lower high-arousal and low-arousal negative emotions at both the post-training and follow-up assessments, as well as higher medium-arousal positive emotions at the post-training assessment only. HOJ participants also reported significantly higher life satisfaction at both the post-training and follow-up assessments and significantly lower envy at the follow-up assessment. The results had a medium effect size (Cohen's d values ranging from 0.52 to 0.69). Appreciative joy, all attitudes, high-arousal positive emotions, and medium-arousal negative emotions did not show significant results. Further investigations revealed that changes in appreciative joy were more closely associated with changes in high-arousal than low-arousal positive emotions, and changes in envy were more closely associated with changes in attitudes toward oneself than attitudes toward others; this outcome indicates that appreciative joy and envy were impacted during this intervention. This study suggests that HOJ is a promising training program to improve subjective well-being and envy, and the implications for research were discussed.

        "abstract": "While mindfulness meditation has been associated with enhanced attentional abilities, the consequences of loving-kindness meditation for attention have not previously been investigated. We examined the trait and state effects of 8 weeks of training in loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on the attentional blink. The attentional blink is a period of time in which a target stimulus is less likely to be detected if it follows too quickly (approximately 500 ms) after a previously detected target. For the two experiments reported here, a group of participants trained in LKM by meditating for approximately 15 min per day, four days per week, for 8 weeks. Experiment 1 utilized a pre-post design, with a non-meditating control group, to examine whether this training reduced the attentional blink. No differences were found. However, in an exploratory analysis, meditators did exhibit increases in two facets of mindfulness measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire: observation and descriptiveness. In experiment 2, we tested for a state effect of LKM by having trained meditators practice LKM immediately prior to the attentional blink task. Here, meditators had a significantly reduced blink size compared to control participants. To establish that this reduction was caused by the combination of LKM training with pre-task meditation, we analyzed the data in experiment 2 with respect to one of our previous works, which reported that the practice of LKM immediately prior to the attentional blink task in those without meditation training did not reduce the blink magnitude. This analysis also revealed a significant difference. Therefore, training in LKM, coupled with its practice immediately prior to an attention task, caused a state reduction in the attentional blink. These results are the first to demonstrate that LKM, an emotion-focused practice, influences cognitive processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "While many studies have shown that meditation enhances attentional processing, very few studies have investigated the effect of enhanced attentional processing on visual awareness. We investigate the attentional effects on visual awareness in focused attention meditators using a task that manipulates scope of attention using hierarchical letter stimuli (local and global processing) and single letter stimuli of varying size (small and large). In addition, working memory load was manipulated using a 0-back and 2-back task. Data were collected from Sahaj Samadhi Meditators and an age-matched control group of non-meditators. Visual awareness was tapped using negative color afterimages by measuring the duration and more importantly the clarity and color of afterimages using a rating scale. The afterimage durations were significantly longer for Sahaj Samadhi meditators compared to non-meditators. In addition, the afterimages were sharper for meditators compared to non-meditators suggesting that better attentional focusing associated with meditators might lead to phenomenal changes in visual awareness. Scope of attention influenced not only afterimage durations but also clarity indicating that changes in scope also influence aspects of visual awareness. The results indicate meditation training not only modifies attentional processes but also results in changes in conscious visual perception.

        "abstract": "Appreciative joy (or sympathetic joy) refers to feeling happiness for others and is one of the four prosocial attitudes ('four immeasurables') cultivated by loving-kindness meditation in Buddhism. The current study included 1622 participants and developed a scale to measure appreciative joy for friends in daily life. Both an exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in an appreciative joy scale consisting of three components: sense of joy, positive interpersonal bias, and self-transcendence (study 1). The appreciative joy scale exhibited high correlations with measurements for interpersonal relationships and four immeasurables. The scale also shows incremental contributions to positive emotions, satisfaction with life, trait happiness, and peace of mind after controlling for interpersonal relationships or the four immeasurables (studies 2 and 3). The scale exhibited higher scores among Buddhists than among individuals with no religious belief, and its structure was maintained across English and Chinese samples (study 4); in addition, it demonstrated good test-retest reliability (study 5). Overall, the current study validated the scale as a useful tool for measuring appreciative joy, and certain findings also highlighted directions for future research on appreciative joy, including causal relationships with positive emotions, comparisons with compassion, and effects on envy.

        "abstract": "Importance: Loneliness is a risk factor for depression and other illnesses and may be caused and reinforced by maladaptive social cognition. Secularized classical meditation training programs address social cognition, but practice typically occurs alone. Little is known about the effectiveness of contemplative practice performed in dyads. Objective: To introduce and assess the effectiveness of contemplative dyadic practices relative to classical-solitary meditation with regard to engagement and perceived social connectedness. Design, Setting, and Participants: The ReSource Project was a 9-month open-label efficacy trial of three, 3-month secularized mental training modules. Replacement randomization was used to assign 362 healthy participants in Leipzig and Berlin, Germany. Eligible participants were recruited between November 11, 2012, and February 13, 2013, and between November 13, 2013, and April 30, 2014. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Interventions: Breathing meditation and body scan (the presence module), loving-kindness meditation and affect dyad (the affect module), and observing-thoughts meditation and perspective dyad (the perspective module). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were self-disclosure and social closeness. Engagement measures included compliance (ie, the mean [95% margin of error] number of meditation sessions that a participant engaged in per week), liking, and motivation to practice. Results: Thirty participants dropped out after assignment to 3 experimental groups; 90 participants were assigned to a retest control that did not complete the main outcome measures; 16 participants provided no state-change data for the affect and perspective modules (226 remaining participants; mean age of 41.15 years; 59.3% female). Results are aggregated across training cohorts. Compliance was similar across the modules: loving-kindness meditation (3.78 [0.18] sessions), affect dyad (3.59 [0.14] sessions), observing-thoughts meditation (3.63 [0.20] sessions), and perspective dyad (3.24 [0.18] sessions). Motivation was higher for meditation (11.20 [0.40] sessions) than the dyads (9.26 [0.43] sessions) and was higher for the affect dyad (10.11 [0.46] sessions) than the perspective dyad (8.41 [0.46] sessions). Social closeness increased during a session for the affect dyad (1.49 [0.12] sessions) and the perspective dyad (1.06 [0.12] sessions) and increased over time for the affect dyad (slope of 0.016 [0.003]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 0.012 [0.003]). Self-disclosure increased over time for the affect dyad (slope of 0.023 [0.004]) and the perspective dyad (slope of 0.006 [0.005]), increasing more steeply for the affect dyad (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Contemplative dyads elicited engagement similar to classical contemplative practices and increased perceived social connectedness. Contemplative dyads represent a new type of intervention targeting social connectedness and intersubjective capacities deficient in participants who experience loneliness and in many psychopathologies.

In the original article, the colors identifying 'Breathing meditation' and 'Body Scan' were unfortunately switched in the figure relative to the legend. The correct Figure 2 is provided in the erratum.] Despite increasing interest in the effects of mental training practices such as meditation, there is much ambiguity regarding whether and to what extent the various types of mental practice have differential effects on psychological change. To address this gap, we compare the effects of four common meditation practices on measures of state change in affect, mind-wandering, meta-cognition, and interoception. In the context of a 9-month mental training program called the ReSource Project, 229 mid-life adults (mean age 41) provided daily reports before and after meditation practice. Participants received training in the following three successive modules: the first module (presence) included breathing meditation and body scan, the second (affect) included loving-kindness meditation, and the third (perspective) included observing-thought meditation. Using multilevel modeling, we found that body scan led to the greatest state increase in interoceptive awareness and the greatest decrease in thought content, loving-kindness meditation led to the greatest increase in feelings of warmth and positive thoughts about others, and observing-thought meditation led to the greatest increase in meta-cognitive awareness. All practices, including breathing meditation, increased positivity of affect, energy, and present focus and decreased thought distraction. Complementary network analysis of intervariate relationships revealed distinct phenomenological clusters of psychological change congruent with the content of each practice. These findings together suggest that although different meditation practices may have common beneficial effects, each practice can also be characterized by a distinct short-term psychological fingerprint, the latter having important implications for the use of meditative practices in different intervention contexts and with different populations.

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex psychosomatic pain condition. In addition to generalized pain and various cognitive difficulties, new FMS diagnostic criteria acknowledge fatigue and sleep problems as core aspects of this condition. Indeed, poor sleep quality has been found to be a significant predictor of pain, fatigue, and maladaptive social functioning in this patient group. While there is promising evidence supporting the role of mindfulness as a treatment for FMS, to date, mindfulness intervention studies have principally focused on dimensions of pain as the primary outcome with sleep problems either not being assessed or included as a secondary consideration. Given the role of sleep problems in the pathogenesis of FMS, and given that mindfulness has been shown to improve sleep problems in other clinical conditions, the present study explored the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention known as Flow Meditation (Meditacion-Fluir) on a range of sleep-related outcomes (subjective insomnia, sleep quality, sleepiness, and sleep impairment) in individuals with FMS. Adult women with FMS (n = 39) were randomly assigned to the 7 weeks mindfulness treatment or a waiting list control group. Results showed that compared to the control group, individuals in the mindfulness group demonstrated significant improvements across all outcome measures and that the intervention effects were maintained at a 3 month follow-up assessment. The Meditacion-Fluir program shows promise for alleviating sleep problems relating to FMS and may thus have a role in the treatment of FMS as well as other pain disorders in which sleep impairment is a central feature of the condition.

        "abstract": "High levels of worry are a common phenomenon in undergraduate populations, with 28 to 40% of undergraduates in introductory psychology courses classified as 'high worriers.' Worry is characterized by a pervasive neglect of the present moment and persistent thoughts about the future. Various methods of increasing present moment focus have been devised. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of two brief present moment awareness training paradigms-Mindfulness Meditation and Present Moment Joy-in high worriers. Although both paradigms seek to increase present moment awareness, the processes by which each does so are different and potentially contradictory. Prior studies have not compared these two paradigms, and the field has yet to examine Present Moment Joy as an independent technique. Ninety-seven high worriers completed two, 20-minute training sessions across 2 days of either Mindfulness Meditation or Present Moment Joy. Participants rated levels of state mindfulness (curiosity and decentering), affect, and anxiety before and after each session. Both conditions increased curiosity and decentering, but Mindfulness Meditation led to greater decentering changes on day 2 than did Present Moment Joy. Both conditions decreased anxiety and negative affect. Only Present Moment Joy increased positive affect. Results suggest that, although Mindfulness Meditation and Present Moment Joy operate via different mechanisms, both increase present moment awareness and reduce anxiety and negative affect; however, when one's goal is also to increase positive affect, Present Moment Joy may be the more effective intervention.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Adolescents are experiencing high rates of depressive symptoms, with negative consequences to their long-term health. Group-based, mindful self-compassion programs show promise in mitigating the development of more significant depression in at-risk adolescents. However, the lack of well-designed, active control conditions has limited the ability to examine the efficacy of such interventions. Methods: Fifty-nine adolescents (Mage = 15.81, 70% female) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms from the Southeastern US were randomized to group-based Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens (N = 30) or a newly developed active control Healthy Lifestyles group (N = 29) during 2018 and 2019. Participants attended 8 weekly \"main\" sessions followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. The feasibility and acceptability of participation in both groups were measured using attrition, attendance, credibility, and satisfaction data. Depression scores were collected weekly, and self-compassion scores were collected five times across 36 weeks. Results: Both groups were equally feasible and acceptable during the 8-week program period; however, monthly continuation sessions were poorly attended in both groups. The risk of developing clinically significant depression was 2.6 times higher in the control group compared with the self-compassion group (p =.037) across 36 weeks. Depression significantly decreased in the self-compassion group, while it significantly increased in the control group. Both groups increased significantly in reports of self-compassion. These findings are on par with results noting the efficacy of cognitive-based interventions for high-risk adolescents; follow-up studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to confirm these findings. Conclusions: Initial examination suggests Mindful Self-Compassion for Teens programming is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in preventing the development of clinically significant depression in adolescents with subsyndromal depression. Future studies may benefit from refinements to the self-compassion measurement and/or the attention control condition; moreover, larger sample sizes are needed to confirm results.

        "abstract": "Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

Mindful parenting (MP) is an emerging approach that brings mindful awareness to parent-child interactions and is found effective in reducing parenting stress in various parent populations. This study examined the effectivenesss of an 8-week online MP program on Chinese parents of children with LDs. A MP program was adapted and implemented in an online format with 69 parents of children with LDs. A randomized controlled trial design was used to examine the efficacy of the mindful parenting group compared with a wait-list control group. Parenting stress, mindful parenting and self-compassion were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Compared with the wait-list control group, the MP group participants showed decreased parenting stress (d = 0.62, p < 0.05), improved mindful parenting (d = 0.63, p < 0.05), and increased self-compassion (d = 0.61, p < 0.05). These findings support the effectiveness of an online MP intervention in reducing parenting stress and increasing mindful parenting and self-compassion among Chinese parents of children with LDs. The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, whereas the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects, particularly non-judgmental acceptance and compassion towards the child, are resistant to change. Future studies should explore strategies to enhance these attitudinal aspects and interpersonal processes of MP. - Mindful parenting (MP) program can reduce parenting stress, improve mindful parenting and enhance self-compassion in parents of children with learning disabilities. - Online MP interventions can provide comparable effectiveness to traditional formats for parents of children with clinical conditions. - The behavioral and intrapersonal aspects of MP are more amenable to improvement, compared with the attitudinal and interpersonal aspects.

The current study explored the impact of background music on the effects and difficulties of LKM practice. Two hundred participants were randomly divided into six groups, wherein LKM plus music with harmony only, LKM plus music with harmony and melody, and LKM without music were presented in a different order during the intermediate three days of a five-day LKM intervention. Participants reported three types of positive emotions (pro-social, low-arousal, and medium-arousal positive emotions) and the difficulties during meditation (lack of concentration and lack of pro-social attitudes) after each of three sessions. The results of MANOVA indicated that compared to the session without music, incorporating music could evoke more low-arousal positive emotions and pro-social positive emotions without altering the difficulties. However, the results did not reveal significant differences in the effects of music with harmony and music with harmony and melody on both emotions and difficulties. Additionally, practice effects may have influenced the generation of medium-arousal positive emotions and the difficulty of concentration, but the results were inconsistent across groups. Our findings suggest potential benefits for practitioners of LKM in incorporating music during the meditation process, and the directions for future research were further discussed.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to identify moderators of treatment effect (i.e. depressive symptoms and well-being) of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI) in patients with bipolar disorder. Data were drawn from two multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating effectiveness of MBCT vs treatment as usual (TAU; n = 144) and PPI vs TAU (n = 97) in bipolar disorder. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 12 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using separate linear regression models, comparing the pooled MBCT or PPI outcomes to TAU, and comparing MBCT to PPI. The exploratory analyses not corrected for multiple comparisons showed a number of variables that were associated with stronger response to the interventions, including higher baseline anxiety, lower well-being, and lower levels of self-focused positive rumination, well-being, and self-compassion, and variables associated with a stronger response to either MBCT (higher levels of depression and anxiety and being married) or PPI (being male). After correcting for multiple testing, depressive symptoms appeared to be the most robust variable associated with better response to MBCT than PPI. The RCTs handled slightly different enrollment criteria and outcome measures. The most robust finding is that patients with more severe symptomatology seem to benefit more from MBCT than PPI. This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. However, before definite treatment assignment criteria can be formulated and implemented in clinical practice, these findings should be replicated. - This is a first step to improve personalized assignment of third-wave CBT interventions for patients with bipolar disorder. - Findings show that both MBCT and PPI are more helpful than TAU in improving well-being at 12-months after baseline. - Patients with more severe symptomatology benefit more from MBCT than PPI at posttreatment and 12 months after baseline.

The primary outcome is the improvement in generic sense of ability to adapt as measured with the Generic Sense of Ability to Adapt Scale (GSAAS; (Front Psychol 14:985408, 2023)) at 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are mental well-being, (parental) distress, and client satisfaction with \"Adappt.\" Discussion: Results of this study will contribute to knowledge on the effectiveness of a low-threshold application for parents of children with a NDD in multiple countries. If the application is found to be effective in improving mental health, recommendations will be made for implementation in health care. Trial registration: This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06248762) on February 8, 2024, and the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/5znqv). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "<bold>Objectives: </bold>The purpose of this study was to conduct the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention (SG-MBI) for treating fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Compared to first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, SG-MBIs are more acknowledging of the spiritual aspect of mindfulness.<bold>Design: </bold>A RCT employing intent-to-treat analysis.<bold>Methods: </bold>Adults with FMS received an 8-week SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (MAT; n = 74) or an active control intervention known as cognitive behaviour theory for groups (n = 74). Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 6-month follow-up phases.<bold>Results: </bold>Meditation awareness training participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control group participants in FMS symptomatology, pain perception, sleep quality, psychological distress, non-attachment (to self, symptoms, and environment), and civic engagement. A mediation analysis found that (1) civic engagement partially mediated treatment effects for all outcome variables, (2) non-attachment partially mediated treatment effects for psychological distress and sleep quality, and (3) non-attachment almost fully mediated treatment effects for FMS symptomatology and pain perception. Average daily time spent in meditation was found to be a significant predictor of changes in all outcome variables.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Meditation awareness training may be a suitable treatment for adults with FMS and appears to ameliorate FMS symptomatology and pain perception by reducing attachment to self. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Designing interventions to treat fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) continues to be a challenge. There is growing interest into the applications of mindfulness-based interventions for treating FMS. Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) are a key new direction in mindfulness research. What does this study add? Meditation awareness training - an SG-MBI - resulted in significant reductions in FMS symptomatology. SG-MBIs recognize the spiritual aspect of mindfulness and may have a role in the treatment of FMS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Wanting to help others and benefit society in one's future career are examples of communal career goals. Raising these goals in youth should increase interest in HEED-occupations (Healthcare, Early Education, Domestic, and the Domestic fields) which are strongly gender-skewed and face labor shortage. Research has yet to find ways to increase communal career goals. In this study, we test the novel hypothesis that after listening to a brief loving-kindness meditation, participants will rate stronger communal career goals, as compared to controls. In three experimental studies, volunteering high-school students (Study 1 and 3) and university students (Study 2) listened to a 12-min recording of the meditation with the explicit purpose of investigating its effect on stress. They thereafter filled out an apparently unrelated career goal survey. We compared the results with a control group that just rated the career goals (Studies 1-3) and a control group that listened to calm music before filling out the survey (Study 2 and 3). The results showed that the high-school students rated higher communal career goals after listening to the meditation, as compared to controls. We did not replicate the result in the sample of university students, which could relate to adults having less flexible career goals than youth, or to a ceiling effect in communal goals. This is the first study that has demonstrated a method with the potential of increasing communal career goals in youth. In addition to increasing interest in HEED, raising communal goals could benefit society, since they are intrinsically prosocial. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Objective: Understanding the relevance of religion or spirituality (R/S) in the treatment of mental disorders is central to clinical and academic psychiatry. In this secondary analysis, associations of R/S with depression were investigated with respect to a new second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, the Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program. Methods: Different aspects of spirituality, spiritual coping, and spiritual engagement were assessed in 81 patients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate depression. Treatment effects on R/S postscores and predictor and moderation effects of depression severity and stress change-scores were evaluated at 8 weeks (MBLM vs. CONTROL [drug continuation therapy] vs. TAU [inpatient treatment as usual]) and 6 months (TAU+MBLM vs. TAU). Results: At both time points, significant differences between MBLM versus TAU and CONTROL were found in a range of spiritual outcomes, most of them with a medium-to-large effect size and in favor of MBLM. Baseline interest in spirituality (p = 0.001) and baseline spiritual mind-body practice (p = 0.017) were identified as independent predictors of change in depression severity at 6 months. Moreover, moderation analyses found that patients reporting often/regular spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months did not benefit differently from TAU+MBLM versus TAU (p = 0.437) regarding their change in depression severity and stress, while those reporting no/seldom spiritual mind-body practice at 6 months benefited significantly worse from TAU than from TAU+MBLM (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Participation in the MBLM program resulted in significantly greater increases in spirituality in depressed patients than standard therapy. Interest in spirituality and engagement in spiritual mind-body practices at baseline were positive predictors of clinical outcome in both groups. Patients of any group who regularly performed spiritual mind-body practices benefited equally in terms of antidepressant outcomes, underlining the benefit of these practices within a general therapeutic framework.

        "abstract": "<bold>Objective: </bold>Mood difficulties are common among patients with diabetes and are linked to poor blood glucose control and increased complications. Evidence on psychological treatments that improve both mood and metabolic outcomes is limited. Greater self-compassion predicts better mental and physical health in both healthy and chronically ill populations. Thus, the purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the effects of self-compassion training on mood and metabolic outcomes among patients with diabetes.<bold>Research Design and Methods: </bold>This RCT tested the effects of a standardized 8-week mindful self-compassion (MSC) program (n = 32) relative to a wait-list control condition (n = 31) among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Measures of self-compassion, depressive symptoms, diabetes-specific distress, and HbA1c were taken at baseline (preintervention), at week 8 (postintervention), and at 3-month follow-up.<bold>Results: </bold>Repeated-measures ANOVA using intention to treat showed that MSC training increased self-compassion and produced statistically and clinically significant reductions in depression and diabetes distress in the intervention group, with results maintained at 3-month follow-up.

        "abstract": "Objective: This is a randomized controlled trial (NCT03056157) of an enhanced adaptive disclosure (AD) psychotherapy compared to present-centered therapy (PCT; each 12 sessions) in 174 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to traumatic loss (TL) and moral injury (MI). AD employs different strategies for different trauma types. AD-Enhanced (AD-E) uses letter writing (e.g., to the deceased), loving-kindness meditation, and bolstered homework to facilitate improved functioning to repair TL and MI-related trauma. Method: The primary outcomes were the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), evaluated at baseline, throughout treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning was also administered), the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), the Dimensions of Anger Reactions, the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale, and the Quick Drinking Screen. Results: There were statistically significant between-group differences on two outcomes: The intent-to-treat (ITT) mixed-model analysis of SDS scores indicated greater improvement from baseline to posttreatment in the AD-E group (d = 2.97) compared to the PCT group, d = 1.86; -2.36, 95% CI [-3.92, -0.77], t(1,510) = -2.92, p <.001, d = 0.15. Twenty-one percent more AD-E cases made clinically significant changes on the SDS than PCT cases. From baseline to posttreatment, AD-E was also more efficacious on the CAPS-5 (d = 0.39). These differential effects did not persist at follow-up intervals. Conclusion: This was the first psychotherapy of veterans with TL/MI-related PTSD to show superiority relative to PCT with respect to functioning and PTSD, although the differential effect sizes were small to medium and not maintained at follow-up. What is the public health significance of this article?: Warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly multifarious clinical problem, partly because combat trauma can entail extensive traumatic loss and moral injury, either from personal transgressive acts or bearing witness to or being victimized by others' transgressions. Adaptive disclosure (AD) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that was designed to help service members and veterans with war-related PTSD. We applied lessons learned from previous research on AD and enhanced AD to better help war veterans with loss- and moral-injury-related PTSD. We compared the enhanced AD (AD-E) with present-centered therapy (PCT) in a clinical trial of 174 veterans with PTSD. We found AD-E to be superior to PCT with respect to helping veterans function better and in terms of reducing PTSD symptom burden. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Background and aim: Head and neck cancer patients are vulnerable to various psychological complications due to the effects of both cancer itself and cancer treatment on patients' appearance and physical well-being. Nevertheless, few data have been obtained on effective psychosocial interventions that could protect this group of cancer patients' psychological well-being. Therefore, this three-armed, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) aims to evaluate and compare the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive psychology (such as posttraumatic growth [PTG], hope, and optimism), quality of life (QoL), and psychological complications (depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance) among newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients. Methods and analysis: This RCT will target newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been treated only with surgery or who have not yet received any treatment. In total, 120 patients who meet all of the study's inclusion criteria and none of its exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into three groups-an ACT group, an MBSR group, and a treatment-as-usual control group-at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in the two intervention groups (the ACT and MBSR groups) will undergo an eight-week group intervention program. During this program, each intervention will comprise eight modules based on ACT and MBSR, respectively. Outcome assessments will be performed across a three-point timeline, including before the intervention (t0), immediately after the psychosocial intervention at eight weeks (t1), and six months after the intervention (t2). The primary outcome that will be assessed during this RCT is PTG. Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes that will be evaluated in this study are such as QoL, hope, optimism, depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance.

        "abstract": "Objective: Depression is a global key challenge in mental health care. The implementation of effective, low-risk and cost-effective interventions to reduce its disease burden is a necessity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the new Meditation-Based Lifestyle Modification (MBLM) program, a \"second-generation\" mindfulness-based intervention, in depressive outpatients. Methods: Eighty-one patients with mild to moderate depression were randomized into three groups: intervention group (MBLM), control group (CONTROL), and treatment as usual group (TAU). The primary outcome was the change of depressive symptoms as administered by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) after 4 and 8 weeks. Secondary outcome variables included the Brief Symptom Checklist-18 and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. A 6-month follow-up was conducted. Results: A greater reduction of depressive symptoms was found in MBLM participants compared to CONTROL (p <.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.11, d = 0.70) and TAU (p<.001,\u03b7p2=0.10,d=0.67 $p\\lt.001,{\\eta }_{{\\rm{p}}}^{2}=0.10,d=0.67$) with a 13.15 points reduction of BDI-II score versus 1.71 points (CONTROL) and 3.34 points (TAU) after 8 weeks. Between-group post hoc tests for all secondary outcomes and at follow-up also yielded significant between-group differences with medium to large effect sizes in favor of MBLM. Conclusions: Study results showed beneficial effects of MBLM in depressed outpatients. Further high-quality controlled clinical studies including qualitative research are needed to investigate the specific and unspecific effects of the MBLM program in depression and other medical conditions.

        "title": "Meditation affects word recognition of meditation novices.",
        "abstract": "This work represents one of the first attempts to examine the effects of meditation on the processing of written single words. In the present longitudinal study, participants conducted a lexical decision task and rated the affective valence of nouns before and after a 7-week class in mindfulness meditation, loving-kindness meditation, or a control intervention. Both meditation groups rated the emotional valence of nouns more neutral after the interventions, suggesting a general down-regulation of emotions. In the loving-kindness group, positive words were rated more positively after the intervention, suggesting a specific intensification of positive feelings. After both meditation interventions, response times in the lexical decision task accelerated significantly, with the largest facilitation occurring in the loving-kindness group. We assume that meditation might have led to increased attention, better visual discrimination, a broadened attentional focus, and reduced mind-wandering, which in turn enabled accelerated word recognition. These results extend findings from a previous study with expert Zen meditators, in which we found that one session of advanced meditation can affect word recognition in a very similar way.

        "abstract": "Buddhism is an ancient religion and philosophy of living that is practised worldwide. More recent interest in mindfulness as a practice and intervention in the West has highlighted Buddhist-derived concepts as useful in supporting health and well-being. As a result, the desire to understand Buddhism in its more complete form has strengthened. Although research into mindfulness and compassion is growing, there is a new interest in second-generation mindfulness, i.e. interventions that draw upon a more holistic use of Buddhist practices. To date, little research has explored this in Western contexts. For the current study, Nichiren Buddhists from the United Kingdom who had been practising for at least three years were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore their experience of this practice and how it informed their approach to daily life and, in particular, their health and well-being. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was employed as a method to understand the participants' experiences. Three themes were generated using an inductive approach: (1) finding meaning-\"All experiences have got so much value now\"- which reflected the participants' determination to seek purpose and value in all aspects of their life; (2) Buddhism as a needed 'tool'-\"I use it all the time\"-which revealed their practice as an important method to help them manage their lives; and (3) agency-\"I'm in control of my destiny\"-which highlighted the participants' engagement (supported by their Buddhist practice) in taking responsibility for their actions and responses. Findings indicate the need for future studies to further explore Buddhism as a mechanism for enhancing and sustaining well-being. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Mindful breathing meditation (MBM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) are common components of effective mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). This study examined the differential effects of MBM and LKM on purported therapeutic process variables and mental health outcomes via component analysis. The research design was a randomized controlled trial with four conditions: MBM, LKM, combined (MBM + LKM), and a relaxation control. All conditions consisted of 10-min. audio-recorded guided meditations that were self-implemented over the course of two weeks. Participants were college undergraduates (N = 52). Findings indicated statistically significant and very large main effects of time, regardless of condition. Statistically significant time by condition interactions were only observed for one process variable (i.e., defusion) and one mental health outcome (i.e., depression). Follow-up descriptive evaluation of between-group effect sizes indicated patterns of favorable effects for MBM and LKM over the combined and relaxation control conditions. Treatment integrity and treatment acceptability data indicated very favorable social validity across conditions. We conclude that our findings make a modest yet value-added contribution to the MBI component analysis literature, suggesting differentiated performance among isolated MBM and LKM exercises compared to combined and control conditions. Yet further research is warranted to improve upon the limitations of this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Infertility is a prominent problem affecting millions of couples worldwide. Recently, there has been a hightened emphasis on elucidating the subtle linkages between infertility treatment leveraging assisted reproductive technology and the complex realm of psychological challenges, as well as efforts in implementation of psychological interventions.The Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program seeks to improve self-compassion, compassion for others, mindfulness, and life satisfaction while reducing depression, anxiety, and stress. In the current study, an MSC intervention was performed on infertile women (IW) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms and enhancing life expectancy. Methods: Fifty-seven IW undergoing IVF were randomly allocated to two groups: MSC (n = 29) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 28). Participants in MSC met once a week for two hours for eight weeks and attended a half-day meditation retreat. The Synder's Hope questionnaire and the Revised 90-Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used as the primary outcome measures. Data were obtained before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and two months post-intervention. Repeated measures of ANCOVA and paired t-tests in all assessment points were used to compare the MSC and the TAU groups in outcomes. Results: In the MSC group, hopelessness, anger-hostility, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity difficulties, and depression were significantly reduced compared with the TAU group, and those improvements persisted at the two-month follow-up. Reliable change index revealed that the MSC group's gains were both clinically significant and durable. Conclusions: MSC can facilitate higher life satisfaction and mental well-being for IW undergoing IVF by reducing psychological distress, psychopathological symptoms, and hopelessness. These encouraging findings call for more research into the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies in addressing psychological problems among IW undergoing IVF.

A total of 100 adults with chronic or current problematic pain completed a survey and were randomized to a 20-minute MM, LKM, or audiobook control. Co-primary outcomes of pain intensity and unpleasantness and mediators of mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed pre- and posttraining. Expectancies were assessed pretraining. Pain type (chronic vs current problematic) was a covariate. Relative to the control, higher expectancies were reported for MM and LKM (<italic>P</italic> < .001). MM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.41, <italic>P</italic> = .032) and LKM (<italic>d</italic> = 0.38, <italic>P</italic> = .027) had medium effects on pain intensity, with greater decreases than control (<italic>d</italic> = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> = .768).

This study examined the effects of LKM in a parenting context, using a fifteen-minute audio-guided LKM. In a group-based design micro trial, a total of 61 parents (50 female, mean age = 38.41 years, SD = 6.11) were randomly assigned to receive a LKM or a matched control focused imagery (FI) exercise. Participants completed a series of measures that examined compassion, parenting and child behavior, and parent's emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses to a set of six hypothetical vignettes describing difficult child behavior. We also assessed for parents' acceptability towards LKM as a strategy. As predicted, parents who received LKM displayed higher levels of self-compassion and motivation to show themselves compassion compared to the control group; however not compassion towards others. Parents in the LKM compared to the FI group also had more positive (e.g., calm and sympathetic) and less negative emotional (e.g., frustration and anger) responses to the situations of childhood distress; however, parent's cognitive and behavioral responses did not significantly change. Parent's also found LKM to be highly acceptable, with 60% indicating they would complete it weekly. The present findings suggest that LKM might be a valuable component to include in evidence-based parenting interventions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "title": "Cultivating ideal mentalities in second-generation mindfulness-based interventions: A feature bringing challenges but more contributions",
        "abstract": "Objectives As an important trend in the research on and practice of mindfulness, second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) expanded components and emphasized ethics and wisdom. The current article proposes another important feature of SG-MBIs, the cultivation of ideal mentalities, such as the nondifferential four immeasurables (i.e., equal prosocial attitudes toward different people) and mentalities of emptiness or oneness. Method The current article theoretically discusses and analyzes the challenges and contributions of SG-MBIs in cultivating ideal mentalities. Results The new feature of SG-MBIs, cultivation of ideal mentalities, leads to five interconnected challenges for research and practice: (1) providing empirical and theoretical support for new elements; (2) matching the purposes of interventions with the needs of trainees; (3) achieving ideal mentalities during interventions; (4) assessing ideal mentalities in proper ways; and (5) clarifying the ethics and values for trainees. Conclusions These challenges posed by the new feature need to be discussed and addressed in the future. Nevertheless, SG-MBIs effectively embody the objectives of ideal psychology and illustrate methodological principles in research on ideal mentalities, which will benefit research on other ideal mentalities rooted in different traditions.

        "abstract": "Background and aims: Workaholism is a form of behavioral addiction that can lead to reduced life and job satisfaction, anxiety, depression, burnout, work-family conflict, and impaired productivity. Given the number of people affected, there is a need for more targeted workaholism treatments. Findings from previous case studies successfully utilizing second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) for treating behavioral addiction suggest that SG-MBIs may be suitable for treating workaholism. This study conducted a controlled trial to investigate the effects of an SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (MAT) on workaholism. Methods: Male and female adults suffering from workaholism (n = 73) were allocated toMAT or a waiting-list control group. Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up phases. Results: MAT participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control-group participants in workaholism symptomatology, job satisfaction, work engagement, work duration, and psychological distress. Furthermore, compared to the control group, MAT participants demonstrated a significant reduction in hours spent working but without a decline in job performance. Discussion and conclusions:MAT may be a suitable intervention for treating workaholism. Further controlled intervention studies investigating the effects of SG-MBIs on workaholism are warranted.

        "title": "Looking Inside the Black Box of Mindfulness Meditation: Investigating Attention and Awareness During Meditation Using the Mindful Awareness Task (MAT).",
        "abstract": "Training attention and awareness in mindfulness meditation is theorized to be essential for the cultivation of mindfulness and its salutary outcomes. Yet, the empirical foundation for this central premise in mindfulness science is surprisingly small due to a limited methodological capacity to measure attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation. Accordingly, we set out to measure and study these processes in a laboratory study (N = 143, 76.92% female) using a novel behavioral measurement paradigm-the mindful awareness task (MAT). We empirically characterized attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation and found novel behavioral evidence indicating that, as long-theorized, these processes were related to previous mindfulness meditation practice, attitudinal qualities of mindfulness, attention regulation, and mental health. Furthermore, we found that the accuracy of self-reported mindfulness was, paradoxically, dependent on behavioral capacities for mindful awareness; and that sustained visual attention and executive functions, measured via cognitive-experimental tasks, were not meaningfully related to attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation. In contrast, the MAT demonstrated sound psychometric performance as a measure of mindful awareness, and may overcome significant limitations of extant mindfulness measurement methods. Collectively, findings challenge conceptual and methodological assumptions in mindfulness science, provide a novel paradigmatic direction for research on mindfulness, and present long-awaited evidence that attention and awareness during mindfulness meditation may indeed be fundamental to its practice, cultivation, and salutary functions. Public Significance Statement: Mindfulness meditation is implemented in a variety of settings and applications. Yet we lack empirical evidence, and methods to study, a central premise of this intervention approach-that training attention and awareness through mindfulness meditation is essential to its practice and salutary functions. Using a novel behavioral measurement paradigm, we provide long-awaited support for this central premise and show that this paradigm may help advance empirical understanding of mindfulness.

        "abstract": "Some individuals with developmental disabilities who reside in community group homes occasionally engage in low-frequency, but high-intensity, aggressive behavior. Over time, staff members assigned to manage the aggressive behaviors of these individuals are repeatedly injured, have to take time off work, become highly stressed, and eventually find alternative employment. In this study, we provided a 7-day intensive Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) training to staff from three group homes and measured the effects of such training on their use of verbal redirection and physical restraint, staff stress levels and turnover, staff and peer injuries, and benefit-cost analyses. When compared to baseline measures, results showed clinically and statistically significant reductions in the use of verbal redirection, complete disuse of physical restraints within a few weeks of MBPBS training, and cessation of staff and peer injuries. In addition, there was a significant reduction in staff stress and zero staff turnover. Finally, benefit-cost analysis showed substantial financial savings due to staff participation in the MBPBS program. This study adds to the extant research suggestive of mindfulness-based interventions being effective in reducing the use of restraints, decreasing staff stress, and providing financial savings to the service providers of individuals with developmental disabilities.

The research addressed if (a) mindfulness meditation and (b) mindfulness with self-compassion Meditation (through loving kindness meditation and psycho-educational material to develop self-compassion) aid weight loss and maintenance. Sixty-three soldiers followed independent diet plans and were randomly assigned to a control group, or, one of the two meditation interventions for 5 weeks. Participants lost weight in both experimental groups, while the control group gained weight during the initial 5 weeks. Six months of subsequent, self-motivated and unguided meditative practice, revealed that only the mindfulness with self-compassion meditation group continued losing weight, while the mindfulness meditation group showed no significant weight differences. At a 1-year follow-up, both experimental groups regained some weight, while the control group paradoxically lost weight. Overall, however, the mindfulness with self-compassion meditation group lost significantly more weight than either of the two remaining groups (which did not significantly differ). The findings suggest that developing both mindfulness and self-compassion appears more promising for weight loss than developing mindfulness alone or simply dieting; nevertheless, weight maintenance requires more attention in future research.

        "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the effect of breathing awareness meditation (BAM), Botvin LifeSkills Training (LST), and health education control (HEC) on ambulatory blood pressure and sodium excretion in African American adolescents. Methods: Following 3 consecutive days of systolic blood pressure (SBP) screenings, 166 eligible participants (i.e., SBP > 50th-95th percentile) were randomized by school to either BAM (n = 53), LST (n = 69), or HEC (n = 44). In-school intervention sessions were administered for 3 months by health education teachers. Before and after the intervention, overnight urine samples and 24-hour ambulatory SBP, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were obtained. Results: Significant group differences were found for changes in overnight SBP and SBP, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate over the 24-hour period and during school hours. The BAM treatment exhibited the greatest overall decreases on these measures (Bonferroni adjusted, ps < .05). For example, for school-time SBP, BAM showed a change of -3.7 mmHg compared with no change for LST and a change of -.1 mmHg for HEC. There was a nonsignificant trend for overnight urinary sodium excretion (p = .07), with the BAM group displaying a reduction of -.92 \u00b1 1.1 mEq/hr compared with increases of .89 \u00b1 1.2 mEq/hr for LST and .58 \u00b1 .9 mEq/hr for HEC group. Conclusion: BAM appears to improve hemodynamic function and may affect sodium handling among African American adolescents who are at increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease.

        "abstract": "Appreciative joy, as one of the four immeasurables in Buddhism, refers to feeling happy for people, and it is cultivated by appreciative joy meditation (AJM). There is a debate regarding whether appreciative joy is conceptually the same as positive empathy (empathy for others' positive experiences); thus, this report empirically tests the similarities and differences between appreciative joy and positive empathy. Study 1 recruited a sample of 317 general participants using an online survey and evaluated the similarities and differences between the Appreciative Joy Scale (AJS) and the Positive Empathy Scale (PES) on the outcome variables of altruism, envy, and subjective well-being. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the AJS and PES were independent of one another, and hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that AJS accounted for more variances on altruism than the PES. Study 2 recruited 119 participants in an experiment in a laboratory setting and compared the effects of AJM and the psychological operation of positive empathy in a matched setting on self-reported emotions and interpersonal attitudes. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that AJM generated significantly more other-focused positive emotions (e.g., love) in comparison with the positive empathy condition. These two studies supported that the concept and psychological operation of positive empathy differ from appreciative joy and AJM in Buddhism. In particular, the results in terms of altruism and other-focused positive emotions supported the conceptual analysis that appreciative joy directly involves kind intentions toward the target, whereas positive empathy does not necessarily do so.

        "abstract": "The four immeasurables meditations (FIMs) cultivate four different attitudes in Buddhism. However, in psychological research, these meditations have been combined and their differences have not been directly evaluated. The current study provided the first comparison between appreciative joy meditation (AJM) and compassion meditation (CM). Ninety college students were allocated to three groups which included AJM, CM, and neutral facial visualization in a laboratory setting. The students were asked to practice corresponding meditations for friends followed by that for strangers. The self-reported emotions were measured before and after the meditations for different targets, and the emotional Stroop task was administered following the meditation for friends. The major findings included the following: (1) AJM and CM for strangers enhanced other-focused positive emotions (e.g., love) compared with the control group, indicating both AJM and CM promote pro-socialness. (2) Compared with the other conditions, CM for friends and for strangers increased sadness and CM for friends decreased happiness and overall positive emotional valence, whereas AJM for strangers enhanced happiness and overall positive emotional valence, suggesting that the two FIMs had different effects on emotional valence. (3) There were no significant interactions for self-focused positive emotions (e.g., pride) or interpersonal negative emotions (e.g., envy), but AJM exhibited a potential effect on the suppression of interpersonal negative emotions compared with the other conditions. (4) No significant interaction was found for low arousal positive emotions (e.g., calm) and overall arousal. (5) Findings from the Stroop task indicated that AJM tended to result in longer reaction times compared with the other groups, and daily appreciative joy also affected the reaction times. These findings indicate that FIMs should be differentiated in psychological research because of their different effects. The potential mechanisms underlying the effects of FIMs and their implications for research and practice of FIMs were also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "abstract": "Compassion is critical for societal wellbeing. Yet, it remains unclear how specific thoughts and feelings motivate compassionate behavior, and we lack a scientific understanding of how to effectively cultivate compassion. Here, we conducted 2 studies designed to a) develop a psychological model predicting compassionate behavior, and b) test this model as a mediator of a Compassion Meditation (CM) intervention and identify the 'active ingredients' of CM. In Study 1, we developed a model predicting compassionate behavior, operationalized as real-money charitable donation, from a linear combination of self-reported tenderness, personal distress, perceived blamelessness, and perceived instrumental value of helping with high cross-validated accuracy, r = .67, p < .0001. Perceived similarity to suffering others did not predict charitable donation when controlling for other feelings and attributions. In Study 2, a randomized controlled trial, we tested the Study 1 model as a mediator of CM and investigated active ingredients. We compared a smartphone-based CM program to 2 conditions-placebo oxytocin and a Familiarity intervention-to control for expectancy effects, demand characteristics, and familiarity effects. Relative to control conditions, CM increased charitable donations, and changes in the Study 1 model of feelings and attributions mediated this effect (pab = .002). The Familiarity intervention led to decreases in primary outcomes, while placebo oxytocin had no significant effects on primary outcomes. Overall, this work contributes a quantitative model of compassionate behavior, and informs our understanding of the change processes and intervention components of CM.

        "abstract": "Background: Compared with other parents, mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disabilities experience more stress, illness, and psychiatric problems. Although the cumulative stress and disease burden of these mothers is exceptionally high, and associated with poorer outcomes in children, policies and practices primarily serve the identified child with disabilities. Methods: A total of 243 mothers of children with disabilities were consented and randomized into either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (mindfulness practice) or Positive Adult Development (positive psychology practice). Well-trained, supervised peer mentors led 6 weeks of group treatments in 1.5-hour weekly sessions, assessing mothers 6 times before, during, and up to 6 months after treatment. Mothers had children with autism (65%) or other disabilities (35%). At baseline, 85% of this community sample had significantly elevated stress, 48% were clinically depressed, and 41% had anxiety disorders. Results: Using slopes-as-outcomes, mixed random effects models, both treatments led to significant reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety, and improved sleep and life satisfaction, with large effects in depression and anxiety. Mothers in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction versus Positive Adult Development had greater improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep, and well-being. Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder improved less in anxiety, but did not otherwise differ from their counterparts. Conclusions: Future studies are warranted on how trained mentors and professionals can address the unmet mental health needs of mothers of children with developmental disabilities. Doing so improves maternal wellbeing and furthers their long-term caregiving of children with complex developmental, physical, and behavioral needs.

        "abstract": "We investigated state effects of two forms of meditation on electroencephalography prefrontal \u03b1-asymmetry, a global indicator of approach versus withdrawal motivation and related affective state. A clinical series of previously depressed individuals were guided to practice either mindfulness breathing meditation (N=8) or a form of meditation directly aimed at cultivating positive affect, loving kindness or metta meditation (N=7). Prefrontal asymmetry was assessed directly before and after the 15-min meditation period. Results showed changes in asymmetry towards stronger relative left prefrontal activation, i.e., stronger approach tendencies, regardless of condition. Further explorations of these findings suggested that responses were moderated by participants' tendencies to engage in ruminative brooding. Individuals high in brooding tended to respond to breathing meditation but not loving kindness meditation, while those low in brooding showed the opposite pattern. Comparisons with an additionally recruited 'rest' group provided evidence suggesting that changes seen were not simply attributable to habituation. The results indicate that both forms of meditation practice can have beneficial state effects on prefrontal \u03b1-asymmetry and point towards differential indications for offering them in the treatment of previously depressed patients.

Negative self-evaluative processes interfere with the ability to attend and register physiological changes (interoceptive awareness). This study explores the effect of mindfulness meditation training on interoceptive awareness and the three categories of known barriers to healthy sexual functioning: attention, self-judgment, and clinical symptoms. Methods: Forty-four college students (30 women) participated in either a 12-week course containing a 'meditation laboratory' or an active control course with similar content or laboratory format. Interoceptive awareness was measured by reaction time in rating physiological response to sexual stimuli. Psychological barriers were assessed with self-reported measures of mindfulness and psychological well-being. Results: Women who participated in the meditation training became significantly faster at registering their physiological responses (interoceptive awareness) to sexual stimuli compared with active controls (F(1,28) = 5.45, p = .03, \u03b7p2 = 0.15). Female meditators also improved their scores on attention (t = 4.42, df = 11, p = .001), self-judgment, (t = 3.1, df = 11, p = .01), and symptoms of anxiety (t = -3.17, df = 11, p = .009) and depression (t = -2.13, df = 11, p < .05). Improvements in interoceptive awareness were correlated with improvements in the psychological barriers to healthy sexual functioning (r = -0.44 for attention, r = -0.42 for self-judgment, and r = 0.49 for anxiety; all p < .05).

Groups responded similarly to nonmasked pictures. In the masked condition, only controls showed discrimination in valence self-reports. However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination in the masked condition.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) perceive that their cognition has declined but do not show objective impairment on neuropsychological tests. Individuals with SCD are at elevated risk of objective cognitive decline and incident dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions (including mindfulness-based and health self-management approaches) are a potential strategy to maintain or improve cognition in SCD, which may ultimately reduce dementia risk. METHODS: This study utilized data from the SCD-Well randomized controlled trial. One hundred forty-seven older adults with SCD (M(Age) = 72.7 years; 64% female) were recruited from memory clinics in four European countries and randomized to one of two group-based, 8-week interventions: a Caring Mindfulness-based Approach for Seniors (CMBAS) or a health self-management program (HSMP). Participants were assessed at baseline, post-intervention (week 8), and at 6-month follow-up (week 24) using a range of cognitive tests. From these tests, three composites were derived-an \"abridged\" Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5(Abridged)), an attention composite, and an executive function composite. Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Linear mixed models evaluated the change in outcomes between and within arms and adjusted for covariates and cognitive retest effects. Sensitivity models repeated the per-protocol analyses for participants who attended \u2265 4 intervention sessions. RESULTS: Across all cognitive composites, there were no significant time-by-trial arm interactions and no measurable cognitive retest effects; sensitivity analyses supported these results. Improvements, however, were observed within both trial arms on the PACC5(Abridged) from baseline to follow-up (\u0394 [95% confidence interval]: CMBAS = 0.34 [0.19, 0.48]; HSMP = 0.30 [0.15, 0.44]). There was weaker evidence of an improvement in attention but no effects on executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Two non-pharmacological interventions conferred small, non-differing improvements to a global cognitive composite sensitive to amyloid-beta-related decline. There was weaker evidence of an effect on attention, and no evidence of an effect on executive function. Importantly, observed improvements were maintained beyond the end of the interventions. Improving cognition is an important step toward dementia prevention, and future research is needed to delineate the mechanisms of action of these interventions and to utilize clinical endpoints (i.e., progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia).

A randomized controlled trial in a sample of 42 physicians was used.

Significant improvements in favor of the experimental group compared with the control group on the levels of mindfulness and relaxation (including positive emotional states, such as at ease/peace, renewal, energy, optimism, happiness, acceptance, and even transcendence) were obtained after eight weeks. Remarkably, change magnitudes (effect size) significantly increased at the end of the maintenance period after a year, especially for mindfulness and positive energy. Additionally, heart rate significantly decreased for the intervention group and maintained a year after the beginning of the treatment.

Thirty undergraduate psychology students participated (15 in the intervention group, and 15 as wait-list controls). Those in the intervention arm engaged well with the course and formal at-home practice, attending at least five sessions and meditating between 4-6 days per week. Significant improvements in perceived stress, psychological distress, mindfulness skills, decentering, self-compassion, and experiential avoidance were found at the end of the intervention, while the wait-list group remained unchanged. There were significant differences between the two groups in those variables at post-test, favoring the intervention arm with major effects. Reductions in stress were mediated by improvements in mindfulness skills, decentering, and self-compassion; meanwhile reductions in psychological distress were mediated by improvements in decentering. These results suggest that this intervention might be feasible and effective for university students, but more high-quality research is needed.",

Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant increase in mindfulness (F((2,91)) = 3.271; p = 0.042; \u03b7(2) = 0.067) and self-compassion (F((2,91)) = 6.046; p = 0.003; \u03b7(2) = 0.117) in the post-test visit, and in self-compassion (F((2,79)) = 3.880; p = 0.025; \u03b7(2) = 0.089) in the follow-up visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program. The standard MBSR and MSC training program improves levels of mindfulness and self-compassion, and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and resident intern specialists. New studies are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of abbreviated training programs.",

        "abstract": "In addition to its health benefits, mindfulness has been theorized in classical contemplative frameworks to elicit self-transcendent experiences as a means of promoting universal love and compassion. Increasing feelings of love may be especially clinically relevant for the treatment of opioid misuse, in that addictive use of opioids dysregulates neurobiological processes implicated in the experience of love. Here we tested these hypotheses in a secondary analysis (n = 187) of data from a randomized clinical trial of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) versus supportive psychotherapy for comorbid opioid misuse and chronic pain. At pre- and post-treatment, participants completed a measure of state self-transcendence immediately following a laboratory-based mindfulness task. Through 9-month follow-up, we assessed changes in universal love and opioid misuse. Participants also completed ecological momentary assessments of opioid craving during the 8-week study interventions and for the following month. Compared to supportive psychotherapy, participants in MORE reported significantly greater increases in mindfulness-induced self-transcendence, which mediated the effect of MORE on increased feelings of universal love. In turn, increases in universal love significantly predicted decreased opioid craving and lower odds opioid misuse through 1- and 9-month follow-ups, respectively. Findings suggest mindfulness-induced self-transcendence may promote feelings of universal love, with possible downstream benefits on reducing addictive behavior.",

        "abstract": "Stress is one of the most common problems among healthcare professionals, as they are exposed to potentially stressful and emotionally challenging situations in the workplace. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training programs have been shown to decrease stress. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an abbreviated 4-weeks MBSR training program in relation to a standard 8-weeks one on the stress levels. A controlled and randomized clinical trial was designed, in which 112 tutors and resident intern specialists in Family and Community Medicine and Nursing of six Spanish National Health System teaching units (TUs) participated. Participants included in the experimental groups (EGs) received a MBRS training program (standard or abbreviated), while control group (CG) participants did not receive any intervention. The stress levels were assessed by the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) in three different moments during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant reduction in stress (F((2,91)) = 5.165; p = 0.008; \u03b7(2) = 0.102) in the post-test visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program, but without the maintenance of its effects over time. No significant impact of the abbreviated training program on stress levels was observed in the intergroup comparison. A standard 8-weeks MBSR training program aimed at tutors and resident intern specialists in Family and Community Medicine and Nursing produces significant improvements in stress levels compared with the abbreviated intervention and no intervention. New studies about abbreviated training programs are needed to provide effective treatments which improve well-being of these professionals.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) for reducing affective distress in a sample of outpatients with depressive, anxiety, or adjustment disorders, and to explore its mechanisms of action. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial involved the assessment time points of pretreatment, posttreatment and 6-month follow-up. A total of 90 patients from three mental health units in Castellon, Spain, were recruited and randomly assigned to \"ABCT + treatment as usual (TAU),\" \"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) + TAU\" or \"TAU\" alone. Affective distress, as measured by the \"Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales\" (DASS-21) was the main outcome; self-compassion and mindfulness were also assessed. Multilevel mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effectiveness of the program, and path analyses were conducted to study the potential mechanistic role of mindfulness and self-compassion. RESULTS: ABCT was not superior to MBSR in any outcome or at any assessment point. ABCT was superior to TAU alone both posttreatment (B = -13.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -19.57, -6.84) and at 6-month follow-up (B = -7.20; 95% CI: -13.63, -0.76) for reducing DASS-21, and MBSR was superior to TAU alone both posttreatment (B = -11.51; 95% CI: -17.97, -5.05) and at 6-month follow-up (B = -8.59; 95% CI: -15.09, -2.10), with large effects (d \u2265 0.90). Changes produced by ABCT in DASS-21 were mediated by self-compassion, whereas changes produced by MBSR were mediated by both mindfulness and self-compassion. CONCLUSION: ABCT is effective for reducing affective distress in patients with anxiety, depressive and adjustment disorders, although its effect is not superior to that offered by MBSR. Self-compassion seems to be a significant mediator of the effects of ABCT.",

The essence of nursing is care and compassion. While there are studies on compassion in nursing care, nurses' self-compassion is an underrecognized concept in the literature. METHODS: The study employed a randomized controlled design and involved 80 seconds-grade nursing students from a university in Turkey between December 2021 and June 2022. The intervention group received an online program consisting of six weekly sessions, while the control group did not receive any intervention. The data were collected using the Promotive and Protective Health Behaviors Scale, Watson Caritas Self-Rating Score, Brief Resilience Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale before, at the end of, and 5 months after the program. RESULTS: In both the post-test and follow-up test, the intervention group exhibited an increase in health-promoting and protective behaviors, self-care perception, psychological resilience, and self-compassion compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is recommended to use the program to improve the physical and mental health of individuals in nursing practice areas. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include the program in the nursing education curriculum. Our findings provide evidence supporting the use of the program for nursing students and nurses.",

However, it remains unclear how different types of mental practice affect emotion processing at both the neuronal and the behavioural level. In the context of the ReSource project, 332 participants underwent an fMRI scan while performing an emotion anticipation task before and after three 3-month training modules cultivating 1) attention and interoceptive awareness (Presence); 2) socio-affective skills, such as compassion (Affect); 3) socio-cognitive skills, such as theory of mind (Perspective). Only the Affect module led to a significant reduction of experienced negative affect when processing images depicting human suffering. In addition, after the Affect module, participants showed significant increased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus when confronted with negative stimuli. We conclude that socio-affective, but not attention- or meta-cognitive based mental training is specifically effective to improve emotion regulation capabilities when facing adversity.",

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved assessment time points of baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. A total of 280 students from two Spanish universities were randomly assigned to 'MBP', 'MBP + VR', or 'Relaxation' (active controls). Perceived stress posttreatment was the primary outcome; wellbeing and academic functional outcomes were assessed as well. Multilevel mixed-effects models were performed to estimate the efficacy of the programme. RESULTS: Both 'MBP' (B = -2.77, d = -0.72, p = .006) and 'MBP + VR' (B = -2.44, d = -0.59, p = .014) were superior to 'Relaxation' in improving stress, as well as most of the secondary outcomes, with medium-to-large effects posttreatment and at follow-up. The long-term effects of MBPs on stress were mediated by mindfulness and self-compassion in parallel. Treatment adherence was improved in the 'MBP + VR' group, with higher retention rates and session attendance (p < .001).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevention programs that are 'transdiagnostic' may be more cost-effective and beneficial, in terms of reducing levels of psychopathology in the general population, than those focused on a specific disorder. This randomized controlled study evaluated the efficacy of one such intervention program called Resilience Training (RT). METHODS: College students who reported mildly elevated depressive or subclinical psychotic symptoms ('psychotic experiences' (PEs)) (n = 107) were randomized to receiving RT (n = 54) or to a waitlist control condition (n = 53). RT consists of a four-session intervention focused on improving resilience through the acquisition of mindfulness, self-compassion, and mentalization skills. Measures of symptoms and these resilience-enhancing skills were collected before and after the 4-week RT/waitlist period, with a follow-up assessment 12-months later. RESULTS: Compared to the waitlist control group, RT participants reported significantly greater reductions in PEs, distress associated with PEs, depression, and anxiety, as well as significantly greater improvements in resilience, mindfulness, self-compassion, and positive affect, following the 4-week RT/waitlist period (all p < 0.03). Moreover, improvements in resilience-promoting skills were significantly correlated with symptom reductions (all p < 0.05). Lastly, the RT-related reductions in PEs and associated distress were maintained at the 12-month follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: RT is a brief, group-based intervention associated with improved resilience and reduced symptoms of psychopathology, with sustained effects on PEs, in transdiagnostically at-risk young adults. Follow-up studies can further assess the efficacy of RT relative to other interventions and test whether it can reduce the likelihood of developing a serious mental illness.",

        "abstract": "Self-compassion as an outcome and potential mediator in mindfulness-based interventions has gained increased attention in the last years. However, most mediation studies had several methodological shortcomings which precluded robust conclusions regarding its mediating role. This randomized controlled study aimed to address these issues by assessing self-compassion, as proposed mediator and outcome, in a temporal sequence. Eighty-one patients with current depression and work-related conflicts were randomly assigned to either an eight-week mindfulness-based day hospital treatment (MDT-DH; n = 47; including psychopharmacological treatment if necessary) or a waitlist control condition including a psychopharmacological consultation (PCC; n = 34). The outcome, depression severity, was assessed before, at mid-treatment and after the treatment while the proposed mediator, self-compassion, was measured at two week-intervals from before treatment until directly after treatment. Within-person and between-person mediation effects were analysed using multilevel structural equation modelling. The results from the mediation models show that self-compassion (as a general factor) and two of its components (mindfulness of personal suffering and common humanity) increased and mediated the change in depressive symptoms over time. This study provides preliminary support for self-compassion as a mediator of treatment effects on depression in a mindful depression treatment.",

Here we report on a randomized controlled trial of MBSR for older adults and its effects on executive function, left frontal asymmetry of the EEG alpha band, and antibody response. METHODS: Older adults (n = 201) were randomized to MBSR or waiting list control. The outcome measures were: the Trail Making Test part B/A (Trails B/A) ratio, a measure of executive function; changes in left frontal alpha asymmetry, an indicator of positive emotions or approach motivation; depression, mindfulness, and perceived stress scores, and the immunoglobulin G response to a protein antigen, a measure of adaptive immunity. RESULTS: MBSR participants had a lower Trails B/A ratio immediately after intervention (p < 0.05); reduced shift to rightward frontal alpha activation after intervention (p = 0.03); higher baseline antibody levels after intervention (p < 0.01), but lower antibody responses 24 weeks after antigen challenge (p < 0.04), and improved mindfulness after intervention (p = 0.023) and at 21 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: MBSR produced small but significant changes in executive function, mindfulness, and sustained left frontal alpha asymmetry. The antibody findings at follow-up were unexpected. Further study of the effects of MBSR on immune function should assess changes in antibody responses in comparison to T-cell-mediated effector functions, which decline as a function of age.",

This study aims at testing the efficacy of 'Unlearning', a mindfulness and compassion-based programme, for reducing aggressive attitudes in adolescents. Method: A sample of 164 students from three high schools in Zaragoza (Spain) participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to (1) 'Unlearning', or (2) relaxation programme. Three assessment points were established: baseline, post-treatment and a 4-month follow-up. The outcome variables were the subscales of the 'Attitudes Toward Social Aggression Scale'. Mindfulness and compassion were assessed as secondary outcomes. Results: 'Unlearning' did not produce changes in the primary outcomes, but significant effects were observed post-treatment in self-compassion; and in the follow-up, in self-compassion and mindfulness. The control group did not experience any change post-treatment, but a significant effect in mindfulness was observed in the follow-up. The intergroup analyses indicated that 'Unlearning' improved self-compassion, both post-treatment (t = -2.48, p = 0.014) and after 4-months (t = -2.03, p = 0.044), although these results were not statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: 'Unlearning' did not produce significant reductions in aggressive attitudes compared to the control group. The low baseline levels may have hindered the efficacy of the interventions. 'Unlearning' showed potential to improve self-compassion, which is related to nonviolence, and this may have positive implications for the adolescents.

        "abstract": "The Emotion Focused Training for Self-Compassion and Self-Protection (EFT-SCP) is an intervention developed to increase skills of self-compassion and protective anger with the aim to decrease self-criticism. This novel intervention was developed on the basis of the latest findings on self-criticism from Emotion-focused therapy and previous programs cultivating compassion (namely Compassion Mind Training and Mindful Self-Compassion Program). According to existing research, simply cultivating self-compassion is not always sufficient in reducing self-criticism. Therefore, the EFT-SCP was designed to build self-compassion whilst developing protective anger to combat self-criticism. Our goal was to investigate the efficacy of this new, short-term, online EFT-SCP program in a non-clinical population. A randomized control trial was conducted with pre- and post-intervention measurements and two-month follow-up of self-compassion and self-criticism/reassurance. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants through a snowballing technique on social media. A total of 123 participants were randomly allocated to the EFT-SCP intervention or to a control condition. The intervention group were instructed through emails to complete an EFT-SCP task every day for 14 consecutive days. The control group did not complete any tasks. Out of 123 participants, 31 from intervention group and 20 from control group completed all measurements. There was a significant effect of the EFT-SCP on increasing self-compassion and self-reassurance scores as reported at two-month follow-up. The EFT-SCP was also effective at reducing self-uncompassionate responding and self-criticism (specifically Hated self) with changes evident at two months post-intervention. These findings are encouraging and suggest that interventions designed to enhance self-compassion and decrease self-criticism can be delivered to broader populations without the direct contact with mental health professionals.",

However, which features of the VR training environment influence these training benefits remains poorly understood. This study was designed to provide the first empirical test of the potential value of visual biofeedback during self-compassion training. It was theorised that the provision of biofeedback may increase the benefits of training by increasing mindfulness, a core component of self-compassion. Sixty participants were randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions, both of which comprised VR-based self-compassion training, but only one of which included visual biofeedback (a red pulsating light representing heart rate). Relative to scores at baseline, participants reported greater self-compassion, and lower self-criticism, anxiety, and stress after VR self-compassion training. However, the provision of biofeedback did not influence the strength of these training effects. These data provide further evidence that VR administered self-compassion training may deliver potentially important mental health benefits, but also meaningfully extends this literature by proving the first evidence that visual biofeedback does not influence the strength of these benefits.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medical students are exposed to an emotionally exhausting training/work environment and to stressful academic demands. Consequently, psychopathologies, burnout and suicidal ideation are frequent in this population. These factors can also affect their empathy and quality of care. Therefore, the development and implementation of programs to promote resilience to stress specifically in medical students and the evaluation of their efficiency are a priority. Here, we describe the protocol of the first French study to assess the long-term effectiveness and acceptability of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) compared with relaxation training (RT) to reduce emotional exhaustion in medical students. METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled trial (\"Must prevent\") plans to enroll 612 students in the fourth and fifth year of medical studies from nine French universities. After inclusion, they will be assigned randomly to the MBI or RT group. Both interventions are structured around an 8-week program that includes one group class per week and daily at-home exercises. The primary endpoint is the emotional exhaustion score assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory at month 12 of the follow-up. Secondary endpoints include anxiety-depressive symptomatology, suicidality, psychoactive substance use, depersonalization, psychological and physical pain, empathy, emotional regulation, self-compassion, mindfulness, quality of life, and program acceptability. Evaluations will be done before and immediately after the 8-week intervention, and at month 6 and 12 of the post-intervention follow-up. DISCUSSION: If the proposed interventions are well accepted and useful to decrease negative emotions and/or increase wellbeing among medical students, they should be disseminated among this population and even included as part of the training on emotional skills needed for the routine medical practice.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) has serious medical and social consequences and leads to economic burden that threatens the sustainability of healthcare services. Thus, optimized management of pain tools to support CP patients in adjusting to their condition and improving their quality of life is timely. Although acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is considered an evidence-based psychological approach for CP, evidence for the efficacy of online-delivered ACT for CP is still scarce. At the same time, studies suggest that self-compassion mediates the change in disability and psychopathological symptoms in ACT interventions for CP, although self-compassion is not a specific target in ACT. Thus, an explicit focus on self-compassion might increase the efficacy of ACT interventions for CP, although this hypothesis has not been tested. This study aims to develop an eHealth ACT and compassion-based self-management intervention for CP, the iACTwithPain, and to compare its efficacy in improving health outcomes to a similar ACT-only intervention and a medical TAU group. METHODS: The eHealth platform that will host the interventions will be developed using a flat design identity and will be interactive. The iACTwithPain intervention will comprise eight weekly self-management sessions and will be developed taking into consideration the psychological flexibility model applied to CP, with the addition of explicit compassion-based components. To analyze whether the iACTwithPain intervention will present superiority in improving CP's impact and related health markers over the two other conditions, this study will follow an RCT design with three arms. CP patients will be recruited through direct contact with patient associations and healthcare services and a national press release in Portugal. Outcome measurement will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The interventions' acceptability will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: The iACTwithPain intervention is expected to improve CP patients' psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and empowerment, by promoting adaptive disease management and regulation of pain-related internal experiences. Results will contribute to a better understanding on the pertinence of adding compassion elements to ACT for CP and to reach an optimized intervention for CP.

        "abstract": "Here, we developed and examined a new way of disseminating mindfulness in nature to people without meditation experience, based on the finding that mindfulness conducted in natural settings may have added benefits. We evaluated a 5-day residential programme aiming to reduce stress and improve mental health outcomes. We compared an indoor and an outdoor version of the programme to a control group in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Sixty Danish university students experiencing moderate to high levels of stress were randomised into a residential mindfulness programme indoors (n = 20), in nature (n = 22), or a control group (n = 18). Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale and the Self-Compassion Scale (primary outcomes) along with additional secondary outcome measures at the start and end of the program and 3 months after. Stress was decreased with small to medium effect sizes post-intervention, although not statistically significant. Self-compassion increased post-intervention, but effect sizes were small and not significant. At follow-up, changes in stress were not significant, however self-compassion increased for both interventions with medium-sized effects. For the intervention groups, medium- to large-sized positive effects on trait mindfulness after a behavioural task were found post-intervention, and small- to medium-sized effects in self-reported mindfulness were seen at follow-up. Connectedness to Nature was the only outcome measure with an incremental effect in nature, exceeding the control with a medium-sized effect at follow-up. All participants in the nature arm completed the intervention, and so did 97% of the participants in all three arms. Overall, the results encourage the conduct of a larger-scale RCT, but only after adjusting some elements of the programme to better fit and take advantage of the potential benefits of the natural environment.",

The main outcome was psychological distress measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale at 6 months. Mediators included self-compassion (SC), mindfulness (FM), emotion regulation (ER), emotion suppression (ES), and cognitive reappraisal (CR). Baseline, post, and 3- and 6-month follow-up measurements were collected. Results: The mediated effects for CCT are as follows: depression at 6 months: SC: -1.81 (95% CI: -3.31 to -0.31); FM: -1.98 (95% CI: -3.65 to -0.33); ER: -0.14 (95% CI: -1.31 to 1.02); anxiety at 6 months: SC: -0.71 (95% CI: -1.82 to 0.40); FM: -1.24 (95% CI: -2.39 to -0.09); ER: 0.18 (95% CI: -1.04 to 1.40); stress at 6 months: SC: -1.44 (95% CI: -2.84 to -0.05); FM: -2.17 (95% CI: -3.63 to -0.71); ER: -0.27 (95% CI: -1.51 to 0.98). Conclusion: Mindfulness and self-compassion are important components in reducing psychological distress experienced by informal caregivers of people with a mental illness. Results contribute to the knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of CCT.",

        "title": "Group Metacognitive Therapy vs. Mindfulness Meditation Therapy in a Transdiagnostic Patient Sample: A Randomised Feasibility Trial.",
        "abstract": "Two transdiagnostic therapies for treating psychological disorder are Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). These two approaches have yet to be compared and therefore the current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a study of group MCT and MBSR in treating anxiety and depression. A feasibility trial with 40 participants (aged 19-56) was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either eight weeks of group MCT or MBSR. The primary outcome was feasibility which included recruitment rates, retention and treatment acceptability. The primary symptom outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score, which provided an overall measure of distress. Both treatments were found to be acceptable with low attrition and similar ratings of acceptability. Changes in outcomes were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle using mixed effect models. Preliminary analyses revealed that MCT was more effective in treating anxiety and depression in comparison to MBSR, and in reducing both positive and negative metacognitive beliefs. Reliable improvement rates favoured MCT at post-treatment and 6-month follow up. Both treatments appeared to be feasible and acceptable in treating transdiagnostic samples; however, a larger, definitive trial is required. The limitations and directions for future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to establish the effectiveness of a novel online quality of life (QoL) intervention tailored for people with late stage (\u2265 10 episodes) bipolar disorder (BD) compared with psychoeducation. Relative to early stage individuals, this late stage group may not benefit as much from existing psychosocial treatments. The intervention is a guided self-help, mindfulness based intervention (MBI) developed in consultation with consumers, designed specifically for web-based delivery, with email coaching support. METHODS/DESIGN: This international RCT will involve a comparison of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two 5-week adjunctive online self-management interventions: Mindfulness for Bipolar 2.0 and an active control (Psychoeducation for Bipolar). A total of 300 participants will be recruited primarily via social media channels. Main inclusion criteria are: a diagnosis of BD (confirmed via a phone-administered structured diagnostic interview), no current mood episode, history of 10 or more mood episodes, no current psychotic features or active suicidality, under the care of a medical practitioner. Block randomisation will be used for allocation to the interventions, and participants will retain access to the program for 6 months. Evaluations will be conducted at pre- and post- treatment, and at 3- and 6- months follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale (Brief QoL.BD), collected immediately post-intervention at 5 weeks (T1). Secondary measures include BD-related symptoms (mania, depression, anxiety, stress), time to first relapse, functioning, sleep quality, social rhythm stability and resource use. Measurements will be collected online and via telephone assessments at baseline (T0), 5 weeks (T1), three months (T2) and six months (T3). Candidate moderators (diagnosis, anxiety or substance comorbidities, demographics and current treatments) will be investigated as will putative therapeutic mechanisms including mindfulness, emotion regulation and self-compassion. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. Acceptability and any unwanted events (including adverse treatment reactions) will be documented and explored. DISCUSSION: This definitive trial will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel QoL focused, mindfulness based, online guided self-help intervention for late stage BD, and investigate its putative mechanisms of therapeutic action.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-meditation has a variety of benefits on well-being. However, individuals with primary attentional impairments (e.g. attention deficit disorder) or attentional symptoms secondary to anxiety, depression or addiction, may be less likely to benefit, and require additional mindfulness-augmenting strategies. AIMS: To determine whether a single dose of the cognitive enhancer, modafinil, acutely increases subjective and behavioural indices of mindfulness, and augments brief mindfulness training. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 (drug: placebo, modafinil) * 2 (strategy: mindfulness, relaxation control) experiment was conducted. Seventy-nine meditation-naive participants were assigned to: placebo-relaxation, placebo-mindfulness, modafinil-relaxation or modafinil-mindfulness. Pre-drug, post-drug and post-strategy state mindfulness, affect and autonomic activity, along with post-strategy sustained attention and mind-wandering were assessed within a single lab session. After the session, participants were instructed to practice their assigned behavioural strategy daily for one week, with no further drug administration, after which, follow-up measures were taken. RESULTS: As predicted, modafinil acutely increased state mindfulness and improved sustained attention. Differential acute strategy effects were found following mindfulness on autonomic activity but not state mindfulness. There were no strategy or drug effects on mind-wandering. However, exploratory analyses indicated that participants receiving modafinil engaged in more strategy practice across strategy conditions during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil acutely mimicked the effects of brief mindfulness training on state mindfulness but did not enhance the effects of this training. Limitations of the current study, and recommendations for future research examining modafinil as an adjunct to mindfulness- (or relaxation-) based treatments are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Longitudinal research investigating the enduring impact of mindfulness training is scarce. This study investigates the six-year effects of a seven-week mindfulness-based course, by studying intervention effects in the trajectory of dispositional mindfulness and coping skills, and the association between those change trajectories and subjective well-being at six-year follow-up. 288 Norwegian medical and psychology students participated in a randomized controlled trial. 144 received a 15-hour mindfulness course over seven weeks in the second or third semester with booster sessions twice yearly, while the rest continued their normal study curricula. Outcomes were subjective well-being, and dispositional mindfulness and coping assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Ways of Coping Checklist. Analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat sample, using latent growth curve models. At six-year follow-up, students receiving mindfulness training reported increased well-being. Furthermore, they reported greater increases in the trajectory of dispositional mindfulness and problem-focused coping along with greater decreases in the trajectory of avoidance-focused coping. Increases in problem-focused coping predicted increases in well-being. These effects were found despite relatively low levels of adherence to formal mindfulness practice. The findings demonstrate the viability of mindfulness training in the promotion of well-being and adaptive coping, which could contribute to the quality of care given, and to the resilience and persistence of health care professionals.

        "title": "Effect of compassion meditation on neuroendocrine, innate immune and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress.",
        "abstract": "Meditation practices may impact physiological pathways that are modulated by stress and relevant to disease. While much attention has been paid to meditation practices that emphasize calming the mind, improving focused attention, or developing mindfulness, less is known about meditation practices that foster compassion. Accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation practice influenced stress reactivity. Sixty-one healthy adults were randomized to 6 weeks of training in compassion meditation (n=33) or participation in a health discussion control group (n=28) followed by exposure to a standardized laboratory stressor (Trier social stress test [TSST]). Physiologic and behavioral responses to the TSST were determined by repeated assessments of plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and cortisol as well as total distress scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS). No main effect of group assignment on TSST responses was found for IL-6, cortisol or POMS scores. However, within the meditation group, increased meditation practice was correlated with decreased TSST-induced IL-6 (r(p)=-0.46, p=0.008) and POMS distress scores (r(p)=-0.43, p=0.014). Moreover, individuals with meditation practice times above the median exhibited lower TSST-induced IL-6 and POMS distress scores compared to individuals below the median, who did not differ from controls. These data suggest that engagement in compassion meditation may reduce stress-induced immune and behavioral responses, although future studies are required to determine whether individuals who engage in compassion meditation techniques are more likely to exhibit reduced stress reactivity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized pilot trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 5 week positive affect skills intervention (LILAC: lessons in linking affect and coping) for women with metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, we examined whether online delivery of the intervention would offer comparable benefits as in-person delivery. METHODS: Women with metastatic breast cancer (N = 39) were randomized to an in-person intervention, online intervention, or in-person attention-matched control. Psychological well-being (depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale], positive and negative affect [Differential Emotions Scale], cancer-specific quality of life [Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale-Cancer Version]), and positive coping (mindfulness, positive-affect skill use, and self-compassion [Self-Compassion Scale: Short-Form]) were assessed at baseline, 1 week post-intervention, and 1 month post-intervention follow-up. RESULTS: The LILAC intervention showed good feasibility, acceptability, and retention. Although the study was not adequately powered to detect between-group differences in change on preliminary efficacy outcomes, within-group comparisons revealed that LILAC participants (in-person and online combined) showed reductions in depression and negative affect by the 1 month follow-up (d = -0.81). Notably, LILAC participants fell below the clinical threshold for depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale = 16) by the 1 month follow-up (t[17] = -2.22, P = .04, d = -0.52), whereas control participants did not differ from threshold (t[9] = 0.45, P = .66, d = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: The LILAC intervention, regardless of delivery method, shows feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy for promoting psychological well-being in women with metastatic breast cancer. This research provides support for a larger randomized trial to test more definitively the potential benefits of LILAC. A strength of the LILAC intervention includes its innovative focus on positive affect. The efficacy of the online delivery suggests the potential for widespread Internet dissemination.",

We adapted mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for parents (MBCT-P) with a history of depression and describe its development, feasibility, acceptability and preliminary estimates of efficacy. Manual development involved interviews with 12 parents who participated in MBCT groups or pilot MBCT-P groups. We subsequently randomised 38 parents of children aged between 2 and 6 years to MBCT-P plus usual care (n = 19) or usual care (n = 19). Parents were interviewed to assess the acceptability of MBCT-P. Preliminary estimates of efficacy in relation to parental depression and children's behaviour were calculated at 4 and 9 months post-randomisation. Levels of parental stress, mindfulness and self-compassion were measured. Interviews confirmed the acceptability of MBCT-P; 78 % attended at least half the sessions. In the pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), at 9 months, depressive symptoms in the MBCT-P arm were lower than in the usual care arm (adjusted mean difference = -7.0; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = -12.8 to -1.1; p = 0.02) and 11 participants (58 %) in the MBCT-P arm remained well compared to 6 (32 %) in the usual care arm (mean difference = 26 %; 95 % CI = -4 to 57 %; p = 0.02). Levels of mindfulness (p = 0.01) and self-compassion (p = 0.005) were higher in the MBCT-P arm, with no significant differences in parental stress (p = 0.2) or children's behaviour (p = 0.2). Children's behaviour problems were significantly lower in the MBCT-P arm at 4 months (p = 0.03). This study suggests MBCT-P is acceptable and feasible.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a promising psychosocial treatment. This trial investigated the efficacy of MBCT + TAU v. TAU in reducing core symptoms in adults with ADHD. METHODS: A multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02463396). Participants were randomly assigned to MBCT + TAU (n = 60), an 8-weekly group therapy including meditation exercises, psychoeducation and group discussions, or TAU only (n = 60), which reflected usual treatment in the Netherlands and included pharmacotherapy and/or psychoeducation. Primary outcome was ADHD symptoms rated by blinded clinicians. Secondary outcomes included self-reported ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, positive mental health and general functioning. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Post-treatment effects at group and individual level, and follow-up effects were examined. RESULTS: In MBCT + TAU patients, a significant reduction of clinician-rated ADHD symptoms was found at post-treatment [M difference = -3.44 (-5.75, -1.11), p = 0.004, d = 0.41]. This effect was maintained until 6-month follow-up. More MBCT + TAU (27%) than TAU participants (4%) showed a \u2a7e30% reduction of ADHD symptoms (p = 0.001). MBCT + TAU patients compared with TAU patients also reported significant improvements in ADHD symptoms, mindfulness skills, self-compassion and positive mental health at post-treatment, which were maintained until 6-month follow-up. Although patients in MBCT + TAU compared with TAU reported no improvement in executive functioning at post-treatment, they did report improvement at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT might be a valuable treatment option alongside TAU for adult ADHD aimed at alleviating symptoms.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Older adults experiencing subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have a heightened risk of developing dementia and frequently experience subclinical anxiety, which is itself associated with dementia risk. OBJECTIVE: To understand whether subclinical anxiety symptoms in SCD can be reduced through behavioral interventions. METHODS: SCD-Well is a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention (caring mindfulness-based approach for seniors; CMBAS) is superior to a structurally matched health self-management program (HSMP) in reducing subclinical anxiety. Participants were recruited from memory clinics at 4 European sites. The primary outcome was change in anxiety symptoms (trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; trait-STAI) from pre- to postintervention. Secondary outcomes included a change in state anxiety and depression symptoms postintervention and 6 months postrandomization (follow-up). RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven participants (mean [SD] age: 72.7 [6.9] years; 64.6% women; CMBAS, n = 73; HSMP, n = 74) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was no difference in trait-STAI between groups postintervention (adjusted change difference: -1.25 points; 95% CI -4.76 to 2.25) or at follow-up (adjusted change difference: -0.43 points; 95% CI -2.92 to 2.07). Trait-STAI decreased postintervention in both groups (CMBAS: -3.43 points; 95% CI -5.27 to -1.59; HSMP: -2.29 points; 95% CI -4.14 to -0.44) and reductions were maintained at follow-up. No between-group differences were observed for change in state anxiety or depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A time-limited mindfulness intervention is not superior to health self-management in reducing subclinical anxiety symptoms in SCD. The sustained reduction observed across both groups suggests that subclinical anxiety symptoms in SCD are modifiable. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03005652.",

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Health centers in Roudan city, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty married women, ages 18 to 45 years, were recruited using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Participants were selected from health centers in 2022 via convenience sampling. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Upon their completion of a demographic checklist and the FSFI as a pretest, participants were divided into three groups, including lavender aromatherapy (n = 20), MBCT-S (n = 20), and control (n = 20) through random selection with permutation blocks. All groups completed FSFI as a posttest. Data were analyzed by SPSS 26 using chi-square, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney statistical tests. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference among the three groups before the intervention (p = .652), but there was a significant difference among them after the intervention (p = .001). There was a significantly positive difference between the intervention groups and the control group (p < .001). A significant relationship was observed among the three groups in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, lubrication, and arousal. The mean scores of the posttest in sexual desire, pain, satisfaction, and lubrication were positively higher in the MBCT-S group than in the aromatherapy group, and both intervention groups showed the same effect for sexual arousal. Aromatherapy and counseling had no significant effect on improving sexual orgasm. CONCLUSION: MBCT-S can be used to improve many aspects of female sexual function, except for orgasm disorders; aromatherapy may improve sexual arousal.",

MAPs showed significant improvement relative to HE on secondary outcome of mindfulness with between group difference of 10.7 (95% CI4.5-16.9), but not perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The comparable efficacy of Spanish and English formats of mindfulness meditation in improving depressive symptoms suggests that this community based intervention may mitigate depression risk in Latino adults who are experiencing social adversity.

        "title": "Yoga's effect on falls in rural, older adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unintentional falls affect 30% of people over age 65 years. Yoga has been shown to improve balance. We designed this study to examine if yoga reduces falls. METHODS: We conducted 16 sessions of Hatha yoga over 8 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to practice 10min of yoga daily at home in addition to 5-min relaxation exercises or relaxation exercises only (control group). RESULTS: Of the 38 participants completing the intervention, 15 participants reported a total of 27 falls in the 6-months before the study, compared to 13 participants sustaining 14 falls in the 6 months from the start of the study (p<0.047), without difference between yoga home-exercise and home relaxation-only groups. Compared to baseline scores, all participants improved on the Berg Balance Scale (53-54 out of 56, p=0.002), the Functional Gait Assessment (22.9-25.8 out of 30 points, p<0.001), and the Dynamic Gait Index (20.6-22.4 out of 24 points, p<0.001). Right leg stand time improved from a mean of 13.3s to 17.1s (p=0.020) and standing forward reach distance from 26.0cm to 29.6cm (p<0.001). Without difference between groups. Confidence, with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, increased in the yoga home-exercise group (88%-93%, p=0.037) compared to 90% unchanged from pre-intervention in the home relaxation-only group. CONCLUSION: Yoga classes reduce self-reported falls and improve balance measures. The addition of home yoga exercises did not enhance benefit over relaxation exercise only.",

        "title": "A mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students (MediMind): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medical training is very demanding and associated with a high prevalence of psychological distress. Compared to the general population, medical students are at a greater risk of developing a psychological disorder. Various attempts of stress management training in medical school have achieved positive results on minimizing psychological distress; however, there are often limitations. Therefore, the use of a rigorous scientific method is needed. The present study protocol describes a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a specifically developed mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students that includes selected elements of cognitive behavioral strategies (MediMind). METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol presents a prospective randomized controlled trial, involving four assessment time points: baseline, post-intervention, one-year follow-up and five-year follow-up. The aims include evaluating the effect on stress, coping, psychological morbidity and personality traits with validated measures. Participants are allocated randomly to one of three conditions: MediMind, Autogenic Training or control group. Eligible participants are medical or dental students in the second or eighth semester of a German university. They form a population of approximately 420 students in each academic term. A final total sample size of 126 (at five-year follow-up) is targeted. The trainings (MediMind and Autogenic Training) comprise five weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes each. MediMind will be offered to participants of the control group once the five-year follow-up is completed. The allotment is randomized with a stratified allocation ratio by course of studies, semester, and gender. After descriptive statistics have been evaluated, inferential statistical analysis will be carried out with a repeated measures ANOVA-design with interactions between time and group. Effect sizes will be calculated using partial \u03b7-square values. DISCUSSION: Potential limitations of this study are voluntary participation and the risk of attrition, especially concerning participants that are allocated to the control group. Strengths are the study design, namely random allocation, follow-up assessment, the use of control groups and inclusion of participants at different stages of medical training with the possibility of differential analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is recorded at German Clinical Trials Register under the number DRKS00005354 (08 November 2013).",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aims to intensively evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on mental illness risks (including psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress) and job strain (job control and job demands) for employees with poor mental health. METHODS: A longitudinal research design was adopted. In total, 144 participants were randomized to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group participated in MBI for eight weeks. Measurements were collected for both groups at five time points: at pre-intervention (T1), at mid-intervention (T2), at the completion of intervention (T3), four weeks after intervention (T4), and eight weeks after intervention (T5). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed model with two levels was employed to analyze the repeated measurement data. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the intercepts (means at T3) for the intervention group were significantly lower on psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress when MBI was completed. Even with the demographic variables controlled, the positive effects remained. For growth rates of prolonged fatigue and perceived stress, participants in the intervention group showed a steeper decrease than did the participants in the control group. Regarding job strain, although the intercept (mean at T3) of job demands showed a significant decline when BMI was completed, the significance disappeared when the demographic variables were controlled. Moreover, the other results for job control and job demands did not show promising findings. CONCLUSION: As a workplace health promotion program, the MBI seems to have potential in improving mental illness risks for employees with poor mental health. However, there was insufficient evidence to support its effect on mitigating job strain. Further research on maintaining the positive effects on mental health for the long term and on developing innovative MBI to suit job strain are recommended.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Police officers experience a high degree of chronic stress. Policing ranks among the highest professions in terms of disease and accident rates. Mental health is particularly impacted, evidenced by elevated rates of burnout, anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life than the general public. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, burnout and promote quality of life in a variety of settings, although its efficacy in this context has yet to be systematically evaluated. Therefore, this trial will investigate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention versus a waitlist control in improving quality of life and reducing negative mental health symptoms in police officers. METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled trial has three assessment points: baseline, post-intervention, and six-month follow-up. Active police officers (n = 160) will be randomized to Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP) or waitlist control group at two Brazilian major cities: Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo. The primary outcomes are burnout symptoms and quality of life. Consistent with the MBHP conceptual model, assessed secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and the potential mechanisms of resilience, mindfulness, decentering, self-compassion, spirituality, and religiosity. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will inform and guide future research, practice, and policy regarding police offer health and quality of life in Brazil and globally.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of incorporating Yoga into the treatment of eating disorders. This preliminary randomized controlled trial investigated the benefits of participating in an eight-week Kripalu Yoga program for 53 women with symptoms of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Compared to waitlist controls, Yoga participants experienced decreases in binge eating frequency, emotional regulation difficulties and self-criticism, and increases in self-compassion. Yoga participants also experienced increases in state mindfulness skills across the eight weeks of the Yoga program. While these results are encouraging and suggest Yoga may have a valuable role to play in the treatment of eating disorders, it is important to stress their tentative nature. Further research, adopting a more rigorous design, is needed to address the limitations of the present study and expand on these findings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Self-management of health is important for improving health outcomes among primary care patients with chronic disease. Anxiety and depressive disorders are common and interfere with self-regulation, which is required for disease self-management. An insurance-reimbursable mindfulness intervention integrated within primary care may be effective for enhancing chronic disease self-management behaviors among primary care patients with anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress-related and adjustment disorders compared with the increasingly standard practice of referring patients to outside mindfulness resources. OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC) is an 8-week, referral-based, insurance-reimbursable program integrated into safety-net health system patient-centered medical homes. We hypothesized that MTPC would be more effective for catalyzing chronic disease self-management action plan initiation within 2 weeks, versus a low-dose comparator (LDC) consisting of a 60-min mindfulness introduction, referral to community and digital resources, and addition to a 6-month waitlist for MTPC. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care providers (PCPs) and mental health clinicians referred 465 patients over 12 months. All participants had a DSM-V diagnosis. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: Participants (N = 136) were randomized in a 2:1 allocation to MTPC (n = 92) or LDC (n = 44) in a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial. MTPC incorporates mindfulness, self-compassion, and mindfulness-oriented behavior change skills and is delivered as insurance-reimbursable visits within primary care. Participants took part in a chronic disease self-management action planning protocol at week 7. MAIN MEASURES: Level of self-reported action plan initiation on the action plan initiation survey by week 9. KEY RESULTS: Participants randomized to MTPC, relative to LDC, had significantly higher adjusted odds of self-management action plan initiation in an intention-to-treat analysis (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.02 to 5.06, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week dose of mindfulness training is more effective than a low-dose mindfulness comparator in facilitating chronic disease self-management behavior change among primary care patients.",

        "title": "Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and treatment as usual in bipolar disorder.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite multiple pharmacological interventions, many people with bipolar disorder (BD) experience substantial residual mood symptoms, even in the absence of severe mood episodes, which have a negative impact on the course of illness and quality of life. Limited data are available on how to optimize treatment for BD, especially for those who suffer from persistent and residual depressive symptoms. Preliminary evidence suggests Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a psychological treatment option for BD. This study aims to investigate whether adding MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) will result in symptomatic and functional improvements in adults with BD compared to TAU alone. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, evaluator blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of MBCT + TAU and TAU alone in 160 adults with bipolar type I and type II. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), mid-treatment (Tmid), and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2), 9 (T3), 12 (T4), and 15 (T5) months follow-up. Primary outcome is post-treatment severity of depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician administered). Secondary outcomes are severity of (hypo) manic symptoms, anxiety, relapse rates, overall functioning, positive mental health, and cost-effectiveness. As possible mediators will be assessed rumination of negative affect, dampening and rumination of positive affect, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable insight into the (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT on clinician- and self-rated symptoms of BD, relapse rates, positive mental health, and overall functioning.

        "title": "Perinatal Women's Perspectives of, and Engagement in, Digital Emotional Well-Being Training: Mixed Methods Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological distress in the early postpartum period can have long-lasting deleterious effects on a mother's well-being and negatively affect her infant's development. Intervention approaches based in contemplative practices such as mindfulness and loving-kindness and compassion are intended to alleviate distress and cultivate well-being and can be delivered effectively as digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). OBJECTIVE: To understand the feasibility of engaging perinatal women in digital interventions, this study aimed to document participants' experiences in the Mums Minds Matter (MMM) study, a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing mindfulness, loving-kindness and compassion, and progressive muscle relaxation training delivered in a digital format and undertaken during pregnancy. To assess the different stages of engagement during and after the intervention, we adapted the connect, attend, participate, enact (CAPE) framework that is based on the idea that individuals go through different stages of engagement before they are able to enact change. METHODS: The MMM study was nested within a longitudinal birth cohort, The ORIGINS Project. We aimed to recruit 25 participants per randomization arm. Data were collected sequentially during the intervention through regular web-based surveys over 8 weeks, with opportunities to provide regular feedback. In the postintervention phase, qualitative data were collected through purposive sampling. RESULTS: Of 310 eligible women, 84 (27.1% [connect rate]) enrolled to participate in MMM. Of the remaining 226 women who did not proceed to randomization, 223 (98.7%) failed to complete the baseline surveys and timed out of eligibility (after 30 weeks' gestation), and 3 (1.3%) displayed high psychological distress scores. Across all program groups, 17 (20% [attend rate]) of the 84 participants actively opted out, although more may have disengaged from the intervention but did not withdraw. The main reasons for withdrawal were busy life and other priorities. In this study, we assessed active engagement and ongoing skills use (participate and enact) through postintervention interviews. We undertook 15 participant interviews, conducted 1 month to 3 months after the intervention. Our results provide insights into participant barriers and enablers as well as app changes, such as the ability to choose topics, daily reminders, case studies, and diversity in sounds. Implementing a DMHI that is brief, includes frequent prompts or nudges, and is easily accessible is a key strategy to target perinatal women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research will enable future app designs that are sufficiently nuanced to maximize the uptake, engagement, and application of mental health skills and contemplative practices in the perinatal period. Providing convenient access to engaging and effective prevention programs is critical and should be part of prenatal self-care. Our research underscores the appeal and feasibility of digital intervention approaches based in contemplative practices for perinatal women.

        "abstract": "Research on the usefulness of mindfulness and self-compassion for dieting has focused on meditative practices. However, meditation can be difficult to maintain, especially while dieting. Thus, the present research attempted to induce mindfulness and self-compassion by using food diaries that required the participant to either focus on concrete (i.e. how they are eating) construals or abstract (i.e. why they are eating) construals. The concrete construals were expected to increase mindfulness and self-compassion, as well as decrease avoidance and negative thoughts (which would further aid the development of mindfulness and self-compassion). Study 1 found that mindfulness and self-compassion mediated the inverse relationship of avoidance and negative thoughts with weight loss. Study 2 showed that concrete construal diaries increased mindfulness and self-compassion, decreased avoidance and negative thoughts, and supported weight loss significantly more than the abstract construal diaries. Study 3, then, compared the concrete construal diaries with a mindful self-compassionate meditation programme. There was no difference in weight loss at the end of the intervention, but at a three-month follow-up, the diaries performed better at weight maintenance. Thus, the concrete construal diaries may promote mindfulness and self-compassion and potentially promote long-term weight loss.",

        "abstract": "Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is characterized by signs and symptoms similar to substance use and gambling disorders, and associated with psychosocial impairments. Research suggests that maladaptive gaming-related cognitions and coping may be implicated in IGD; therefore, interventions for IGD need to target these underlying mechanisms. Mindfulness-based treatment is effective in changing maladaptive cognitive processes and increasing adaptive coping among people with addictions. Aims: This study used data from an RCT of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) for IGD to further examine changes in maladaptive gaming-related cognitions and positive reappraisal as mediators of the effects of MORE on IGD signs/symptoms. Methods: Participants (N = 30, Age M = 25.0, SD  = 5.4) were randomized to 8-weekly sessions of MORE or a support group (SG) control condition. IGD severity, levels of craving for video game playing, maladaptive gaming-related cognitions, and positive reappraisal were measured at pre-and posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Multivariate path analyses revealed that effects of MORE in reducing IGD and craving were statistically mediated by changes in maladaptive gaming-related cognitions. Though changes in positive reappraisal did not significantly mediate effects of MORE on IGD or craving, MORE enhanced positive reappraisal to a significantly greater extent than the SG at posttreatment. Discussion: Findings suggest that effects of mindfulness treatment in reducing maladaptive gaming-related cognitions might lead to reductions in IGD severity and cravings for video game playing. This cognitive mechanism should be evaluated in a future, full-scale RCT.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The incidence of breast cancer patients with negative body image has increased. However, research on interventions that explicitly reduce negative body image among breast cancer patients remains inadequate. The development of more pragmatic interventions is imperative. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) intervention to reduce the negative body image in breast cancer patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned 64 female breast cancer patients to either the MSC group or the control group. The MSC group received a 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion intervention, while the control group received no psychological training. Participants were surveyed by the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF), the Self-Acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and the Body Image Scale (BIS) at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 1-month follow-up (T3). RESULTS: All outcome variables demonstrated significant time main effects and nonsignificant group main effects. The MSC and control groups had significant time * group interaction effects on self-compassion, self-acceptance, perceived stress, and negative body image. Simple main effects analysis revealed significant improvements in outcome variables at three-time points for the MSC group. CONCLUSION: A 6-week online Mindful Self-Compassion intervention can improve self-compassion and self-acceptance and reduce perceived stress and negative body image among the breast cancer patients in MSC group. Mindful Self-Compassion intervention shows promise as a viable way to maintain the mental well-being of breast cancer patients.",

        "title": "Recovery from recurrent depression: Randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of mindfulness-based compassionate living compared with treatment-as-usual on depressive symptoms and its consolidation at longer term follow-up.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with recurrent or chronic depression. However, sequential, follow-up interventions are needed to further improve outcome for this group of patients. One possibility is to cultivate mechanisms thought to support recovery from depression, such as (self-)compassion. The current study examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based compassionate living (MBCL) in recurrently depressed patients who previously received MBCT, and consolidation effects of MBCL at follow-up. METHODS: Part one is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing MBCL in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU alone. The primary outcome measure was severity of depressive symptoms. Possible mediators and moderators of treatment outcome were examined. Part two is an uncontrolled study of both intervention- and control group on the consolidation of treatment effect of MBCL over the course of a 6-months follow-up period. RESULTS: Patients were recruited between July 2013 and December 2014 (N = 122). MBCL participants (n = 61) showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.35), compared to those who only received TAU (n = 61). The results at 6-months follow-up showed a continued improvement of depressive symptoms. LIMITATIONS: As MBCL was not compared with an active control condition, we have little information about the possible effectiveness of non-specific factors. CONCLUSION: MBCL appears to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in a population suffering from severe, prolonged, recurrent depressive symptoms. To optimise the (sequential) treatment trajectory, replication of the study in a prospective sequential trial is needed. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT02059200.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Although patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors and their partners are at risk of experiencing high symptom burden, they are often excluded from psychosocial intervention studies. Thus, we sought to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a couple-based meditation (CBM) program targeting symptom and well-being outcomes. METHODS: Couples completed baseline measures assessing symptom and well-being outcomes and were randomized to the CBM or a usual care control group. Couples in the CBM groups attended four weekly (60 minutes each) therapist-led sessions that were delivered via FaceTime (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA). The CBM program focused on cultivating mindfulness, compassion, gratitude and purpose, and integrated emotional disclosure exercises. Both groups were reassessed six and 12 weeks after baseline. RESULTS: We approached 60 eligible dyads, of which 37 (62%) consented, 35 (95%) were randomized, and 22 (63%) completed all assessments. Couples in the CBM group attended a mean of 3.33 sessions (SD 1.09). For patients, significant group differences in favor of the CBM group were found for cognitive (d = 1.05) and general disease symptoms (d = 0.93), and relationship well-being (d = 0.68) and compassion (d = 0.96). No significant group differences were revealed for partners. CONCLUSION: It seems to be feasible, acceptable, and possibly efficacious to deliver a dyadic intervention via FaceTime to brain tumor couples. Although both patients and partners in the CBM group rated the intervention as beneficial, significant group differences with medium-to-large effect sizes were only found for patients.",

Mindfulness is the ability to focus on the present moment without evaluation. Findings on the effects of 8-week mindfulness trainings in patients with PS reveal positive effects on the severity of the disease and quality of life. However, it remained unclear what distinguishes patients with PS interested in psychological interventions from those without interest and whether also a shorter, namely 2-week mindfulness-based intervention is beneficial in this patient group. This will be investigated with this study. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Data will be collected at a rehabilitation clinic in Germany. The study is divided into two parts: study 1a is an observational study. Its aim is to investigate whether sociodemographic, skin-related and psychological factors are significant predictors of interest in a brief psychological intervention in 127 patients with PS.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of mindfulness-based sexual counseling (MBSC) on sexual distress, attitudes toward sexuality, and body image concerns in pregnant women. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a sample of women who experienced sexual distress presenting to a Healthy Living Center in eastern Turkey. Women (N = 134) were randomly assigned to receive a 4-week, 8-session counseling program based on mindfulness (experimental group; n = 67) or treatment as usual (control group; n = 67). The primary outcome of the study, sexual distress, was assessed using the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised. Secondary outcomes included attitude toward sexuality, assessed using the Attitude Scale toward Sexuality during Pregnancy, and body image concerns, using the Body Image Concerns during Pregnancy Scale. Outcomes were compared postintervention, correcting for baseline using analysis of covariance. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04900194). RESULTS: Mean scores for sexual distress (7.69 vs 17.36; P < .001) and body image concerns (57.76 vs 73.88; P < .001) decreased significantly in the mindfulness group compared with the control group. Similarly, mean scores for attitudes toward sexuality significantly improved in the mindfulness group compared with the control group (133.52 vs 105.78; P < .05). DISCUSSION: MBSC is a promising strategy to help women experiencing sexual distress during pregnancy to reduce their levels of sexual distress, raise their positive attitudes toward sexuality, and lower their body image concerns. Larger clinical trials of MBSC are recommended to support introduction of MBSC into clinical practice.",

        "title": "Effects of a mindfulness based childbirth and parenting program on pregnant women's perceived stress and risk of perinatal depression-Results from a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting Program (MBCP) in reducing pregnant women's perceived stress and preventing perinatal depression compared to an active control condition. METHOD: First time pregnant women (n = 197) at risk of perinatal depression were randomized to MBCP or an active control treatment, which consisted of a Lamaze childbirth class. At baseline and post-intervention, participants filled out questionnaires on perceived stress, depressive symptoms, positive states of mind, and five facets of mindfulness. RESULTS: Compared to the active control treatment, MBCP significantly reduced perceived stress (p = 0.038, d = 0.30) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.004, d = 0.42), and increased positive states of mind (p = 0.005, d = 0.41) and self-reported mindfulness (p = 0.039, d = 0.30). Moreover, change in mindfulness possibly mediated the treatment effects of MBCP on stress, depression symptoms, and positive states of mind. The subscales \"non-reactivity to inner experience\" and \"non-judging of experience\" seemed to have the strongest mediating effects. LIMITATIONS: The outcomes were self-report questionnaires, the participants were not blinded to treatment condition and the condition was confounded by number of sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MBCP is more effective in decreasing perceived stress and risk of perinatal depression compared to a Lamaze childbirth class. The results also contribute to our understanding of the underlying psychological mechanisms through which the reduction of stress and depression symptoms may operate. Thus, this study increases our knowledge about efficient intervention strategies to prevent perinatal depression and promote mental wellbeing among pregnant women.",

        "abstract": "Contemplative mental practices aim to enable individuals to develop greater awareness of their own cognitive and affective states through repeated examination of first-person experience. Recent cross-sectional studies of long-term meditation practitioners suggest that the subjective reports of such individuals are better calibrated with objective indices; however, the impact of mental training on metacognitive ability has not yet been examined in a randomized controlled investigation. The present study evaluated the impact of a 2-week meditation-training program on introspective accuracy in the domains of perception and memory. Compared with an active control group that elicited no change, we found that a 2-week meditation program significantly enhanced introspective accuracy, quantified by metacognitive judgments of cognition on a trial-by-trial basis, in a memory but not a perception domain. Together, these data suggest that, in at least some domains, the human capacity to introspect is plastic and can be enhanced through training.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The first years of school are critical in establishing a foundation for positive long-term academic, social and well-being outcomes. Mindfulness-based interventions may help students transition well into school, but few robust studies have been conducted in this age group. We aim to determine whether compared with controls, children who receive a mindfulness intervention within the first years of primary school have better: (1) immediate attention/short-term memory at 18 months post-randomisation (primary outcome); (2) inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility at 18 months post-randomisation; (3) socio-emotional well-being, emotion-regulation and mental health-related behaviours at 6 and 18 months post-randomisation; (4) sustained changes in teacher practice and classroom interactions at 18 months post-randomisation. Furthermore, we aim to determine whether the implementation predicts the efficacy of the intervention, and the cost effectiveness relative to outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 22 primary schools in disadvantaged areas of Melbourne, Australia. 826 students in the first year of primary school will be recruited to detect between groups differences of Cohen's d=0.25 at the 18-month follow-up. Parent, teacher and child-assessment measures of child attention, emotion-regulation, executive functioning, socio-emotional well-being, mental health-related behaviour and learning, parent mental well-being, teacher well-being will be collected 6 and 18 months post-randomisation. Implementation factors will be measured throughout the study. Intention-to-treat analyses, accounting for clustering within schools and classes, will adopt a two-level random effects linear regression model to examine outcomes for the intervention versus control students. Unadjusted and analyses adjusted for baseline scores, baseline age, gender and family socioeconomic status will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been received by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Melbourne. Findings will be reported in peer-review publications, national and international conference presentations and research snapshots directly provided to participating schools and families.

        "title": "How mindfulness changed my sleep: focus groups with chronic insomnia patients.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is a major public health problem affecting approximately 10% of adults. Use of meditation and yoga to develop mindful awareness ('mindfulness training') may be an effective approach to treat chronic insomnia, with sleep outcomes comparable to nightly use of prescription sedatives, but more durable and with minimal or no side effects. The purpose of this study was to understand mindfulness training as experienced by patients with chronic insomnia, and suggest procedures that may be useful in optimizing sleep benefits. METHODS: Adults (N = 18) who completed an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program as part of a randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia were invited to participate in post-trial focus groups. Two groups were held. Participants (n = 9) described how their sleep routine, thoughts and emotions were affected by MBSR and about utility (or not) of various mindfulness techniques. Groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: the impact of mindfulness on sleep and motivation to adopt a healthy sleep lifestyle; benefits of mindfulness on aspects of life beyond sleep; challenges and successes in adopting mindfulness-based practices; and the importance of group sharing and support. Participants said they were not sleeping more, but sleeping better, waking more refreshed, feeling less distressed about insomnia, and better able to cope when it occurred. Some participants experienced the course as a call to action, and for them, practicing meditation and following sleep hygiene guidelines became priorities. Motivation to sustain behavioral changes was reinforced by feeling physically better and more emotionally stable, and seeing others in the MBSR class improve. The body scan was identified as an effective tool to enable falling asleep faster. Participants described needing to continue practicing mindfulness to maintain benefits. CONCLUSIONS: First-person accounts are consistent with published trial results of positive impacts of MBSR on sleep measured by sleep diary, actigraphy, and self-report sleep scales. Findings indicate that mindfulness training in a group format, combined with sleep hygiene education, is important for effective application of MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

        "title": "Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions in High School and College Athletes for Reducing Stress and Injury, and Improving Quality of Life.",
        "abstract": "Clinical Scenario: Student athletes experience a variety of stressors from school and social activities, as well as the additional demands of sport participation. Mindfulness-based interventions can help increase mental awareness and acceptance, as well as mitigate negative thoughts and emotions. The use of mindfulness-based interventions may be beneficial for reducing thoughts of stress, injury reduction, and improving overall wellbeing. CLINICAL QUESTION: Does the use of mindfulness-based interventions for student-athletes aged 13-24 years reduce stress and injury as well as improve overall quality of life? SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The literature was searched for studies that investigated the use of mindfulness-based strategies for student-athletes specifically for reducing stress and injury and/or improving quality of life. The literature search returned 8 possible studies related to the clinical question and 3 studies met the inclusion criteria (1 randomized control trial, 2 nonrandomized control cohort studies). All 3 included studies demonstrated overall improved levels of mindfulness among student-athletes after the use of a mindfulness-based intervention. Mindfulness-based interventions had positive effects for reducing negative thoughts and levels of perceived stress. The number of injury occurrences were found to decrease following the integration of a mindfulness-based intervention within an athletic population. Clinical Bottom Line: There is sufficient evidence supporting the use of mindfulness-based interventions with student-athletes for increasing mindfulness, managing negative emotions and perceived stress, as well as improving overall well-being. There is also current literature that advocates the use of mindfulness-based interventions for reducing injury, but further research is needed for support. Strength of Recommendation: Grade B evidence exists to support that the use of mindfulness-based interventions for student-athletes will reduce stress and improve overall well-being as well as support the possibility that if a student-athlete is more mindful, it may help decrease risk of injury incurred if the student-athlete is under mental stress.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized wait-list controlled trial was to explore the effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on risk and protective factors for depressive relapse within the domains of cognition, emotion and self-relatedness. METHODS: Sixty-eight individuals with recurrent depressive disorder were randomized to MBCT or a wait-list control condition (WLC). RESULTS: Completers of MBCT (N = 26) improved significantly on measures assessing risk and protective factors of recurrent depression compared to WLC (N = 30) on measures of rumination (d = 0.59, p = .015), emotion regulation (d = 0.50, p = .028), emotional reactivity to stress (d = 0.32, p = .048), self-compassion (d = 1.02, p < .001), mindfulness (d = 0.59, p = .010), and depression (d = 0.40, p = .018). In the Intention To Treat sample, findings were attenuated, but there were still significant results on measures of rumination, self-compassion and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the present trial contribute to evidence that MBCT can lead to reduction in risk factors of depressive relapse, and strengthening of factors known to be protective of depressive relapse. The largest changes were found in the domain of self-relatedness, in the form of large effects on the participants' ability to be less self-judgmental and more self-compassionate.

METHODS: Seventy-three students (age = 25.76, std. dev = 3.10) with attention problems and/or learning disabilities were randomly assigned to three groups: mindfulness meditation, device guided breathing practice and waiting-list control. Before and after the intervention physiological and psychological measures were collected. RESULTS: Our results show that only mindfulness practice improved awareness of the present moment and decreased hyperactivity and inattention. Furthermore, both mindfulness and practice with device-guided breathing were associated with stress reduction, as shown by an increase in the galvanic skin response only in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the study results may lead to an advance in treating attention deficit disorders and learning disabilities, especially among higher education students.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether observed interactions of mindfulness with the personality trait neuroticism extend to older adults and to aspects of psychological functioning other than depressive symptoms, and whether effects of mindfulness training in this population depend on levels of neuroticism. METHOD: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for community-dwelling older adults. We investigated whether neuroticism moderates associations of dispositional mindfulness with various aspects of psychological and physical functioning at baseline, as well as effects of MBSR on these outcomes. RESULTS: Significant two-way interactions showed that greater mindfulness was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and less negative affect at baseline in individuals with average or higher levels of neuroticism. In contrast, mindfulness was associated with greater positive affect and vitality and fewer physical symptoms regardless of the level of neuroticism. There were no effects of MBSR on these outcomes at any level of neuroticism. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness may be more protective against psychological ill-being in older adults with higher levels of neuroticism, but conducive to positive psychological and physical well-being regardless of this personality trait. The potential moderating role of neuroticism should be further evaluated in studies of mindfulness-based interventions in older adults.",

We examined the effects of a breathing-based meditation intervention, Sudarshan Kriya yoga, on PTSD outcome variables in U.S. male veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan war. We randomly assigned 21 veterans to an active (n = 11) or waitlist control (n = 10) group. Laboratory measures of eye-blink startle and respiration rate were obtained before and after the intervention, as were self-report symptom measures; the latter were also obtained 1 month and 1 year later. The active group showed reductions in PTSD scores, d = 1.16, 95% CI [0.20, 2.04], anxiety symptoms, and respiration rate, but the control group did not. Reductions in startle correlated with reductions in hyperarousal symptoms immediately postintervention (r = .93, p < .001) and at 1-year follow-up (r = .77, p = .025). This longitudinal intervention study suggests there may be clinical utility for Sudarshan Kriya yoga for PTSD.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The demand for effective psychological treatments for depression, anxiety, and heightened stress is far outstripping their supply. Accordingly, internet delivered, self-help interventions offer hope to many people, as they can be easily accessed and at a fraction of the price of face-to-face options. Mindfulness and self-compassion are particularly exciting approaches, as evidence suggests interventions that cultivate these skills are effective in reducing depression, anxiety, and heightened stress. We examined the effectiveness of a newly developed program that combines mindfulness, self-compassion, and goal-setting exercises into a brief self-guided intervention (Mind-OP). The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a randomized-controlled trial entirely on a popular crowdsourcing platform, Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). METHODS: We randomized 456 participants reporting heightened depression, anxiety, or stress to one of two conditions: the 4-week Mind-OP intervention (n = 227) or to an active control condition (n = 229) where participants watched nature videos superimposed onto relaxing meditation music for four consecutive weeks. We administered measures of anxiety, depression, perceived stress, dispositional and state mindfulness, self-compassion, and nonattachment. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses revealed that, compared to participants in the control condition, participants in the Mind-OP intervention condition reported significantly less anxiety and stress at the end of the trial, as well as significantly greater mindfulness, self-compassion, and nonattachment. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-OP appears effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and perceived stress among MTurk participants.

METHOD: Between February 2011 and May 2014, the authors conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial of clerkships as usual (CAU) and clerkships with additional MBSR in medical students during their first year of clinical clerkships at a Dutch university medical center. MBSR consisted of eight weekly two-hour sessions, comprising didactic teaching, meditation exercises, and group dialogues. Students completed online assessments at baseline and after 3, 7, 12, 15, and 20 months. Outcome measures were psychological distress, positive mental health, life satisfaction, physician empathy, mindfulness skills, and dysfunctional cognitions as measured by validated tools. RESULTS: Of 232 eligible students, 167 students (72%) participated and were randomized by clerkship group into MBSR (n = 83) or CAU (n = 84). The MBSR group reported a small reduction of psychological distress (P = .03, Cohen's d = 0.20) and dysfunctional cognitions (P = .05, Cohen's d = 0.18) and a moderate increase of positive mental health (P = .002, Cohen's d = 0.44), life satisfaction (P = .01, Cohen's d = 0.51), and mindfulness skills (P = .05, Cohen's d = 0.35) compared with CAU during the 20-month follow-up. The authors detected no significant effect on physician empathy (P = .18, Cohen's d = 0.27).

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to be an effective psychological intervention for reducing depressive symptoms in a range of populations. MBCT is traditionally given in a group format. The aim of the current pilot RCT was to examine the effects of group-based MBCT and individually based MBCT for reducing depressive symptoms in adults suffering from one or more somatic diseases. In this study, 56 people with a somatic condition and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II] \u226514) were randomized to group MBCT (n = 28) or individual MBCT (n = 28). Patients filled out questionnaires at three points in time (i.e., pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 months follow-up). Primary outcome measure was severity of depressive symptoms. Anxiety and positive well-being as well as mindfulness and self-compassion were also assessed. We found significant improvements in all outcomes in those receiving group or individual MBCT, with no significant differences between the two conditions regarding these improvements. Although preliminary (given the pilot nature and lack of control group), results suggest that both group MBCT and individual MBCT are associated with improvements in psychological well-being and enhanced skills of mindfulness and self-compassion in individuals with a chronic somatic condition and comorbid depressive symptoms. Our findings merit future non-inferiority trials in larger samples to be able to draw more firm conclusions about the effectiveness of both formats of MBCT.",

METHODS: After giving informed consent, 121 women needing percutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy were randomized into three groups: (1) guided meditation; (2) music; (3) standard-care control group. During biopsy, the meditation and music groups listened to an audio-recorded, guided, loving-kindness meditation and relaxing music, respectively; the standard-care control group received supportive dialogue from the biopsy team. Immediately before and after biopsy, participants completed questionnaires measuring anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale), biopsy pain (Brief Pain Inventory), and fatigue (modified Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue). After biopsy, participants completed questionnaires assessing radiologist-patient communication (modified Questionnaire on the Quality of Physician-Patient Interaction), demographics, and medical history. RESULTS: The meditation and music groups reported significantly greater anxiety reduction (P values < .05) and reduced fatigue after biopsy than the standard-care control group; the standard-care control group reported increased fatigue after biopsy. The meditation group additionally showed significantly lower pain during biopsy, compared with the music group (P = .03). No significant difference in patient-perceived quality of radiologist-patient communication was noted among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Listening to guided meditation significantly lowered biopsy pain during imaging-guided breast biopsy; meditation and music reduced patient anxiety and fatigue without compromising radiologist-patient communication.

        "title": "Attachment-based compassion therapy and adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction for the treatment of depressive, anxious and adjustment disorders in mental health settings: a randomised controlled clinical trial protocol.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders are highly prevalent among mental health outpatients. The lack of funding for mental health problems produces inefficient results and a high burden of disease. New cost-effective group interventions aimed at treating these symptoms might be an appropriate solution to reduce the healthcare burden in mental health units. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown significant reductions in anxious, depressive and adjustment symptomatology. Recent research highlights the influence of compassion as a key mechanism of change. However, MBIs only address compassion implicitly, whereas compassion-based protocols consider it a core aspect of psychotherapy. In this randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that the provision of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT), which is a compassion-based protocol, will be more effective than mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which is a conventional MBI programme, for the treatment of depressive, anxious and adaptive symptoms in patients in mental health settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Approximately 90 patients suffering from depressive, anxious or adjustment disorders recruited from Spanish mental health settings will be randomised to receive 8 weekly 2 hours group sessions of ABCT, 8 weekly 2.5 hours group sessions of adapted MBSR (with no full-day silent retreat) or treatment as usual (TAU), with a 1:1:1 allocation rate. Patients in the ABCT and adapted MBSR groups will also receive TAU. The main outcome will be general affective distress measured by means of the 'Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21' at post-test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be quality of life, mindfulness, self-compassion and the use of healthcare services. There will be a 6-month follow-up assessment. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted using linear mixed models. Per-protocol and secondary outcome analyses will be performed. A data monitoring committee comprising the trial manager, the ABCT and MBSR teachers and an independent clinical psychologist will monitor for possible negative side effects.

        "title": "Effectiveness of a brief psychological mindfulness-based intervention for the treatment of depression in primary care: study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are quite prevalent in Primary Care (PC) settings. The treatment as usual (TAU) in PC is pharmacotherapy, despite the high relapse rates it produces. Many patients would prefer psychotherapy, but specialized services are overloaded. Studies that apply Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) for the treatment of depression have obtained significant improvements. Brief low-intensity approaches delivered from PC could be a promising approach. This study aims to compare a low-intensity mindfulness intervention for the treatment of depression in PC using different intervention formats - a face-to-face MBI delivered in a group and the same MBI individually applied on the Internet - to a control group that will receive PC medical treatment as usual. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in PC, with about 120 depressed patients allocated (1:1:1) to three groups: \"face-to-face MBI + TAU\", \"Internet-delivered MBI + TAU\", and \"TAU alone\". The MBI programs will be composed of four modules. The primary outcome will be depressive symptoms, measured through the Beck Depression Inventory, assessed at pre- and post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Other outcomes will be mindfulness, happiness, affectivity, quality of life, and the use of healthcare services. Intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores and routine sociodemographic analysis that could show baseline differences will be conducted. Per-protocol secondary outcome analyses will also be performed. DISCUSSION: This is the first Spanish RCT to apply a low-intensity face-to-face MBI (plus TAU) to treat depression in PC settings compared to TAU (alone). Moreover, this study will also make it possible to evaluate the same MBI program (plus TAU), but Internet-delivered, considering their cost-effectiveness. Positive results from this RCT might have an important impact on mental health settings, helping to decrease the overload of the system and offering treatment alternatives beyond antidepressant medication through high-quality, flexible PC interventions.

The purpose of the present pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention in breast-feeding mothers. We developed and tested an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention aimed at improving maternal self-efficacy, mindfulness, self-compassion, satisfaction with life, and subjective happiness, and at reducing psychological distress. A randomized controlled, between-groups design was used with treatment and control groups (n = 26) and pretest and posttest measures. ANCOVA results indicated that, compared to the control group, mothers in the treatment group scored significantly higher on maternal self-efficacy, some dimensions of mindfulness (observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity), and self-compassion (self-kindness, mindfulness, over-identification, and total self-compassion). In addition, mothers who received the treatment exhibited significantly less anxiety, stress, and psychological distress. The results supported previous research findings about the benefits of mindfulness-based intervention in women from the perinatal and postpartum periods through the early parenting period. Additional research is needed to validate our findings in non-breast-feeding mothers and to examine the intervention's indirect benefits in terms of family relationships and child development.",

        "title": "Study protocol for a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial of SKY breathing meditation versus cognitive processing therapy for PTSD among veterans.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating, highly prevalent condition. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend trauma-focused psychotherapy (eg, cognitive processing therapy; CPT) as the first-line treatment for PTSD. However, while these treatments show clinically meaningful symptom improvement, the majority of those who begin treatment retain a diagnosis of PTSD post-treatment. Perhaps for this reason, many individuals with PTSD have sought more holistic, mind-body, complementary and integrative health (CIH) interventions. However, there remains a paucity of high-quality, active controlled efficacy studies of CIH interventions for PTSD, which precludes their formal recommendation. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We present the protocol for an ongoing non-inferiority parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of a breathing meditation intervention (Sudarshan Kriya Yoga [SKY]) to a recommended evidence-based psychotherapy (CPT) for PTSD among veterans. Assessors are blinded to treatment group. The primary outcome measure is the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and a combination of clinical, self-report, experimental and physiological outcome measures assess treatment-related changes across each of the four PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions or mood and hyperarousal/reactivity). Once the RCT is completed, analyses will use both an intent-to-treat (using the 'last observation carried forward' for missing data) and a per-protocol or 'treatment completers' procedure, which is the most rigorous approach to non-inferiority designs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: To the best of our knowledge, this is this first non-inferiority RCT of SKY versus CPT for PTSD among veterans. The protocol is approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Results from this RCT will inform future studies including larger multi-site efficacy RCTs of SKY for PTSD and other mental health conditions, as well as exploration of cost-effectiveness and evaluation of implementation issues.

        "title": "A pilot randomised trial comparing a mindfulness-based stress reduction course, a locally-developed stress reduction intervention and a waiting list control group in a real-life municipal health care setting.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to lend support to a larger effectiveness RCT comparing Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a locally-developed stress reduction intervention (LSR) and a waiting list control group in a Danish municipal health care center setting. METHODS: A three-armed parallel pilot RCT was conducted among 71 adults who contacted a Danish municipal health care center due to stress-related problems. Recruitment was made between January and April 2018 and followed usual procedures. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) acute treatment-demanding clinical depression or diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia, 2) abuse of alcohol, drugs, medicine, 3) pregnancy. Randomisation was performed by an independent data manager using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The primary outcome was a description of RCT feasibility (recruitment and retention rates regarding intervention participation and 12-week follow-up). Secondary outcomes were completion rates regarding questionnaire data and proposed effect-estimates of outcome measures considered to be used in the following real RCT. Type of intervention and outcome assessment were not blinded. RESULTS: We recruited 71 of 129 eligible individuals from the target population (55, 95%CI: 46-64). Forty-two (59%) were females. Median age: 44 years (1-quartile:34, 3-quartile:50). Twenty-nine (41%) had < 16 years of education. Forty-eight (68%) were employed; 30 of these 48 (63%) were on sick leave. Mean scores for perceived stress (PSS): 25.4 \u00b1 5.3; symptoms of anxiety and depression (SCL-5): 2.9 \u00b1 0.6, and well-being (WHO-5): 31.7 \u00b1 8.5 indicated a need for intervention. 16/24 (67, 95%CI: 45 to 84) who were allocated to MBSR and 17/23 (74, 95%CI: 52 to 90) who were allocated to LSR participated in \u22655 sessions. The loss to follow-up at 12 weeks: MBSR: 5 (21% (95% CI: 7 to 42), LSR: 5 (22% (95% CI: 7 to 44) and waiting list: 4 (17% (95% CI: 5 to 37). This was acceptable and evenly distributed. The results indicated MBSR to be superior. CONCLUSIONS: An RCT assessing the effectiveness of stress reduction interventions in a real-life municipal health care setting is feasible among adults with a clear need for stress reduction interventions based on scores on mental health.

        "title": "Divergent effects of brief contemplative practices in response to an acute stressor: A randomized controlled trial of brief breath awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude or an attention control practice.",
        "abstract": "Mindfulness practices are increasingly being utilized as a method for cultivating well-being. The term mindfulness is often used as an umbrella for a variety of different practices and many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) contain multiple styles of practice. Despite the diversity of practices within MBIs, few studies have investigated whether constituent practices produce specific effects. We randomized 156 undergraduates to one of four brief practices: breath awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude, or to an attention control condition. We assessed practice effects on affect following brief training, and effects on affect and behavior after provocation with a stressor (i.e., Cold pressor test). Results indicate that gratitude training significantly improved positive affect compared to breath awareness (d = 0.58) and loving-kindness led to significantly greater reductions in implicit negative affect compared to the control condition (d = 0.59) immediately after brief practice. In spite of gains in positive affect, the gratitude group demonstrated increased reactivity to the stressor, reporting the CPT as significantly more aversive than the control condition (d = 0.46) and showing significantly greater increases in negative affect compared to the breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, respectively). Greater gains in implicit positive affect following gratitude training predicted decreased post-stressor likability ratings of novel neutral faces compared to breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = - 0.39, -0.40, -0.33, respectively) as well. Moreover, the gratitude group was significantly less likely to donate time than the loving-kindness group in an ecologically valid opportunity to provide unrewarded support. These data suggest that different styles of contemplative practice may produce different effects in the context of brief, introductory practice and these differences may be heightened by stress. Implications for the study of contemplative practices are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study assessed the potential effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of a tailored mindfulness-based intervention (MBI, REMIND 2.0) for personal recovery among people with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this pilot mixed methods randomized controlled trial, participants were assigned to either the MBI (n = 14) or the relaxation training (RT) (n = 14). Quantitative measures were used to assess primary outcomes, including personal recovery, mindfulness, self-compassion, resilience, and secondary outcomes, including depression, stress, anxiety, positive and negative moods, quality of life and general health at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and one-month follow-up (T2). Quantitative interviews were conducted to explore the experiences and perceptions toward the MBI. RESULTS: Results indicated significant group and time interactions for all outcomes except anxiety and stress. MBI participants showed significant improvements in all outcomes at T1, which were maintained at T2, except for positive mood. RT participants showed a significant decline in resilience but significant improvements in all secondary outcomes at T1, but all outcomes significantly declined at T2, except for anxiety and stress. MBI participants were receptive toward the programme in all aspects of personal recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The tailored MBI is a potentially effective, feasible and acceptable approach to facilitate personal recovery among people with mental illness. Differences between MBI and RT are discussed.",

In contrast, self-compassion can contribute to the resilience and recovery of clinical populations, making this an important target for treatment. Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to improve existing interventions as it allows for personalized roleplays that can be experienced from different perspectives, by using the novel VR technique of perspective change. We investigated the effects of a VR intervention on self-criticism and self-compassion, and the added value of changing perspectives. In total, 68 undergraduate students with high levels of self-criticism were randomized to either the perspective change condition or the control condition. Participants played two roleplays in which they had to react compassionately toward a virtual character that expressed the participants' own self-critical thoughts. In the perspective change condition, after each roleplay perspective change was used to receive one's own compassionate words. Results showed that self-compassion increased and self-criticism decreased significantly in both conditions. No significant differences were found for negative and positive affect. Furthermore, no differences were found between the conditions. Thus, receiving compassionate words through perspective change had no additional effect. Expressing compassion to someone with similar self-criticism showed to be sufficient to reduce self-criticism and increase self-compassion.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine has emerged as a popular evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, psychosocial stress, anxiety, pain, and co-morbid substance use increase patients' risk for relapse. We designed this study to compare the effects of complementing buprenorphine treatment with 24 weeks of a live-online Mindful Recovery Opioid Care Continuum (M-ROCC) group to a time and attention-matched, live-online Recovery Support Group (RSG) active control condition. METHODS: We plan to enroll a maximum of N = 280 and randomize at least N = 192 patients prescribed buprenorphine through referrals from office-based and telemedicine buprenorphine treatment providers and social media advertisements. Participants will be randomly assigned to M-ROCC or RSG and will be blinded to their treatment condition. The primary outcome for this study will be biochemically confirmed periods of abstinence from illicit opioids, as measured by self-reported use and randomly collected, video-observed oral fluid toxicology testing during the final 12 weeks of study participation. Secondary outcomes include changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) anxiety and pain interference scores between baseline and week 24. RESULTS: The trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health, HEAL Initiative through NCCIH (R33AT010125). Data collection is projected to end by September 2023, and we expect publication of results in 2024. CONCLUSION: If the M-ROCC intervention is found to be effective in this format, it will demonstrate that live-online mindfulness groups can improve outcomes and address common co-morbidities like anxiety and pain during buprenorphine treatment.",

        "abstract": "Sleep problems are prevalent among older adults, often persist untreated, and are predictive of health detriments. Given the limitations of conventional treatments, non-pharmacological treatments such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are gaining popularity for sleep ailments. However, nothing is yet known about the impact of MBIs on sleep in older adults with prodromal sleep disturbances. This article details the design and methodology of a 6-week parallel-group RCT calibrated to test the treatment effect of the Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) program versus sleep hygiene education for improving sleep quality, as the main outcome, in older adults with prodromal sleep disturbances. Older adults with current sleep disturbances will be recruited from the urban Los Angeles community. Participants will be randomized into two standardized treatment conditions, MAPs and sleep hygiene education. Each condition will consist of weekly 2-hour group-based classes over the course of the 6-week intervention. The primary objective of this study is to determine if mindfulness meditation practice as engaged through the MAPs program leads to improved sleep quality relative to sleep hygiene education in older adults with prodromal sleep disturbances.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation is a set of attention-based, regulatory, and self-inquiry training regimes. Although the impact of mindfulness training (MT) on self-regulation is well established, the neural mechanisms supporting such plasticity are poorly understood. MT is thought to act through interoceptive salience and attentional control mechanisms, but until now conflicting evidence from behavioral and neural measures renders difficult distinguishing their respective roles. To resolve this question we conducted a fully randomized 6 week longitudinal trial of MT, explicitly controlling for cognitive and treatment effects with an active-control group. We measured behavioral metacognition and whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals using functional MRI during an affective Stroop task before and after intervention in healthy human subjects. Although both groups improved significantly on a response-inhibition task, only the MT group showed reduced affective Stroop conflict. Moreover, the MT group displayed greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses during executive processing, consistent with increased recruitment of top-down mechanisms to resolve conflict. In contrast, we did not observe overall group-by-time interactions on negative affect-related reaction times or BOLD responses. However, only participants with the greatest amount of MT practice showed improvements in response inhibition and increased recruitment of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior insula during negative valence processing. Our findings highlight the importance of active control in MT research, indicate unique neural mechanisms for progressive stages of mindfulness training, and suggest that optimal application of MT may differ depending on context, contrary to a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Both heart rate variability-biofeedback (HRV-Bfb) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been empirically shown to reduce stress. This study compares these two interventions in the work context to a wait-list-control-group (WLC). In this three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT), 69 healthy adults employed in the same organization were randomized to participate in HRV-Bfb, MBI or the WLC. Participants were assessed for psychophysiological parameters of stress (stress perception, coping, HRV parameters and cortisol) and stress related symptoms (depressive symptoms, psychological wellbeing, mindfulness and self-compassion). Participants trained using either HRV-Bfb or MBI for 6 weeks on a daily basis. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after the intervention and at follow-up 12 weeks later. Results did not show any statistically significant differences between HRV-Bfb and MBI groups, and neither of the intervention groups (IGs) differed from the WLC. Findings suggest an overall reduction in stress for all groups, including the WLC, with mostly small to medium effect sizes. However, it is important to note that participants with higher baseline stress levels might benefit more from mindfulness and biofeedback-based stress reduction interventions. The results have to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small sample size. MBI might have a slightly stronger effect on stress reduction in comparison to HRV-Bfb, as suggested by the effect sizes. This study highlights issues and challenges of the implementation of such interventions in corporate health management.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest psychological benefits associated with meditation training delivered via mobile health. However, research in this area has primarily focused on mindfulness, only one of many meditative techniques. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of 2 versions of a self-guided, smartphone-based meditation app-the Healthy Minds Program (HMP)-which includes training in mindfulness (Awareness), along with practices designed to cultivate positive relationships (Connection) or insight into the nature of the self (Insight). METHODS: A three-arm, fully remote RCT compared 8 weeks of one of 2 HMP conditions (Awareness+Connection and Awareness+Insight) with a waitlist control. Adults (\u226518 years) without extensive previous meditation experience were eligible. The primary outcome was psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress). Secondary outcomes were social connection, empathy, compassion, self-reflection, insight, rumination, defusion, and mindfulness. Measures were completed at pretest, midtreatment, and posttest between October 2019 and April 2020. Longitudinal data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles with maximum likelihood. RESULTS: A total of 343 participants were randomized and 186 (54.2%) completed at least one posttest assessment. The majority (166/228, 72.8%) of those assigned to HMP conditions downloaded the app. The 2 HMP conditions did not differ from one another in terms of changes in any outcome. Relative to the waitlist control, the HMP conditions showed larger improvements in distress, social connectedness, mindfulness, and measures theoretically linked to insight training (d=-0.28 to 0.41; Ps<=.02), despite modest exposure to connection- and insight-related practice. The results were robust to some assumptions about nonrandom patterns of missing data. Improvements in distress were associated with days of use. Candidate mediators (social connection, insight, rumination, defusion, and mindfulness) and moderators (baseline rumination, defusion, and empathy) of changes in distress were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence of efficacy for the HMP app in reducing distress and improving outcomes related to well-being, including social connectedness. Future studies should attempt to increase study retention and user engagement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04139005; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04139005.",

METHODS: The meditation protocol consisted of Anapana (observing normal respiration) and Yoga Nidra (supine, restful awareness). In a single-blind randomised controlled trial, medicated and clinically stable outpatients diagnosed with SZ were randomised to receive treatment as usual (TAU), TAU augmented with YT or TAU augmented with meditation and yoga training (MYT) for 3 weeks (N = 145). Acceptability, clinical, social and cognitive functions were assessed after 3-week and 3-month post-randomisation using within-group and between-group analyses with repeated measures multivariate tests. RESULTS: No group-wise differences in compliance, study discontinuation, major/serious side effects or adverse events were noted. For six assessed clinical variables, the direction of changes were in the desired direction and the effect sizes were greater in the MYT group compared with the TAU group at both time points. Changes in social function variables were greater at 3 months than at 3 weeks. Nominally significant improvement in individual cognitive domains were noted in all groups at both time points. All effect sizes were in the small to medium range. CONCLUSION: MYT is feasible and acceptable and shows modest benefits for persons with SZ. MYT can also improve quality of life and clinical symptoms. Larger studies of longer duration are warranted.",

        "abstract": "To address the challenge of predicting psychological response to a psychosocial intervention we tested the possibility that baseline gene expression profiles might provide information above and beyond baseline psychometric measures. The genomics strategy utilized individual level inferences of transcription factor activity to predict changes in loneliness and affect in response to two well-established meditation interventions. Initial algorithm development analyses focused on three a-priori defined stress-related gene regulation pathways (CREB, GR, and NF-\u0138B) as inferred from TELiS promoter-based bioinformatic analysis of basal (pre-intervention) blood samples from a randomized-controlled trial comparing a compassion-based meditation (CM, n = 45) with mindfulness meditation (MM, n = 44). Greater baseline CREB activity (but not GR or NF-\u0138B) predicted greater reductions from pre- to post-intervention in loneliness (b = -0.24, p = 0.016) and negative emotions (b = -0.23, p = 0.017) for CM, but not for MM. A second algorithm validation analysis applied the same approach to another randomized controlled trial comparing CM (n = 42) with MM (n = 38) and a health education control condition (n = 41). Similarly, greater baseline CREB activity predicted greater pre- to post-intervention decreases in loneliness (b = -0.24, p = 0.029) and greater increases in satisfaction with life (b = 0.21, p = 0.046) for the CM condition only. Baseline CREB activity was not associated with baseline psychometric measures in either study. Results raise the possibility that pre-intervention gene expression profiles may reflect non-conscious psychobiological states that affect psychological responses to distinct psychosocial interventions, and thereby help personalize intervention selection.",

        "title": "Meditating on psychedelics. A randomized placebo-controlled study of DMT and harmine in a mindfulness retreat.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years, both meditation and psychedelics have attracted rapidly increasing scientific interest. While the current state of evidence suggests the promising potential of psychedelics, such as psilocybin, to enhance meditative training, it remains equivocal whether these effects are specifically bound to psilocybin or if other classical psychedelics might show synergistic effects with meditation practice. One particularly promising candidate is N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an active ingredient of ayahuasca. AIM: This study aims to investigate the effect of the psychedelic substance DMT, combined with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor harmine (DMT-harmine), on meditative states, compared to meditation with a placebo. METHOD: Forty experienced meditators (18 females and 22 males) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study over a 3-day meditation retreat, receiving either placebo or DMT-harmine. Participants' levels of mindfulness, compassion, insight, and transcendence were assessed before, during, and after the meditation group retreat, using psychometric questionnaires. RESULTS: Compared to meditation with a placebo, meditators who received DMT and harmine self-attributed greater levels of mystical-type experiences, non-dual awareness, and emotional breakthrough during the acute substance effects and, when corrected for baseline differences, greater psychological insight 1 day later. Mindfulness and compassion were not significantly different in the DMT-harmine group compared to placebo. At 1-month follow-up, the meditators who received DMT and harmine rated their experience as significantly more personally meaningful, spiritually significant, and well-being-enhancing than the meditators who received placebo. CONCLUSION: Investigating the impact of DMT-harmine on meditators in a naturalistic mindfulness group retreat, this placebo-controlled study highlights the specific effects of psychedelics during meditation.

Design: This study is a secondary analysis of pre/post data collected as part of a larger randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT). Subjects: This secondary analysis comprises pre/post data from 28 LEOs recruited from a metropolitan area and its outlying regions in the Pacific Northwest. Intervention: MBRT is a MBI tailored specifically to the culture and needs of LEOs and other first responders. Outcome measures: All included data were obtained through self-report measures. Mindfulness was assessed by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form, self-compassion was assessed by the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, psychological flexibility was assessed by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, alcohol use was measured by the PROMIS((R)) (v1.0) Alcohol Use-Short Form, and burnout was assessed by the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Results: In the first regression, only increases in mindfulness significantly predicted decreased postintervention problematic alcohol use. In the second regression, only increases in self-compassion significantly predicted decreased postintervention burnout. Conclusions: This study builds upon a growing body of literature on the relative impact of mindfulness, self-compassion, and psychological flexibility in predicting outcomes among high-stress cohorts.

Compared to attention (placebo) and no-training control conditions, brief self-compassion training diminished sympathetic (salivary alpha-amylase), cardiac parasympathetic, and subjective anxiety responses, though not HPA-axis (salivary cortisol) responses to the TSST. Self-compassion training also led to greater self-compassion under threat relative to the control groups.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high burden of depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n = 24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression. DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes. RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC. DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological traits. Neuroimaging results suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with an emotion regulation network might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.",

Children self-reported their mindfulness skills (i.e., dispositional mindfulness and psychological inflexibility) and well-being (i.e., anxiety and life satisfaction) and teachers evaluated children's social-emotional competence (i.e., emotion regulation, peer-relationship problems, and prosociality), well-being (i.e., emotional symptoms), and academic competence (i.e., student engagement and academic achievement). Mindfulness skills and emotional regulation were examined as potential mediators. Results revealed that children who received the MBI, compared to children in the WLC-group, improved their mindfulness skills, emotion regulation, prosociality, and emotional and behavioral engagement and decreased anxiety and peer-relationship problems. Positive changes in dispositional mindfulness led to reductions in children's anxiety and psychological inflexibility. Positive changes in emotional regulation led to improvements in prosociality and student engagement and decreased peer-relationships problems and emotional symptoms. Therefore, the results showed that a brief-MBI integrated in the Spanish regular school curriculum enhanced children's socio-emotional and academic development. Dispositional mindfulness and emotion regulation work as processes of change that underlie the intervention's impact.",

        "title": "The Effects of Tai Chi on Cardiovascular Risk in Women.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of tai chi (TC) on biobehavioral factors associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women. DESIGN: A randomized trial used a wait-list control group, pretest-posttest design. Data were collected immediately before, immediately after, and 2 months following the intervention. SETTING: The study was community based in central Virginia. SUBJECTS: Women aged 35 to 50 years at increased risk for CVD. INTERVENTION: The 8-week intervention built on prior work and was designed to impact biobehavioral factors associated with CVD risk in women. MEASURES: Biological measures included fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids as well as C-reactive protein and cytokines. Behavioral measures included fatigue, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, social support, mindfulness, self-compassion, and spiritual thoughts and behaviors. ANALYSIS: A mixed effects linear model was used to test for differences between groups across time. RESULTS: In 63 women, TC was shown to decrease fatigue (\u2202 [difference in group means] = 9.38, p = .001) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\u2202 = 12.61, p = .052). Consistent with the study model and intervention design, significant changes observed 2 months post intervention indicated that TC may help down-regulate proinflammatory cytokines associated with underlying CVD risk, including interferon gamma (\u2202 = 149.90, p = .002), tumor necrosis factor (\u2202 = 16.78, p = .002), interleukin (IL) 8 (\u2202 = 6.47, p = .026), and IL-4 (\u2202 = 2.13, p = .001), and may increase mindfulness (\u2202 = .54, p = .021), spiritual thoughts and behaviors (\u2202 = 8.30, p = .009), and self-compassion (\u2202 = .44, p = .045). CONCLUSION: This study contributes important insights into the potential benefits and mechanisms of TC and, with further research, may ultimately lead to effective strategies for reducing CVD risk in women earlier in the CVD trajectory.",

        "title": "A compassion-based treatment for couples with the female partner suffering from current depressive disorder: A randomized-controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that depression and interpersonal relationships are interdependently connected and that including the intimate partner in treatment for depression has beneficial effects. Given evidence that compassion is both an interpersonal quality and a promising treatment target, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of a compassion-based, contemplative treatment for couples employing a multi-method approach for evaluation. METHODS: In a pre-post-follow-up design, n = 53 different-sex couples including women with current depression were randomly assigned to a 10-week-long CBCT(R)-fC (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training/intervention for couples) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Multi-level linear regression models and post-hoc contrasts were calculated to determine changes in depressive symptoms, mindfulness and self-compassion, interpersonal functioning and neuroendocrine markers collected during a partnership appreciation task (PAT) in the laboratory before and after CBCT-fC treatment. RESULTS: While CBCT-fC led to a comparable decrease of depressive symptoms as TAU, the training specifically increased self-compassion and mindfulness versus TAU. Interestingly, interpersonal functioning did not improve, which was also reflected in participants' preferred self-focus in-between-session practices, instead of practices with interpersonal focus. There were no group-specific changes in psychobiological stress-marker reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: CBCT-fC was effective in decreasing current depressive symptomatology and increasing mindfulness, and self-compassion. Especially the motivation to participate, such as improving interpersonal functioning, should be addressed and intrinsic motives of the partners to be involved. In highly burdened individuals, self-regulation may need to be improved before co-regulation can be addressed, which would requiring longer treatments. Facilitating factors for engaging in the practice between-sessions seem meaningful.",

        "title": "The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Association Between Autonomic Interoceptive Signals and Emotion Regulation Selection.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The ability to select the most adaptive regulatory strategy as a function of the emotional context plays a pivotal role in psychological health. Recently, we showed that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can improve the sensitivity of regulatory strategy selection to emotional intensity. However, the mechanisms underlying this improvement are unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that MBIs support adaptive regulatory selection by increasing sensitivity to interoceptive signals associated with the emotional stimuli. METHODS: Participants (n = 84, mean [standard deviation {SD}] age = 30.9 [8.3] years; 54% women) were randomized to either a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program or a wait-list control condition. Before and after the MBSR program, physiological measures for autonomic nervous system activity were obtained, and participants performed a task examining emotion regulation selections (reappraisal versus distraction) when confronted with low or high negative intensity images. They also completed a battery of mindfulness, interoception, and well-being self-report measures. A cross-classified model was used for the main analyses. RESULTS: The participants assigned to the MBSR were overall more likely to choose reappraisal than distraction (b = 0.26, posterior SD = 0.13, 95confidence interval = 0.02-0.52) after the program. Interoceptive signals in response to negative images were associated with subsequent regulatory selections (b = 0.02, posterior SD = 0.01, 95% confidence interval = 0.01-0.03) in the MBSR group. Specifically, lower cardiac reactivity was associated with the choice to reappraise, whereas higher cardiac reactivity was related to the choice to distract. Greater differences in cardiac reactivity between states that prompt reappraisal and states that prompt distraction were associated with higher well-being (Satisfaction With Life Scale, Pearson r (29) = 0.527, p = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness seems to increase the sensitivity of regulatory selections to interoceptive signals, and this is associated with subjective well-being. This may be a central pathway through which MBIs exert their positive effects on mental health and resilience.",

        "abstract": "The Mindfulness to Meaning Theory provides a detailed process model of the mechanisms by which mindfulness may promote well-being. Central to the Mindfulness to Meaning Theory is the mindful reappraisal hypothesis (MRH), which suggests mindfulness training promotes well-being by facilitating positive reappraisal. Emerging evidence from interconnected domains of research supports the MRH. However, it remains unclear whether mindful reappraisal continues to develop after a mindfulness training course and whether this continued development encourages well-being over time. As such, this randomized controlled study compared participants receiving a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course with participants receiving no mindfulness training on positive reappraisal use and well-being over the course of 6 years. Latent growth curve modeling revealed that mindfulness training increased well-being by significantly increasing the trajectory of positive reappraisal over time. The MRH was then unpacked by examining whether MBSR also stimulated decentering and broadened awareness, core components of the MRH. Multivariate path analysis revealed that mindfulness training increased decentering, which in turn broadened awareness, which was then associated with positive reappraisal, ultimately promoting well-being. Taken together, these findings suggest that MBSR cultivates a downstream cascade of adaptive psychological processes that continue to promote quality of life 6-years after mindfulness training.",

        "title": "MinT-trial: Mindfulness versus cognitive behavioural therapy in Tinnitus patients: protocol for a randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic subjective tinnitus is a condition that affects 5.1% to 42.7% of the population, depending on the definition and studied population. Evidence-based treatment options are limited. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been proven effective to improve quality of life and to diminish tinnitus distress. Positive short-term effects of mindfulness-based interventions on tinnitus distress have been reported; however, the longer term effects remain to be studied. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We designed a monocentre randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and CBT in chronic tinnitus patients. Fifty-four patients (\u226532 on the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), suffering from tinnitus for at least 6 months) will be included in the trial and randomised into one of two intervention groups. One group will receive MBCT, the other group will receive CBT. Our primary objective is to determine whether MBCT is non-inferior to (as good as) CBT on tinnitus distress (TFI) in chronic tinnitus patients at 12 months follow-up after end of therapy. Non-inferiority will be declared if the mean decrease in TFI score for MBCT is no worse than the mean decrease in TFI score in CBT, with statistical variability, with a margin of 13 points. Most secondary objectives (tinnitus severity of problem, tinnitus intrusiveness, quality of life, anxiety, depression, symptoms of psychopathology, perceived tinnitus complaints, coping style (mostly validated questionnaires)) are expected to show non-inferiority to MBCT compared with CBT. We expect a significant difference between MBCT and CBT for mindfulness awareness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the UMC Utrecht (NL67838.041.18, V.4, April 2019). The trial results will be made accessible to the public in a peer-review journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NL7745.",

        "title": "Multiphase optimization of a multicomponent intervention for informal dementia caregivers: a study protocol.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Family caregiver interventions are essential to support dementia caregiving. However, such interventions are typically complex and consist of multiple components. Existing evidence rarely delineates the effectiveness and interactions between individual components. To optimise intervention, we adopt the multiphase optimisation strategy (MOST) to test the implementation fidelity and determine the effect of each component and the interactions between each component and the corresponding outcome. METHODS: A prospective, assessor-blinded, randomised clinical trial with fractional factorial design using the MOST principle. Two hundred fifty family dementia caregivers will be randomised to one of 16 experimental conditions in a fractional factorial design involving six intervention components: (1) dementia and caregiving education; (2) self-care skills; (3) behavioural symptom management; (4) behavioural activation; (5) modified mindfulness-based cognitive therapy; and (6) support group. The first one is the core component, and the five remaining will be examined. Physical health, caregiver burden, stress, psychological well-being, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and social support will be assessed over the 12-month study period. Following the intention-to-treat principle, linear mixed models and regression analyses will be used to examine the specific effect of the five components and their two-way interactions to propose the most effective combination. DISCUSSION: This is the first study adopting the multiphase optimisation strategy to identify the most active and engaging components of a psychological intervention for caregivers of patients with dementia. In view that dementia caregiver interventions are increasingly diversified and complex, such knowledge is important to maximise the intervention efficacy and allow the intervention to be implemented within an efficient timeframe and dosage. The optimisation of caregiver support interventions is critical to enhance the health outcomes of caregivers and care recipients, thereby, delaying possible institutionalisation and reducing the costs of long-term dementia care.

        "title": "The MEDITAGING study: protocol of a two-armed randomized controlled study to compare the effects of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program against a health promotion program in older migrants in Luxembourg.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migration is a phenomenon worldwide, with older migrants, particularly those with fewer socioeconomic resources, having an increased risk of developing adverse cognitive and health outcomes and social isolation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to validate interventions that promote healthy aging in this population. Previous studies have shown a positive impact of mindfulness based-stress reduction (MBSR) on outcomes such as cognition and sleep. However, only a few studies verified its potential in older adults, especially with vulnerable populations such as migrants. This article presents the protocol of the MEDITAGING study, which is the first to investigate the MBSR effects in migrants aged \u226555 in comparison to a health promotion program. METHODS: MEDITAGING is a two-arm randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, which will include older Portuguese-speaking migrants (n = 90). Participants are randomized to the MBSR or a health promotion program. Both interventions are conducted in groups over a total of 8 weeks, incorporating weekly meetings, an additional 4-hour class, and extra at-home tasks. The health promotion program has the same structure as the MBSR but comprises different activities related to dementia prevention, healthy habits, cognitive stimulation, sleeping, nutrition, watercolor painting, and physical activity. The assessment of executive functioning, physiological stress measures, self-reported questionnaires, and qualitative interviews are conducted at baseline, after 8 weeks (post-intervention), and at a follow-up session (from one to 3 months thereafter). Analyzes will be conducted using a modified intention-to-treat approach (all participants with at least 3 days of participation in the group-sessions and one post-intervention observation). DISCUSSION: This study will test effects of a mindfulness-based intervention against an active control condition in older adult migrants, which few studies have addressed.

        "title": "Brief breath awareness training yields poorer working memory performance in the context of acute stress.",
        "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions that span multiple sessions over time appear to confer psychological benefits. However, the effects of brief periods of mindfulness meditation training are less clear, particularly on measures of cognitive functioning. This study assessed whether brief mindfulness practice (breath awareness) or training in two other contemplative practices - loving-kindness and gratitude - differentially impact working memory performance following acute physiological stress relative to an attentional control. Participants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to one of four training groups and completed the automated Operation Span (OSPAN) task pre-training and again after undergoing the cold pressor task. Three of the four groups improved in OSPAN performance, with loving-kindness, gratitude, and attentional control conditions showing increases in OSPAN relative to breath awareness. Changes in OSPAN were not correlated with changes in positive or negative affect. It appears that brief breath awareness training may not effectively buffer against acute stress in this predominantly meditation naive sample and may in fact impair subsequent cognitive performance relative to a control or other contemplative practices. A granular approach is warranted to understand potentially distinct and contextually variable effects of different contemplative practices. Implications are discussed in light of the stress buffering hypothesis and Monitor and Acceptance Theory.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02214264.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of a daily mindfulness practice and 2 types of journaling on participants' development of self-compassion. METHOD: This was a between-groups design. All participants in a graduate counseling course engaged in a short daily mindfulness practice at the beginning of every class. Participants were randomly assigned to a counseling journal or a gratitude journal group. Participants were to write in their journals 2 to 5 times a week for the duration of the class. Participants completed the Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) and a questionnaire created by the 1st author before any mindfulness sessions were held and again at the completion of the course. RESULTS: Participants' level of self-compassion increased from pretest to posttest. The self-compassion scores of participants who kept counseling journals increased more than did those of participants who kept gratitude journals. Qualitative data indicated that participants believed that mindfulness was an important quality for clinicians to possess and that they were accepting of the daily mindfulness practice. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in a 12-min daily mindfulness practice utilizing simple yoga postures, breath work, reflective writing, and journaling done at a separate time appears to be an effective technique for increasing students' levels of self-compassion. Maintaining a counseling journal as opposed to a gratitude journal appears to enhance the effect of the daily mindfulness practice on self-compassion.",

        "abstract": "Mind-body interventions such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) may improve well-being by increasing awareness and regulation of physiological and cognitive states. However, it is unclear how practice may alter long-term, baseline physiological processes, and whether these changes reflect improved well-being. Using respiration rate (RR), which can be sensitive to effects of meditation, and 3 aspects of self-reported well-being (psychological well-being [PWB], distress, and medical symptoms), we tested pre-registered hypotheses that: (1) Lower baseline RR (in a resting, non-meditative state) would be a physiological marker associated with well-being, (2) MBSR would decrease RR, and (3) Training-related decreases in RR would be associated with improved well-being. We recruited 245 adults (age range = 18-65, M = 42.4): experienced meditators (n = 42), and meditation-naive participants randomized to MBSR (n = 72), active control (n = 41), or waitlist control (n = 66). Data were collected at pre-randomization, post-intervention (or waiting), and long-term follow-up. Lower baseline RR was associated with lower psychological distress among long-term meditators (p* = 0.03, b = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.03]), though not in non-meditators prior to training. MBSR decreased RR compared to waitlist (p = 0.02, Cohen's d = - 0.41, 95% CI [- 0.78, - 0.06]), but not the active control. Decreased RR related to decreased medical symptoms, across all participants (p* = 0.02, b = 0.57, 95% CI [0.15, 0.98]). Post-training, lower RR was associated with higher PWB across training groups compared to waitlist (p* = 0.01, b = 0.06, 95% CI [0.02, 0.10]), though there were no significant differences in change in PWB between groups. This physiological marker may indicate higher physical and/or psychological well-being in those who engage in wellness practices.",

The online mode of teaching during and post-pandemic era has increased students' daily screen time. As they spend more time indoors, they tend to disconnect from nature even more, adversely impacting their well-being. This study aimed to design and execute two well-being interventions-a positive psychology intervention (PPI) and a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in natural settings for urban school students in India. METHODS: One hundred eighty participants (aged 17-20) from a senior secondary school were randomly assigned to three groups: PPI, MBI, and a control group (CTR). Participants self-reported their levels of well-being, gratitude, inclusion of nature in self, sense of connectedness, resilience, awareness, perceived stress, and positive and negative emotions using a survey questionnaire at two times-pre- and post-interventions. Repeated-measures ANOVA was employed across time and groups, and post hoc analyses for group differences were carried out through the Bonferroni test. RESULTS: Results indicate that both PPI and MBI interventions, when executed in natural settings, enhance student well-being, gratitude, inclusion of nature in self, sense of connectedness, resilience, awareness, positive emotions and decreased levels of perceived stress, and negative emotions. DISCUSSION: The study provides valuable insights for school authorities, policymakers, and urban planners to include natural settings in school premises and offer well-being interventions for students to connect with nature consciously.",

        "title": "MITIG.RA: study protocol of a tailored psychological intervention for managing fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite remarkable medical advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a subset of patients fails to achieve complete clinical remission, as the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity remains above 1, even after the inflammatory process is brought under control. This so-called state of 'PGA-near-remission' negatively impacts individuals' functioning and potentiates inadequate care. Fatigue is a distressing and disabling symptom frequently reported by patients in PGA-near-remission, and its management remains challenging. While classic cognitive-behavioural interventions show some benefits in managing fatigue, there is potential for improvement. Recently, contextual-cognitive behavioural therapies (CCBT), like mindfulness, acceptance, and compassion-based interventions, have shown promising results in fatigue-associated disorders and their determinants. This study primarily aims to examine the efficacy of the Compassion and Mindfulness Intervention for RA (MITIG.RA), a novel intervention combining different components of CCBT, compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in the management of RA-associated fatigue. Secondary aims involve exploring whether MITIG.RA produces changes in the perceived impact of disease, satisfaction with disease status, levels of depression, and emotion-regulation skills. METHODS: This is a single center, two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial. Patients will be screened for eligibility and willingness to participate and will be assessed and randomized to the experimental (MITIG.RA + TAU) or control condition (TAU) using computer randomization. MITIG.RA will be delivered by a certified psychologist and comprises eight sessions of 2 h, followed by two booster sessions. Outcomes will be assessed through validated self-report measures, including fatigue (primary outcome), perceived impact of disease, depressive symptoms, mindfulness, self-compassion, safety, and satisfaction (secondary outcomes). Assessment will take place at baseline, post-intervention, before the first and second booster sessions (weeks 12 and 20, respectively), and at 32 and 44 weeks after the interventions' beginning. DISCUSSION: We expect MITIG.RA to be effective in reducing levels of RA-associated fatigue. Secondarily, we hypothesize that the experimental group will show improvements in the overall perceived impact of disease, emotional distress, and emotion regulation skills. Our findings will contribute to determine the benefits of combining CCBT approaches for managing fatigue and associated distress in RA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05389189.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of interventions based on mindfulness and compassion has been demonstrated in both clinical and general population, and in different social contexts. These interventions include so-called attentional and constructive meditation practices, respectively. However, there is a third group, known as deconstructive meditation practices, which has not been scientifically studied. Deconstructive practices aim to undo maladaptive cognitive patterns and generate knowledge about internal models of oneself, others and the world. Although there are theoretical and philosophical studies on the origin of addiction to the self or on the mechanisms of action associated with the deconstruction of the self, there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating these techniques in either a healthy population or clinical samples. This study aims to evaluate the effect of three deconstructive techniques by comparing them to mindfulness in the general population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted with about 240 participants allocated to four groups: (a) mindful breathing, (b) prostrations, according to Tibetan Buddhist tradition; (c) the Koan Mu, according to Zen Buddhist tradition; and (d) the mirror exercise, according to Toltec tradition. The primary outcome will be the qualities of the non-dual experience and spiritual awakening, measured by the Nondual Embodiment Thematic Inventory, assessed at pre- and post-treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Other outcomes will be mindfulness, happiness, compassion, affectivity and altered state of consciousness. Quantitative data will be compared using mixed-effects linear regression models, and qualitative data will be analysed through thematic analysis and using the constant comparative method from grounded theory.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with the lowest treatment response rate among all anxiety disorders. Understanding mechanisms of improvement may help to develop more effective and personalized treatments. AIM: The objective of the study was to investigate different improvement mechanisms in the treatment of individuals diagnosed with GAD. DESIGN: We reported data from a randomized controlled trial that evaluated three different GAD treatments (mindfulness-based intervention, BMT; fluoxetine, FLX; and an active comparison group, QoL) for 8 weeks. METHOD: Mediation analyses were performed evaluating the association between worry symptoms at baseline and anxiety scoring at the endpoint, considering self-compassion or mindfulness or its dimensions at mid-treatment as mediators for the whole sample (assessing GAD improvement mechanism) and the different interventions as moderators. RESULTS: Contrary to mindfulness state scoring (C = .06; 95% CI = -.05 to .20), self-compassion (C = .11; 95% CI = .01 to .28) and non-judgement of inner experience (C = .10; 95% CI = .004 to .21) mediated the association between worry symptoms at baseline and anxiety at the endpoint. When comparing BMT to FLX, the intervention modality did not moderate these associations. CONCLUSION: Self-compassion and non-judgement of inner experience seem to be essential targets in GAD treatment, contrary to the mindfulness state itself. Although no difference was found considering the intervention modality, future research may assess how to boost these dimensions in specific treatments for GAD.",

        "abstract": "The current study evaluated the efficacy of a three-week self-compassion (SC) meditation intervention in improving body image and SC during pregnancy and postpartum. Participants (n = 71; age = 31.92 \u00b1 3.98 years; white = 61, 85.9%; intervention = 35, 49.3%; pregnant = 33, 46.5%; postpartum = 38, 53.5%) were recruited from a health coaching program and 35 were randomly assigned into a three-week SC meditation intervention while 36 were randomly assigned to a waitlist control condition. Linear regressions using full-information maximum likelihood estimation examined the effect of intervention group on body image and SC outcomes controlling for baseline level of outcome, pregnancy or postpartum status, previous meditation experience, and physical activity. Results indicated women in the intervention group reported significantly reduced body shame and body dissatisfaction and improved body appreciation and self-compassion compared to women in the control group. Implementation of a brief SC meditation intervention during pregnancy and postpartum has potential to improve mental health outcomes related to body image. Future work should replicate this study with a larger, more diverse sample of women.",

        "title": "Group mindful self-compassion training to improve mental health outcomes for LGBTQIA+ young adults: Rationale and protocol for a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Young adults who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual and other diverse genders and sexualities (LGBTQIA+) are more likely to experience mental health difficulties and are at significantly elevated risk of substance abuse, self-harm and suicide, relative to their heterosexual, endosex and cisgender peers. There is a need for effective mental health interventions for LGBTQIA+ young adults. Mindful Self-Compassion training is a promising approach; among LGBTQIA+ individuals, self-compassion accounts for more variation in mental health outcomes than bullying, victimization, and adverse childhood experiences combined. Furthermore, LGBTQIA+ individuals with high self-compassion report more positive identity and happiness, less self-stigma, and lower suicidality than those with low self-compassion. METHOD: This paper outlines the rationale and protocol for a single-blind CONSORT-compliant randomised controlled trial, comparing group Mindful Self-Compassion to a delayed-treatment waitlist control group, for improving mental health, decreasing self-criticism and increasing self-compassion in LGBTQIA+ young adults (age 18-25 years). Mindful Self-Compassion training is an 8-week group program that focuses on cultivating self-compassion and mindfulness. While typically delivered as a face-to-face program, the proposed trial will investigate efficacy of the program when provided via videoconferencing. DISCUSSION: Videoconference Mindful Self-Compassion training has the potential to improve the mental health of Australian LGBTQIA+ young adults and provide a possible cost-effective, scalable intervention for this population. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for LGBTQIA+ young adults and will provide the first data on the delivery of the program via videoconferencing.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of the novel intervention mindful hypnotherapy on depression, self-compassion, and psychological inflexibility in females with major depressive disorder was examined in a randomized, clinical trial. Thirty-four participants were randomly allocated into mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups. The intervention group was treated in 8 face-to-face, 60-minute weekly therapy sessions along with mindful hypnosis audio tapes to be used daily. The results of analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences between the mindful hypnotherapy and waitlist control groups after intervention and at 2-month follow-up (p < .001). The between-subject test of repeated measures ANOVAs also indicated a clinically significant difference between groups across time (baseline, postintervention, and 2-month follow-up) in depression, F = 53.86, p < .001, effect size = .65, and in self-compassion, F = 33.18, p < .001, effect size = .53, as well as psychological inflexibility, F = 26.84, p < .001, effect size = .48. In conclusion, this study indicates that mindful hypnotherapy is an effective intervention for treating depression as well as reducing psychological inflexibility and improving self-compassion for patients with major depressive disorder.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Infertility and its treatment bring a considerable emotional burden. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of smartphone-delivered mindfulness apps for reducing symptoms of emotional distress in both clinical and non-clinical populations. Evidence on this topic in women, men and couples experiencing infertility is currently under-represented. The aim of the MoMiFer study is, therefore, to investigate the efficacy of a stand-alone mobile mindfulness app on symptoms of emotional distress and fertility-related quality of life in people experiencing infertility. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is an exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with open enrollment. The primary outcomes are symptoms of emotional distress and fertility-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes are mindfulness skills, repetitive negative thinking, self-compassion, user-rated quality of the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app and use of the app. Experience sampling method and standardised self-report questionnaires are combined within a repeated measures design to measure the effects of the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app on the primary and secondary outcomes, apart from the use of the app. The latter will be evaluated through app tracking. People, including women, men and couples, experiencing infertility (n=60) will be randomised to an intervention group receiving the stand-alone mobile mindfulness app for 3 months or a wait-list control group. The app follows the format and content of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Data will be collected at baseline, at 1.5 months and 3 months after randomisation. Analysis will be according to intention to treat and based on general linear modelling and multilevel mixed-effects modelling. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received approval from the Medical Ethical Committee of the Leuven University Hospital (Belgium). The findings of this exploratory RCT will be disseminated through presentations at public lectures, scientific institutions and meetings, and through peer-reviewed scientific articles.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: One in five mothers will experience perinatal depression (PND) during pregnancy and within their first year following childbirth. Current evidence suggests the short-term efficacy of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for perinatal women, but the extent to which this positive impact remains the early postpartum period is unclear. This study investigated the short- and maintenance efficacy of a mobile-delivered four-immeasurable MBI on PND, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-five adult pregnant women suffering from heightened distress were randomized to receive a mobile-delivered four-immeasurable MBI (n = 38) or a web-based perinatal education program (n = 37). PND was measured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at baseline, post-intervention, 37th-week gestation, and 4-6 weeks postpartum. Outcomes also included obstetric and neonatal outcomes, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and positive affect. RESULTS: Participants reported an average age of 30.6 (SD = 3.1) years with a mean gestational age of 18.8 (SD = 4.6) weeks. In intention-to-treat analyses, women in the mindfulness group showed a significantly greater reduction in depression from baseline to post-intervention (adjusted mean change difference [beta] = -3.9; 95%CI = [-6.05, -1.81]; d = -0.6), and the reduction sustained until 4-6 weeks postpartum (beta = -6.3; 95%CI = [-8.43, -4.12]; d = -1.0), compared with control. They had a significantly reduced risk of emergent cesarean section (relative risk = 0.5) and gave birth to infants with higher Apgar scores (beta = 0.6;p = .03; d = 0.7). Depression reduction before giving birth significantly mediated the intervention effect on lowering the emergency cesarean risk. CONCLUSIONS: With a reasonably low dropout rate (13.2 %), the mobile-delivered MBI can be an acceptable and effective intervention for reducing depression throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Our study also suggests the potential benefits of early prevention for mitigating emergent cesarean section risk and enhancing neonatal health.",

        "title": "Investigating differential effects of socio-emotional and mindfulness-based online interventions on mental health, resilience and social capacities during the COVID-19 pandemic: The study protocol.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a mental health crisis on a global scale. Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21. METHODS: We will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including 'Affect Dyad') and a mindfulness-based (including 'Breathing Meditation') intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample (N = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva. DISCUSSION: Results will reveal the differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of global stressors.

        "abstract": "Chinese immigrant survivors of men's violence experience both significant mental health impacts from abuse and barriers to formal services. Therefore, we examined the preliminary efficacy of an innovative mobile-based empowerment-based intervention (self-compassion, health, and empowerment; SHE) that specifically focuses on abused Chinese immigrant women in the US. This pilot study used a two-arm randomized controlled design with repeated measures. A convenience sample (N = 50) of Chinese immigrant women who experienced past year intimate partner violence (IPV) were recruited online and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group (25 per group). We assessed IPV exposure, safety behaviors, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and self-compassion at baseline, post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up. Of 95 eligible participants, 50 (52.6%) agreed to participate and completed baseline data collection; intervention completion rate was 64%. We found a significant group and time interaction for self-judgment (a self-compassion component), with a significant reduction seen in the intervention group compared to the control group. Despite no other significant group differences observed over time, the intervention group showed consistent trends toward improvements in most outcome measures, including specific types of IPV (i.e., negotiation, psychological aggression, and sexual coercion), depressive and PTSD symptoms, self-compassion, and certain components of self-compassion (i.e., isolation and over-identification) when compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the SHE intervention shows promise in improving the mental health well-being of Chinese immigrant survivors. However, a fully powered randomized controlled trial is warranted to determine its efficacy. Our intervention has the potential to be translated in the Chinese immigrant populations with the necessary organizational support.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) and supportive expressive group therapy (SET) are two well-validated psychosocial interventions, but they have not been directly compared, and little is known about long-term outcomes. This comparative effectiveness study measured the effects of these two interventions immediately following the groups and for 1 year thereafter in distressed breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-two distressed Stage I-III breast cancer survivors were randomized into either MBCR or SET. Women completed questionnaires addressing mood, stress symptoms, quality of life, social support, spirituality and post-traumatic growth before and after the interventions, and 6 and 12 months later. RESULTS: Immediately following the intervention, women in MBCR reported greater reduction in mood disturbance (primarily fatigue, anxiety and confusion) and stress symptoms including tension, sympathetic arousal and cognitive symptoms than those in SET. They also reported increased emotional and functional quality of life, emotional, affective and positive social support, spirituality (feelings of peace and meaning in life) and post-traumatic growth (appreciation for life and ability to see new possibilities) relative to those in SET, who also improved to a lesser degree on many outcomes. Effect sizes of the time * group interactions were small to medium, and most benefits were maintained over 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first and largest to demonstrate sustained benefits of MBCR in distressed breast cancer survivors relative to an active control. MBCR was superior to SET for improving psychological well-being with lasting benefits over 1 year, suggesting these women gained long-lasting and efficacious tools to cope with cancer.

        "title": "Efficacy of the Mental Health App \"Intellect\" to Improve Body Image and Self-compassion in Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial With a 4-Week Follow-up.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Body image concerns are prevalent among young adults, who may be vulnerable to developing body image concerns because of particular risk factors associated with this life period. With technological advancements, digital mobile health (mHealth) apps are cost-effective and scalable interventions. Thus, mHealth apps can be explored as a form of prevention effort to alleviate body image concerns in young adults. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we examined the effectiveness of a self-guided mHealth app in improving body image and self-compassion in a sample of university students. METHODS: Participants (N=310) were randomized to a 9-day self-guided body image and self-compassion mHealth app (n=149) and to an active waitlist control group (n=161), where they completed a similarly structured 9-day program on cooperation. Both programs consisted of content learning and activities such as quizzes, with the number and length of activities matched for both programs. Measures were obtained at baseline, upon completion of the programs (after the intervention), and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention group for female participants reported significant reduction in body dissatisfaction (P<.001) and improvements in body appreciation (P<.001) and self-compassion (P=.001) compared with the active waitlist control group after the intervention. Similarly, for male participants after the intervention, a significant reduction was found in the intervention group in body dissatisfaction (P<.001) after the intervention as well as improvements in body appreciation (P=.02) and self-compassion (P=.047). The effects were maintained at 4-week follow-up for female participants on body dissatisfaction (P<.001), body appreciation (P<.001), and self-compassion (P=.02) but not for male participants. On body image risk factors, significant reductions were found for female participants after the intervention for thin-ideal internalization (P<.001), peer pressure (P=.002), and media pressure (P<.001) after the intervention, while the effects were only maintained for thin-ideal internalization (P=.008) and media pressure (P=.01) at 4-week follow-up, compared with the active waitlist control group. As for male participants, no intervention effects were found both after the intervention and at follow-up for all body image risk factors of muscularity internalization, peer pressure, and media pressure. Both apps were acceptable and participants engaged equally across the intervention and active waitlist control groups, as indicated on a measure of app engagement (P=.76). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for a self-guided mHealth app in improving body image concerns and self-compassion in young adult university students. Future studies should include longer follow-ups, and examine its effects with the wider populations of young adults.

        "title": "Towards a mechanistic understanding of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) using an RCT neuroimaging approach: Effects on regulating own stress in social and non-social situations.",
        "abstract": "Although much research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can reduce psychological stress, it is less clear if effects generalize to everyday social situations, which range among the largest stress triggers. Furthermore, mechanisms of MBIs have not been fully established. Emotion regulation (ER) has been suggested as one key mechanism, yet the role of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance strategies is still under debate. To address these questions, a neuroimaging-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed (n=68), comparing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with a reading/listening intervention (READ), using a novel dyadic paradigm for self and other emotion regulation under stress as primary outcome on behavior and brain levels and established empathy measures (clinicatrials.gov NCT03035669). Compared to READ, MBSR led to self-reported stress reduction through both cognitive reappraisal and acceptance only when regulating self and not when regulating others' distress. In addition, MBSR led to increased brain activation over time for regulating own (parietal cortex) and others' (precuneus, TPJ) emotions through cognitive reappraisal and acceptance, albeit this effect was also seen for the reading intervention for regulating own stress via reappraisal. Brain changes did not scale with subjective stress reduction and amount of meditation practice. More distant generalization effects of MBSR on socio-emotional functioning (cognitive empathy and compassion) could also not be shown. This study identified both cognitive reappraisal and acceptance as two ER mechanisms of MBSR, but indicates that effects do not extend to social settings.",

Standardized measures assessed patients' pain, anger, and psychological distress. FINDINGS: Post and follow-up analyses showed significant improvements in pain and psychological distress in the loving-kindness group, but no changes in the usual care group. Multilevel analyses of daily data showed that more loving-kindness practice on a given day was related to lower pain that day and lower anger the next day.

This study is the first to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of yoga within a weight management program following WL treatment. METHODS: 60 women with overweight or obesity (34.3\u00b13.9 kg/m2, 48.1\u00b110.1 years) were randomized to receive a 12-week yoga intervention (2x/week; YOGA) or a structurally equivalent control (cooking/nutrition classes; CON), following a 3-month behavioral WL program. Feasibility (attendance, adherence, retention) and acceptability (program satisfaction ratings) were assessed. Treatment groups were compared on weight change, mindfulness, distress tolerance, stress, affect, and self-compassion at 6 months. Initial WL (3-mo WL) was evaluated as a potential moderator. RESULTS: Attendance, retention, and program satisfaction ratings of yoga were high. Treatment groups did not differ on WL or psychological constructs (with exception of one mindfulness subscale) at 6 months. However, among those with high initial WL (\u22655%), YOGA lost significantly more weight (-9.0kg vs. -6.7kg) at 6 months and resulted in greater distress tolerance, mindfulness, and self-compassion and lower negative affect, compared to CON.

Outcome measures included: joint position sense (JPS(45)\u00b0, JPS(55)\u00b0, JPS(65)\u00b0) and joint kinesthesia (JK(Flex) and JK(Ext)), the Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool (TIN), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), dynamic posturography (DMA and TIME) and the Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG). Test administrators were blinded to group affiliation. Significant between-group differences favoring the YoMed group were observed for TIN (p = 0.01, d = 0.77) and JK(Flex) (p = 0.05, d = -0.72). DMA and TIME scores significantly improved for both groups, and no adverse events were reported. These findings indicate that the YoMed program is safe and effective for patients with PD.

        "title": "Online self-compassion training to improve the wellbeing of youth with chronic medical conditions: protocol for a randomised control trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic medical conditions (CMCs) affect up to 35% of children and adolescents. Youth with chronic medical conditions are at an increased risk of psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life, and report rates of mental illness up to double that of their physically healthy peers. Accessible, evidence-based interventions for young people with chronic illness are urgently required to improve their mental health and daily functioning. Self-compassion involves taking a mindful, accepting approach to difficult experiences, being aware that one is not alone in one's suffering, and being kind and understanding with oneself during challenging times. Self-compassion shares strong associations with mental health outcomes among young people and preliminary work indicates that interventions that build self-compassion have the potential to substantially improve youth mental health. Self-compassion is also associated with better physical and mental health outcomes among individuals living with CMCs. While face-to-face self-compassion training is available, there are several barriers to access for youth with CMCs. Online self-compassion training potentially offers an accessible alternative for this high-risk group. METHODS: Self-Compassion Online (SCO) is a self-compassion program that has been tested with a non-clinical adult group. For the proposed trial, a reference group of youth (16-25 years) with chronic illness reviewed the program and proposed adaptations to improve its suitability for youth with chronic illness. In alignment with the SPIRIT Checklist, this paper outlines the protocol for a CONSORT-compliant, single-blind randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of the adapted program, relative to a waitlist control, for improving self-compassion, wellbeing, distress, emotion regulation, coping and quality of life among young Australians with CMCs. Mechanisms of action and feasibility of SCO will be analysed using quantitative data and participant interviews, respectively. Finally, cost-utility will be analysed using health-related quality of life data. DISCUSSION: The SCO program could provide a scalable solution for improving psychological outcomes and quality of life among youth with chronic illness. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for improving these outcomes, relative to waitlist control.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Junior doctors are frequently exposed to occupational and traumatic stress, sometimes with tragic consequences. Mindfulness-based and fitness interventions are increasingly used to mitigate this, but have not been compared.We conducted a randomised, controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of these interventions in junior doctors. METHODS: We randomised participants (n=21) to weekly 1-hour sessions of personalised, trauma-informed yoga (n=10), with a 4-hour workshop, and eHealth homework; or group-format fitness (n=8) in an existing wellness programme, MDOK. Burnout, traumatic stress and suicidality were measured at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Both interventions reduced burnout, and yoga increased compassion satisfaction within group on the Professional Quality of Life scale, without difference between groups on this measure.Personalised yoga significantly reduced depersonalisation (z=-1.99, p=0.05) compared with group fitness on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS (MP)) and showed greater flexibility changes. Both interventions increased MBI Personal Accomplishment, with no changes in other self-report psychological or physiological metrics, including breath-counting.Participants doing one-to-one yoga rated it more highly overall (p=0.02) than group fitness, and reported it comparatively more beneficial for mental (p=0.01) and physical health (p=0.05). Face-to-face weekly sessions were 100% attended in yoga, but only 45% in fitness. CONCLUSION: In this pilot trial, both yoga and fitness improved burnout, but trauma-informed yoga reduced depersonalisation in junior doctors more than group-format fitness. One-to-one yoga was better adhered than fitness, but was more resource intensive. Junior doctors need larger-scale comparative research of the effectiveness and implementation of individual, organisational and systemic mental health interventions.

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated anxiety and related symptoms among the general population. In order to cope with the mental health burden, we developed an online brief modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (mMBSR) therapy. We performed a parallel-group randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the mMBSR for adult anxiety with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as an active control. Participants were randomized to mMBSR, CBT or waitlist group. Those in the intervention arms performed each therapy for 6 sections in 3 weeks. Measurements were conducted at baseline, post-treatment and 6 months post-treatment by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, reverse scored Cohen Perceived Stress scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. 150 participants with anxiety symptoms were randomized to mMBSR, CBT or waitlist group. Post intervention assessments showed that mMBSR improved the scores of all the six mental problem dimensions (anxiety, depression, somatization, stress, insomnia, and the experience of pleasure) significantly compared to the waitlist group. During 6-month post treatment assessment, the scores of all six mental problem dimensions in the mMBSR group still showed improvement compared to baseline and showed no significant difference with the CBT group. Our results provide positive evidence for the efficacy and feasibility of an online brief modified MBSR program to alleviate anxiety and related symptoms of individuals from the general population, and the therapeutic benefits of mMBSR persisted for up to six months. This low resource-consuming intervention could facilitate the challenges of supplying psychological health therapy to large scale of population.",

        "title": "Engaging Patients in Research That Involves Meditation: Religious Concerns and Nursing Implications.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the use of meditative practices for supporting symptom management among patients undergoing cancer treatment have increased substantially in recent years. Although meditative practices as adjuncts to promoting health have become mainstream, concerns that such strategies conflict with traditional religious tenets have co-occurred. In the context of a 12-week sequential multiple assignment randomized trial of home-based meditative practices and reflexology delivered to patients with cancer by or with family caregivers to manage symptoms, early attrition was identified in the meditative practices arm. OBJECTIVE: Finding religious concerns were factors contributing to attrition; the purpose is to describe adjustments to the training protocol for study recruiters and interveners when enrolling participants and teaching patient-caregiver dyads meditative practices. METHODS: The training protocol for recruiters and interveners was adapted to address religious concerns related to meditative practices. RESULTS: Since initiation, recruiters and interveners have appreciated the adapted protocol, which has improved their capacity to respond to religious concerns. Participants have responded well to consideration of the practices as mindful movements coordinated with breath. CONCLUSIONS: Given broader application of meditation in symptom management studies, researchers will need to be ready to address religious concerns. It is essential that protocols for introducing meditation are broadly presented to respond to concerns of patients and cancer caregivers regarding perceived conflicts with their specific religious beliefs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As the provision of integrative care options that include meditation training for patients grows, nurses require awareness of potential barriers and strategies to ameliorate religious concerns.",

        "abstract": "When evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on the stress response, several aspects should be considered, such as (1) effects on various response systems, (2) temporal dynamics of the stress response, and (3) differences between programs. This study assesses the stress-attenuating effects of a standard mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and a second-generation MBI: MBSR with elements of other Buddhist practices (MBSR-B). Ninety-nine healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the MBSR, MBSR-B, or waitlist control groups and their stress response was evaluated with the Trier Social Stress Test. Changes in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathoadrenomedullary system, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and affect were measured during distinct phases of the task. Compared to waitlist control, the stress-attenuated effects of MBIs were detected across almost all systems and both negative and positive affect. In the parasympathetic branch of the ANS, the effect of MBIs was present in all stress phases (however, in the recovery phase, only MBSR-B has shown a statistically significant effect in comparison with the waitlist control). The stress-attenuating effects of MBIs were observed already in the anticipatory phase for cortisol, ANS, and negative affect (for negative affect, only the modified MBSR-B program has shown statistically significant effect in comparison with the waitlist control).",

However, workers have been considered to have limited access to psychological support because of time constraints, which makes it difficult for them to engage in face-to-face psychological support interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present an intervention protocol that describes a randomized controlled trial to examine whether brief guided mindfulness meditation (MM) or self-compassion meditation (SCM) provided by a smartphone app is effective for mental health and work-related outcomes among workers. METHODS: This is an open-label, 3-arm randomized controlled trial. The participants will be recruited through an open call on relevant websites with the following inclusion criteria: (1) employees who are working more than 20 hours per week, (2) between the ages of 18 and 54 years, (3) not on a leave of absence, (4) not business owners or students, and (5) not currently diagnosed with a mental disorder and have a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6 score below 13 points. We will include 200 participants and randomly assign them to an SCM course (n=67), an MM course (n=67), and a waitlist group (n=66). The intervention groups (SCM and MM) will be instructed to engage in daily guided self-help, self-compassion, and MMs lasting 6-12 minutes per day over 4 weeks. Primary outcomes will include psychological distress and job performance, and secondary outcomes will include somatic symptoms, cognitive flexibility, self-esteem, self-compassion, perceived stress, well-being, emotion regulation, work engagement, anger, psychological safety, and creativity. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Tokyo (22-326). All participants will be informed of the study via the websites, and written informed consent will be collected via web-based forms. RESULTS: The recruitment of participants began in December 2022, and the intervention began in January 2023. As of September 2023, a total of 375 participants have been enrolled. The intervention and data collection were completed in late October 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the development of effective self-care intervention content that will improve mental health, work performance, and related outcomes and promote mindful and self-compassionate attitudes when faced with distress.

        "title": "Participant experiences of change in mindfulness-based stress reduction for anxiety disorders.",
        "abstract": "AIM: To explore experiences of change among participants in a randomized clinical trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for anxiety disorders. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the subjective experiences of change for individuals with anxiety disorders after a course in MBSR. Interviews were analysed employing hermeneutic-phenomenological thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five main themes were identified: 1) Something useful to do when anxiety appears, 2) Feeling more at ease, 3) Doing things my anxiety wouldn't let me, 4) Meeting what is there, and 5) Better-but not there yet. Most participants used what they had learned for instrumental purposes, and described relief from anxiety and an increased sense of personal agency. A few reported more radical acceptance of anxiety, as well as increased self-compassion. CONCLUSION: Participants of MBSR both describe mindfulness as a tool to \"fix\" anxiety and as bringing about more fundamental change towards acceptance of their anxiety. The complexity of reported change corresponds with better handling of areas representing known transdiagnostic features of anxiety disorder, such as dysfunctional cognitive processes (including attentional biases), emotional dysregulation, avoidance behaviours, and maladaptive self-relatedness. This supports MBSR as a transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

        "abstract": "Intervention programs based on self-compassion have demonstrated their efficacy both in reducing psychological distress and increasing well-being. The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of an online intervention to increase mindfulness and self-compassion levels in a non-clinical sample in a highly stressful context: the ten weeks of lockdown imposed in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention sessions consisted of thirty-minute guided meditations followed by thirty minutes of inquiry. Sixty-one participants completed two thirds of the sessions or more, and 65 individuals participated in a waiting-list (WL) control group. Self-compassion, anxiety, depression and stress levels were assessed. The analysis of pre-post results suggests that the interventions increased self-compassion levels and decreased anxiety, depression and stress levels, whereas the WL group did not show any significant changes. The emotional changes in the intervention group were associated with the increase in self-compassion. However, at follow-up, the scores of emotional distress variables returned to the initial pre-intervention scores. These data can be interpreted in line with previous results that have shown the efficacy of self-compassion-based intervention programs. Given that this efficacy was not maintained at follow-up, data are discussed according to the pervasive role of a highly stressful context and-as described in other studies-the need for regular practice to maintain the benefits obtained.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that nurses have been more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than any other group of hospital workers in terms of anxiety, depression, and burnout. Several clinical studies had previously demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness and compassion interventions in reducing burnout and emotional distress amongst healthcare professionals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a mindfulness and compassion-focused programme on frontline nurses who had been working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-two participants will be recruited from Verona University Hospital Trust (Veneto Region, north-east Italy) and will be divided equally into an intervention group and a control group. Primary outcome will be assessed using the Emotional Exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS). Secondary outcomes will be measured by the Cynicism and Professional Efficacy subscales of the MBI-GS, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Impact of Stressful Events (IES-R), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Forms of Self-Criticising/attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale (FSCRS).

The program was developed around the themes of resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment to fight burnout and enhance purposeful adaptive coping to reduce distress and improve mental wellbeing. The sample included 77 unit-based nurse leaders. Outcomes included post-traumatic growth, resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, perceived stress, burnout, and job satisfaction. Paired samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA tests were conducted to compare outcomes at baseline to the follow-up timepoints of endpoint, one-month follow-up, three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up. The intervention group participants showed significant improvement in post-traumatic growth between baseline and all follow-up timepoints compared to the waitlist control group. Among intervention group participants, there were also significant improvements in self-reflection and insight, self-compassion, psychological empowerment, and compassion satisfaction, as well as significant reductions in perceived stress, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. This study extends existing evidence that this psychoeducational group program can be an effective intervention for improving and protecting mental wellbeing. Among nurse leaders, it can reduce stress and burnout and improve post-traumatic growth, self-reflection and insight, self-compassion, psychological empowerment, and compassion satisfaction.",

The primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment, measure completion rates, retention rates and internet connection failure rates. The secondary pilot outcomes were change on clinical measures and state shame ratings during the interventions. Participants were randomized to either online (40-min single session) body exposure or self-compassion interventions. Five validated nomothetic outcome measures (body dissatisfaction, appreciation, eating disorder, external shame and anxiety) were taken at three time points (preintervention, postintervention and 2-week follow-up). Subjective units of body shame (SUBS 0-100 scale) were rated every 5 min during the interventions. The target of recruiting 30 participants in 60 days was successfully achieved. The measure completion rate was high (100%), and retention rates (80% to 100%) showed moderate-to-high acceptability of the interventions. Online delivery was moderately viable with a 12.5% session disconnection rate. The self-compassion intervention significantly reduced SUBS ratings during the course of the intervention, but there was no significant improvement or difference between the interventions on nomothetic outcome measures. Findings suggest that a fully powered trial is viable, and sample size calculation and methodological requirements are provided.",

        "title": "An 18-month meditation training selectively improves psychological well-being in older adults: A secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: As the world population is ageing, it is vital to understand how older adults can maintain and deepen their psychological well-being as they are confronted with the unique challenges of ageing in a complex world. Theoretical work has highlighted the promising role of intentional mental training such as meditation practice for enhancing human flourishing. However, meditation-based randomised controlled trials in older adults are lacking. We aimed to investigate the effects of meditation training on psychological well-being in older adults. METHODS: This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02977819), which randomised 137 healthy older adults (age range: 65 to 84 years) to an 18-month meditation training, an active comparator (English language training), or a passive control. Well-being was measured at baseline, mid-intervention, and 18-month post-randomisation using the Psychological Well-being Scale (PWBS), the World Health Organisation's Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment psychological subscale, and composite scores reflecting the meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, insight, and a global score comprising the average of these meditation-based dimensions. RESULTS: The 18-month meditation training was superior to English training on changes in the global score (0.54 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.82], p = 0.0002) and the subscales of awareness, connection, insight, and superior to no-intervention only on changes in the global score (0.54 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.82], p = 0.0002) and awareness. Between-group differences in psychological QoL in favour of meditation did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. There were no between-group differences in PWBS total score. Within the meditation group, psychological QoL, awareness, insight, and the global score increased significantly from baseline to 18-month post-randomisation. CONCLUSION: The longest randomised meditation training conducted to date enhanced a global composite score reflecting the meditation-based well-being dimensions of awareness, connection, and insight in older adults. Future research is needed to delineate the cognitive, affective, and behavioural factors that predict responsiveness to meditation and thus help refine the development of tailored meditation training.",

        "title": "Investigating efficacy of two brief mind-body intervention programs for managing sleep disturbance in cancer survivors: a pilot randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: After completing treatment, cancer survivors may suffer from a multitude of physical and mental health impairments, resulting in compromised quality of life. This exploratory study investigated whether two mind-body interventions, i.e., Mind-Body Bridging (MBB) and Mindfulness Meditation (MM), could improve posttreatment cancer survivors' self-reported sleep disturbance and comorbid symptoms, as compared to sleep hygiene education (SHE) as an active control. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial examined 57 cancer survivors with clinically significant self-reported sleep disturbance, randomly assigned to receive MBB, MM, or SHE. All interventions were conducted in three sessions, once per week. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed via the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale and other indicators of psychosocial functioning relevant to quality of life, stress, depression, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. RESULTS: Mixed effects model analysis revealed that mean sleep disturbance symptoms in the MBB (p = .0029) and MM (p = .0499) groups were lower than in the SHE group, indicating that both mind-body interventions improved sleep. In addition, compared with the SHE group, the MBB group showed reductions in self-reported depression symptoms (p = .040) and improvements in overall levels of mindfulness (p = .018), self-compassion (p = .028), and well-being (p = .019) at postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that brief sleep-focused MBB and MM are promising interventions for sleep disturbance in cancer survivors. Integrating MBB or MM into posttreatment supportive plans should enhance care of cancer survivors with sleep disturbance. Because MBB produced additional secondary benefits, MBB may serve as a promising multipurpose intervention for posttreatment cancer survivors suffering from sleep disturbance and other comorbid symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Two brief sleep-focused mind-body interventions investigated in the study were effective in reducing sleep disturbance and one of them further improved other psychosocial aspects of the cancer survivors' life. Management of sleep problems in survivors is a high priority issue that demands more attention in cancer survivorship.",

However, limited data are available on feasibility and acceptability of group-based mindfulness interventions in urban medical clinics serving primarily Black adults with low socioeconomic resources, where rates of trauma exposure are high. The present randomized pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week adapted mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group for trauma-exposed Black adults who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in an urban primary care clinic setting. METHOD: Participants were randomized to waitlist control (WLC) or MBCT. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through examination of retention rates, measures of group satisfaction and treatment barriers, and qualitative interview. Forty-two Black adults (85% women) were consented; of those, 34 (81%) completed preassessment and randomization. RESULTS: Feasibility of study design was shown, with > 75% (n = 26) of randomized participants completing the study through postassessment. Twenty-four individuals (70.5%) completed through 1-month follow-up. Results showed high levels of group acceptability across quantitative and qualitative measures. Perceived barriers to psychological treatment were high, with an average of > 6 barriers present. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate feasibility and acceptability of MBCT group interventions in urban primary care settings with trauma-exposed patients with significant psychopathology. However, substantial barriers to treatment engagement were endorsed and to improve numbers for successful engagement in the intervention, continued efforts to reduce treatment barriers and increase access to mindfulness-based interventions in underresourced communities are needed.

It is immensely important to effectively increase the posttraumatic growth level of cancer patients and improve their quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of a nurse-led mindfulness-based Tai Chi Chuan (MTCC) programme for increasing posttraumatic growth (PTG) and decreasing the perceived stress and anxiety of breast cancer survivors. METHODS: A RCT was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to either the MTCC group or the control group. The programme included 59 women with stage I-III breast cancer. Participants in the intervention group participated in a nurse-led 8-week, twice a week, one-hour per day mindfulness-based exercise programme. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured three times (T1 - before intervention; T2 - after intervention; T3 - one year after intervention) using validated scales, including the PTG inventory (PTGI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). A repeated-measure analysis of variance model was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Compared with the wait-list control group, the PTG level in the MTCC group was much higher after the 8-week intervention and the follow-up (F = 374.98, P < .000). The results showed that MTCC increased the level of PTG, and the effect persisted 1 year after intervention. In addition, PSS (F = 55.22, P < .000) and SAS (F = 148.92, P < .000) scores were significantly decreased at T2 and T3. CONCLUSION: The research preliminarily revealed that the MTCC programme was simple, effective, and more suitable to clinical nurses which should be recommended to cancer survivors to promote their recovery.",

        "title": "Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction on stress regulation and associated neurocognitive mechanisms in stressed university students: the MindRest study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress-related disorders are a growing public health concern. While stress is a natural and adaptive process, chronic exposure to stressors can lead to dysregulation and take a cumulative toll on physical and mental well-being. One approach to coping with stress and building resilience is through Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). By understanding the neural mechanisms of MBSR, we can gain insight into how it reduces stress and what drives individual differences in treatment outcomes. This study aims to establish the clinical effects of MBSR on stress regulation in a population that is susceptible to develop stress-related disorders (i.e., university students with mild to high self-reported stress), to assess the role of large-scale brain networks in stress regulation changes induced by MBSR, and to identify who may benefit most from MBSR. METHODS: This study is a longitudinal two-arm randomised, wait-list controlled trial to investigate the effects of MBSR on a preselected, Dutch university student population with elevated stress levels. Clinical symptoms are measured at baseline, post-treatment, and three months after training. Our primary clinical symptom is perceived stress, with additional measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, stress resilience, positive mental health, and stress reactivity in daily life. We investigate the effects of MBSR on stress regulation in terms of behaviour, self-report measures, physiology, and brain activity. Repetitive negative thinking, cognitive reactivity, emotional allowance, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion will be tested as potential mediating factors for the clinical effects of MBSR. Childhood trauma, personality traits and baseline brain activity patterns will be tested as potential moderators of the clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study aims to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing stress-related symptoms in a susceptible student population and crucially, to investigate its effects on stress regulation, and to identify who may benefit most from the intervention.

        "title": "Effect of blended and unguided online delivery of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus care as usual on distress among cancer patients and survivors: protocol for the three-arm parallel randomized controlled buddy trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One third of cancer patients and survivors experience psychological distress. Previous studies have shown that online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) supports cancer patients and survivors in managing distress. Lack of peer support and asynchronicity during online interventions have been reported as barriers for treatment adherence and can result in higher drop-out rates. Considering this, two new formats of eMBCT were created. The primary objective of the Buddy trial is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of blended and unguided eMBCT versus care as usual (CAU) on psychological distress among cancer patients and survivors. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on other psychological outcomes and investigating working mechanisms and treatment effect moderators. METHODS: The Buddy trial is a parallel three-armed randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to blended therapist-assisted eMBCT, unguided individual eMBCT or CAU. Eligible participants will be Dutch-speaking adult cancer patients or survivors with access to internet. The primary outcome will be psychological distress scores as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale immediately post-treatment. Secondary outcome measures include fear of cancer recurrence (FCRI), fatigue (CIS-F), rumination (RRQ), mindfulness skills (FFMQ), decentering (EQ), self-compassion (SCS-SF), positive mental health (MHCSF), health related quality of life (EQ-5D), and costs associated with psychiatric illness (TiC-P). Outcome measures will be evaluated at baseline, mid-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and three-, six-, and nine-months follow-up. Possible mediators, such as engagement with interventions (TWEETS), and moderators will be also analyzed. DISCUSSION: There is room to improve eMBCT for cancer patients prior to implementation to ensure adherence and scalability. Blended and unguided eMBCT may reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life and be easily accessible to cancer patients and survivors.

However, numerous factors influence weight management outcomes, such as genetics, biology, stress, the social and physical environment. Consequently, weight management can be hard. Self-compassion, described as treating oneself kindly in times of failure or distress, has shown promise in improving weight management outcomes. The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to examine the efficacy of an online self-compassion for weight management (SC4WM) intervention coupled with an online commercial weight management programme (WW Weight Watchers reimagined) with increasing self-compassion and improving weight management outcomes (eating behaviour, physical activity and body weight) in comparison with the WW programme only and (2) to explore whether improvements in weight management outcomes are moderated by eating restraint, weight self-stigma, perceived stress and psychological coping. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To achieve these objectives, 240 participants seeking to manage their weight were randomised to either an online behavioural commercial weight management programme (WW) or the online WW +SC4 WM intervention. Validated measures of self-compassion, stress, weight self-stigma, eating restraint, psychological coping and weight management outcomes were administered online at baseline, 4 weeks and at a 12-week follow-up. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics has been granted by the University of Auckland Health Research Ethics committee. Results will be communicated in peer-review journals, conferences and a doctoral thesis. If effective in increasing self-compassion and improving weight management outcomes, the intervention could be made more widely available to supplement behavioural weight management programmes.

        "title": "Internalized weight stigma in women with class III obesity: A randomized controlled trial of a virtual lifestyle modification intervention followed by a mindful self-compassion intervention.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internalized weight stigma (Internalized-WS) is prevalent among individuals with severe obesity, particularly women, and is associated with shame, disordered eating, and weight gain. Effective, accessible interventions that address both severe (Class-III) obesity and Internalized-WS are needed. This randomized pilot trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully-remote lifestyle modification intervention (LM) followed by mindful self-compassion training (MSC) or control. METHODS: Twenty-eight women with Class-III obesity (46.6 \u00b1 3.7 kg/m(2)) and elevated Internalized-WS were randomized to a virtually-delivered 4-month LM followed by a 2-month MSC or cooking/dietary education (CON). Psychosocial measures/weight were assessed at baseline, 4-(post-LM), 6-(post-MSC/CON), and 9-month (follow-up). RESULTS: Improvements in Internalized-WS, shame, and self-compassion were observed with LM. Mean 4-month weight loss was 6.3 \u00b1 3.7%. MSC had lower attendance and usefulness ratings versus CON. Post-MSC/CON, MSC yielded significant and/or meaningful improvements in Internalized-WS, self-compassion, and intuitive eating relative to CON. Weight loss did not differ by group at 6-month, and at 9-month trended lower in MSC versus CON. CONCLUSION: Virtual LM is feasible, acceptable, and leads to significant weight loss among women with severe obesity; MSC led to further improved Internalized-WS, self-compassion, and intuitive eating. Continued work is needed to elucidate effects of self-compassion training on Internalized-WS, its mechanisms, and linkages to cardiometabolic health and long-term weight loss.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the effectiveness of a newly developed 3-week self-compassion group intervention for enhancing resilience and well-being among female college students. METHOD: Fifty-two students were randomly assigned to either an intervention designed to teach skills of self-compassion (n = 27) or an active control group intervention in which general time management skills were taught (n = 25). Both interventions comprised 3 group meetings held over 3 weeks. To measure resilience and well-being gains, participants filled out a number of questionnaires before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Results showed that the self-compassion intervention led to significantly greater increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, optimism, and self-efficacy, as well as significantly greater decreases in rumination in comparison to the active control intervention. Whereas both interventions increased life satisfaction and connectedness, no differences were found for worry and mood. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a brief self-compassion intervention has potential for improving student resilience and well-being.",

The existential approach supports the uniqueness of each individual and helps to provide meaning to their lives. In this randomized controlled trial, we examined whether mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) and the existential approach could be combined sequentially and whether they operated antagonistically or cooperatively. Methods: One hundred thirty-seven participants aged 20 years or older without any severe mental disorders were randomly assigned (1:1), via an envelope method, to receive either 8-week MBI (N = 68) or 4-week MBI followed by 4-week existential approach (EXMIND) (N = 69). Participants were first allocated to a waiting-list group and subsequently randomized to the MBI group or EXMIND group. The primary outcome was self-compassion scale (SCS) total scores at 0, 4, and 8 weeks during intervention or waiting. The analyses were performed by linear mixed models for both primary and secondary outcomes following the intention-to-treat principle. Results: Both MBI and EXMIND groups had significantly increased SCS total scores compared to those of the waiting group, with mean SCS total scores of 2.3 (SD 3.0) in the MBI group and 2.1 (2.9) in the EXMIND group versus 0.3 (2.2) in the waiting group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MBI followed by existential approach are not antagonistic and may have cooperative effects, suggesting that EXMIND may be a useful treatment.",

        "title": "Does it matter how meditation feels? An experience sampling study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Meditation apps are the most widely used mental health apps. The precise mechanisms underlying their effects remain unclear. In particular, the degree to which affect experienced during meditation is associated with outcomes has not been established. METHOD: We used the meditation app arm of a recently completed randomized controlled trial comparing a self-guided meditation app (Healthy Minds Program) to a waitlist control. Predominantly distressed public school employees (n = 243, 80.9% with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety) reported positive and negative affect during meditation practice. Data were analyzed using two-level multivariate latent growth curve models (observations nested within participants) that simultaneously attended to both positive and negative affect. We examined whether positive and negative affect during meditation changed over time and whether these changes were associated with changes in psychological distress (parent trial's preregistered primary outcome) at posttest or 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: On average, participants reported decreased negative affect but no change in positive affect during meditation over time. Increased positive affect and decreased negative affect during meditation were associated with improvements in distress at posttest and follow-up. Change in positive affect was a stronger predictor of distress at follow-up than change in negative affect. CONCLUSIONS: Despite notions embedded within mainstream mindfulness meditation training that deemphasize the importance of the affective experience of practice (i.e., nonjudgmental awareness of present moment experience, regardless of valence), results indicate that these experiences contain signals associated with outcomes. Monitoring affect during meditation may be worthwhile to guide intervention delivery (i.e., measurement-based care, precision medicine).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-specific chronic low back pain (NCLBP) has a high incidence, which has a significant impact on a patient's body and mind and is a common condition affecting people's quality of life. Core stability exercise (CSE) is a modestly effective treatment for NCLBP; however, CSE has only been shown to be a useful treatment option in the short term. Many clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of a biopsychosocial framework to guide the management of NCLBP. Self-compassion training (SCT) is a promising psychotherapy treatment option for NCLBP; however, there is still a lack of research on CSE combined with SCT. In this study, we will seek to determine whether CSE combined with SCT is an effective treatment option for patients with NCLBP compared to CSE alone. METHODS: In this study, we will randomize 166 adults with NCLBP to a combined SCT and CSE arm or a CSE alone arm (83 participants per group). Both interventions will consist of four weekly 1.5-h group sessions of CSE supplemented by home practice. The combined group protocol also includes 2 h of SCT before CSE. Interviewers masked to the treatment assignments will assess the outcomes at 4 and 16 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcomes are back pain disability (based on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain intensity (NRS; average pain, worst pain, average pain) at 16 weeks. DISCUSSION: If SCT is found to enhance the effectiveness of CSE for patients with chronic back pain, the results of the study may promote the development of mind-body therapies for chronic low back pain.

Self-help may address some of these factors but there is a paucity of research on the efficacy of self-help for many problems, including social anxiety. The present research evaluated the efficacy of a mindfulness and acceptance-based self-help approach for the treatment of social anxiety. Individuals seeking help for social anxiety or shyness were recruited from the community. Participants (N = 117) were randomly assigned to a book (n = 58) or wait-list control condition (n = 59) on a 1:1 ratio. Hierarchical linear modelling results supported the efficacy of the self-help condition with between-group effect sizes on social anxiety outcomes ranging from .74 to .79. Significant change was also observed on self-compassion, mindfulness, acceptance, and depression. Some variables, including social anxiety and acceptance, were assessed weekly for those in the book condition. Additional participants (n = 35) were recruited for the book condition increasing the sample size to 93 for the latent change score modelling analyses. A unidirectional model was supported: increases in acceptance were associated with subsequent decreases in social anxiety. Overall these results support the use of a mindfulness and acceptance-based self-help approach for social anxiety.",

        "abstract": "There has been great interest in determining if mindfulness can be cultivated and if this cultivation leads to well-being. The current study offers preliminary evidence that at least one aspect of mindfulness, measured by the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS; K. W. Brown & R. M. Ryan, 2003), can be cultivated and does mediate positive outcomes. Further, adherence to the practices taught during the meditation-based interventions predicted positive outcomes. College undergraduates were randomly allocated between training in two distinct meditation-based interventions, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; J. Kabat-Zinn, 1990; n=15) and E. Easwaran's (1978/1991) Eight Point Program (EPP; n=14), or a waitlist control (n=15). Pretest, posttest, and 8-week follow-up data were gathered on self-report outcome measures. Compared to controls, participants in both treatment groups (n=29) demonstrated increases in mindfulness at 8-week follow-up. Further, increases in mindfulness mediated reductions in perceived stress and rumination. These results suggest that distinct meditation-based practices can increase mindfulness as measured by the MAAS, which may partly mediate benefits. Implications and future directions are discussed.",

METHOD: Randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 171) comparing TAU + MYI with TAU-only. Assessments were at baseline, postintervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures were clinician-rated and self-reported symptoms of depression, together with a diagnostic interview to establish MDD diagnosis that was restricted to the baseline and 12-month follow-up assessments. Quality of life in various domains was assessed as secondary outcome measure. As potential mediators for treatment efficacy, we included self-report measures of rumination, self-criticism, self-compassion, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived body awareness and dispositional mindfulness, together with behavioral measures of attentional bias (AB) and depression-related self-associations. RESULTS: Adding MYI to TAU did not lead to greater reduction of depression symptoms, lower rate of MDD diagnosis or increase in quality of life in various domains of functioning at post and follow-up assessments. There were no indirect effects through any of the potential mediators, with the exception of self-compassion. CONCLUSION: Adding MYI to TAU appeared not more efficacious than TAU-only in reducing depression symptoms in young women. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

Undergraduate women (N = 115) were randomly assigned to view one of three compilation TikTok videos on either beauty tips, self-compassion strategies, or travel destinations. Upward appearance comparisons and thoughts were assessed at post-test only given the items related to video exposure; all other measures were assessed at pre- and post-test. Controlling for pre-test measures, results showed that face-related appearance shame and anxiety, and negative mood were higher, whereas self-compassion was lower in the beauty group relative to the travel control and self-compassion groups. Self-compassion was higher in the self-compassion group relative to the travel control. Women in the beauty group reported more upward appearance comparisons and appearance thoughts relative to women in the travel control and self-compassion groups. The self-compassion group reported more appearance thoughts relative to the travel control. Findings contribute to prior research by showing that brief exposure to beauty TikToks may have a negative effect on how young women feel about their appearance, but also how self-compassion videos may help young women feel more compassionate toward themselves.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Specialised early intervention services have demonstrated improved outcomes in first-episode psychosis (FEP); however, clinical gains may not be sustained after patients are transferred to regular care. Moreover, many patients with FEP remain socially isolated with poor functional outcomes. To address this, our multidisciplinary team has developed a moderated online social media therapy (HORYZONS) designed to enhance social functioning and maintain clinical gains from specialist FEP services. HORYZONS merges: (1) peer-to-peer social networking; (2) tailored therapeutic interventions; (3) expert and peer-moderation; and (4) new models of psychological therapy (strengths and mindfulness-based interventions) targeting social functioning. The aim of this trial is to determine whether following 2 years of specialised support and 18-month online social media-based intervention (HORYZONS) is superior to 18 months of regular care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-blind randomised controlled trial. The treatment conditions include HORYZONS plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. We recruited 170 young people with FEP, aged 16-27 years, in clinical remission and nearing discharge from Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne. The study includes four assessment time points, namely, baseline, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up. The study is due for completion in July 2018 and included a 40-month recruitment period and an 18-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is social functioning at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include rate of hospital admissions, cost-effectiveness, vocational status, depression, social support, loneliness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, anxiety, psychological well-being, satisfaction with life, quality of life, positive and negative psychotic symptoms and substance use.

        "title": "The Role of Heart Rate Variability in Mindfulness-Based Pain Relief.",
        "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation is a self-regulatory practice premised on sustaining nonreactive awareness of arising sensory events that reliably reduces pain. Yet, the specific analgesic mechanisms supporting mindfulness have not been comprehensively disentangled from the potential nonspecific factors supporting this technique. Increased parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity is associated with pain relief corresponding to a number of cognitive manipulations. However, the relationship between the PNS and mindfulness-based pain attenuation remains unknown. The primary objective of the present study was to determine the role of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), a marker of PNS activity, during mindfulness-based pain relief as compared to a validated, sham-mindfulness meditation technique that served as a breathing-based control. Sixty-two healthy volunteers (31 females; 31 males) were randomized to a 4-session (25 min/session) mindfulness or sham-mindfulness training regimen. Before and after each group's respective training, participants were administered noxious (49\u00b0C) and innocuous (35\u00b0C) heat to the right calf. HF HRV and respiration rate were recorded during thermal stimulation and pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings were collected after each stimulation series. The primary analysis revealed that during mindfulness meditation, higher HF HRV was more strongly associated with lower pain unpleasantness ratings when compared to sham-mindfulness meditation (B = -.82, P = .04). This finding is in line with the prediction that mindfulness-based meditation engages distinct mechanisms from sham-mindfulness meditation to reduce pain. However, the same prediction was not confirmed for pain intensity ratings (B = -.41). Secondary analyses determined that mindfulness and sham-mindfulness meditation similarly reduced pain ratings, decreased respiration rate, and increased HF HRV (between group ps < .05). More mechanistic work is needed to reliably determine the role of parasympathetic activation in mindfulness-based pain relief as compared to other meditative techniques. Perspective: Mindfulness has been shown to engage multiple mechanisms to reduce pain. The present study extends on this work to show that higher HRV is associated with mindfulness-induced reductions in pain unpleasantness, but not pain intensity ratings, when compared to sham-mindfulness meditation. These findings warrant further investigation into the mechanisms engaged by mindfulness as compared to placebo.",

        "abstract": "Previous research examining the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and their mechanisms of change has been hampered by failure to control for non-specific factors, such as social support and interaction with group members, facilitator contact and expectation of benefit, meaning that it remained possible that benefits of MBIs could have been attributable, perhaps entirely, to non-specific elements. This experimental study examined the effects of a 2-week online mindfulness-based self-help (MBSH) intervention compared to a well-matched classical music control condition and a waitlist control condition on perceived stress. This study also tested mindfulness, self-compassion and worry as mechanisms of the effects of MBSH versus both control conditions on stress. University students and staff (N = 214) were randomised to MBSH, classical music, or waitlist conditions and completed self-report measures pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Post-intervention, MBSH was found to significantly reduce stress compared to both control conditions. Bootstrapping-based mediation analyses used standardised residualised change scores for all variables, with mediators computed as change from baseline to mid-intervention, and the outcome computed as change from baseline to post-intervention. Changes in mindfulness, self-compassion and worry were found to significantly mediate the effects of MBSH versus both control conditions on changes in stress. Findings suggest that cultivating mindfulness specifically confers benefits to stress and that these benefits may occur through improving theorised mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Tong Len meditation is an important therapeutic tool in the Tibetan medicine, and it can be used for self-healing and/or to heal others. Currently, in the West, there is no scientific study concerning the efficacy of a Tong Len distant healing effect on psychological disorders in cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a distant healing effect of Tong Len meditation on stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and self-perceived quality of life in cancer patients. These psychological objectives were chosen as a consequence of the limited scientific literature of present day. DESIGN: We performed a double-blind randomized controlled trial on 103 cancer patients with tumors. Overall, 12 meditators used Tong Len in aid of 52 patients randomly selected as experimental group, while the remaining 51 patients constituted the control group. Patients and meditators did not know each other. All patients completed profile of mood states (POMS) and European Quality of Life-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires before treatment (T0), after two (T1) and three months of treatment (T2), and one month after treatment cessation (T3). RESULTS: With regard to the parameters related to depression, a statistically significant improvement (P = .003) was observed in the treatment group compared to controls. On the other hand, the vigor/activity parameter saw significant improvements in the control group (P = .009). Both groups exhibited significant improvements in the other factors assessed in the POMS and EQ-5D questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide sufficient evidence supporting an efficacy of Tong Len meditation in distant psychological healing as compared to a control condition. The research highlighted some psychological improvements through Tong Len distant meditation in a group of patients unknown to meditators. Therefore, the enhancement detected in most parameters in both treatment and control groups raises interest on in-depth analysis and evaluation of distant meditation on cancer patients to mitigate psychological problems caused by the disease.",

This study assessed the effectiveness of a training program for primary health care professionals designed to reduce burnout and mood disturbance, increase empathy, and develop mindfulness. METHODS: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial with pre- and postintervention measurements of 68 primary health care professionals (43 in the intervention and 25 in the control group) in Spain. The intervention consisted of presentations of clinically relevant topics, mindfulness-based coping strategies, mindfulness practice, yoga, and group discussions (8 sessions of 2.5 hours per week plus a 1-day session of 8 hours). Outcome measures included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Profile of Mood States, Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Baer's Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on changes in personal habits and mindfulness practice. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: The intervention group improved in the 4 scales measured. The magnitude of the change was large in total mood disturbance (difference between groups -7.1; standardized effect-size [SES] 1.15) and mindfulness (difference between groups 11; SES 0.9) and moderate in the burnout (difference between groups -7; SES 0.74) and empathy scales (difference between groups 5.2; SES 0.71). No significant differences were found in the control group. DISCUSSION: Our study supports the use of mindfulness-based programs as part of continuing professional education to reduce and prevent burnout, promote positive attitudes among health professionals, strengthen patient-provider relationships, and enhance well-being.",

        "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) has been shown to be associated with difficulty in the ability to vicariously share others' positive emotions (positive affective empathy). Mixed evidence also suggests potentially impaired recognition of the positive and negative emotions of others (cognitive empathy) and impaired or enhanced sharing of the negative emotions of others (negative affective empathy). Therefore, we examined whether two efficacious treatments for SAD, cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), improve empathy in SAD relative to a wait-list condition and whether improvements in empathy mediate improvements in social anxiety. In the context of a randomized controlled trial, participants with SAD completed an empathy task at baseline, posttreatment/wait-list (N = 81), and 1-year follow-up (N = 37). Relative to both MBSR and wait-list, CBGT resulted in significant improvements in positive affective empathy. CBGT-related changes in positive affective empathy also mediated improvements in social anxiety at both posttreatment/wait-list and at 1-year follow-up. Other indices of empathy did not change differentially across the three conditions. Therefore, one way in which CBGT may specifically confer benefits to individuals with SAD is through increasing their ability or willingness to share in the positive emotions of others.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer survivors (MBSR(BC)) on multiple measures of objective and subjective sleep parameters among breast cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: Data were collected using a two-armed randomized controlled design among BCS enrolled in either a 6-week MBSR(BC) program or a usual care (UC) group with a 12-week follow-up. The present analysis is a subset of the larger parent trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01177124). Seventy-nine BCS participants (mean age 57 years), stages 0-III, were randomly assigned to either the formal (in-class) 6-week MBSR(BC) program or UC. Subjective sleep parameters (SSP) (i.e., sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) and objective sleep parameters (OSP) (i.e., actigraphy) were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after completing the MBSR(BC) or UC program. RESULTS: Results showed indications of a positive effect of MBSR(BC) on OSP at 12 weeks on sleep efficiency (78.2% MBSR(BC) group versus 74.6% UC group, p = 0.04), percent of sleep time (81.0% MBSR(BC) group versus 77.4% UC group, p = 0.02), and less number waking bouts (93.5 in MBSR(BC) group versus 118.6 in the UC group, p < 0.01). Small nonsignificant improvements were found in SSP in the MBSR(BC) group from baseline to 6 weeks (PSQI total score, p = 0.09). No significant relationship was observed between minutes of MBSR(BC) practice and SSP or OSP. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MBSR(BC) may be an efficacious treatment to improve objective and subjective sleep parameters in BCS.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evidence links depression and stress to more rapid progression of HIV-1 disease. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test whether an intervention aimed at improving stress management and emotion regulation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), would improve immunological (i.e. CD4+ T-cell counts) and psychological outcomes in persons with HIV-1 infection. METHODS: We randomly assigned participants with HIV-1 infection and CD4 T-cell counts >350 cells/\u03bcl who were not on antiretroviral therapy in a 1:1 ratio to either an MBSR group (n = 89) or an HIV disease self-management skills group (n = 88). The study was conducted at the University of California at San Francisco. We assessed immunologic (CD4, c-reactive protein, IL-6, and d-dimer) and psychological measures (Beck Depression Inventory for depression, modified Differential Emotions Scale for positive and negative affect, Perceived stress-scale, and mindfulness) at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of the intervention; we used multiple imputation to address missing values. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant improvements from baseline to 3-months within the MBSR group in depression, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, and mindfulness; between group differences in change were significantly greater in the MBSR group only for positive affect (per item difference on DES-positive 0.25, 95% CI 0.049, 0.44, p = .015). By 12 months the between group difference in positive affect was not statistically significant, although both groups had trends toward improvements compared to baseline in several psychological outcomes that were maintained at 12-months; these improvements were only statistically significant for depression and negative affect in the MBSR group and perceived stress for the control group. The groups did not differ significantly on rates of antiretroviral therapy initiation (MBSR = 39%, control = 29%, p = .22). After 12 months, the mean decrease in CD4+ T-cell count was 49.6 cells/\u03bcl in participants in the MBSR arm, compared to 54.2 cells/\u03bcl in the control group, a difference of 4.6 cells favoring the MBSR group (95% CI, -44.6, 53.7, p = .85). The between group differences in other immunologic-related outcomes (c-reactive protein, IL-6, HIV-1 viral load, and d-dimer) were not statistically significant at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR improved positive affect more than an active control arm in the 3 months following the start of the intervention. However, this difference was not maintained over the 12-month follow-up and there were no significant differences in immunologic outcomes between intervention groups. These results emphasize the need for further carefully designed research if we are to translate evidence linking psychological states to immunological outcomes into evidence-based clinical practices.",

        "abstract": "Background: There is ample evidence of the high mental health burden caused by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Several constructs such as experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have recently emerged as potential intervention targets to improve mental health in IBD. Psychotherapeutic models such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based interventions are known to target these constructs. In this protocol, we aim to describe a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of an ACT and compassion-focused intervention named Living with Intention, Fullness, and Engagement with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (LIFEwithIBD) intervention + Treatment As Usual (TAU) vs. TAU in improving psychological distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, self-compassion, disease activity, inflammation biomarkers, and gut microbiota diversity. Methods: This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03840707, date assigned 13/02/2019). The LIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation to the IBD population of the Mind programme for people with cancer, an acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered in a group format. The LIFEwithIBD intervention's structure and topics are presented in this protocol. Participants were recruited at the Gastroenterology Service of the Coimbra University Hospital between June and September 2019. Of the 355 patients screened, 61 participants were selected, randomly assigned to one of two conditions [experimental group (LIFEwithIBD + TAU) or control group (TAU)] and completed the baseline assessment. Outcome measurement took place at baseline, post-intervention, 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Discussion: Results from this RCT will support future studies testing the LIFEwithIBD intervention or other acceptance and/or compassion-based interventions for IBD.",

        "title": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for multiple chemical sensitivity: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a condition characterized by recurrent, self-reported symptoms from multiple organ systems, attributable to exposure to a wide range of chemically unrelated substances at low levels. The pathophysiology is unknown, and affected individuals generally favor avoidance of the symptom triggering substances as a coping strategy. The impact of MCS on daily life may thus be severe. An intervention that may effectively reduce the impact of MCS, alleviate the symptoms and the psychological distress associated with the condition is therefore highly needed. In this study we will assess the effects of a mindfulness-based cognitive (MBCT) program on MCS. METHODS/DESIGN: Using a randomized controlled design (RCT), we will compare MBCT with treatment as usual (TAU). The MBCT intervention will include 8 weekly 2.5 hour sessions, and 45 minutes of mindfulness home practice 6 days each week. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6 and 12 months' follow-up. Based on sample size estimation, 82 participants will be randomized to either the MBCT intervention or to TAU. The primary outcome will be a measure of the impact of MCS on the participants' lives. The secondary outcome measures are physical symptoms of psychological distress, perceived stress, illness perceptions, QOL, and work ability. Lastly, we will assess whether any effect of MBCT on the primary effect measure is mediated by level of mindfulness, self-compassion, perceived stress, and rumination. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide important information on the effects of MBCT on MCS. TRIALS REGISTRATION: Clinical trials identifier NCT01240395.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is concern that increasing demand for student mental health services reflects deteriorating student well-being. We designed a pragmatic, parallel, single-blinded randomised controlled trial hypothesising that providing mindfulness courses to university students would promote their resilience to stress up to a year later. Here we present 1-year follow-up outcomes. METHODS: University of Cambridge students without severe mental illness or crisis were randomised (1:1, remote software-generated random numbers), to join an 8-week mindfulness course adapted for university students (Mindfulness Skills for Students (MSS)), or to mental health support as usual (SAU). RESULTS: We randomised 616 students; 53% completed the 1-year follow-up questionnaire. Self-reported psychological distress and mental well-being improved in the MSS arm for up to 1 year compared to SAU (p<0.001). Effects were smaller than during the examination period. No significant differences between arms were detected in the use of University Counselling Service and other support resources, but there was a trend for MSS participants having milder needs. There were no differences in students' workload management; MSS participants made more donations. Home practice had positive dose-response effects; few participants meditated. No adverse effects related to self-harm, suicidality or harm to others were detected. CONCLUSION: Loss to follow-up is a limitation, but evidence suggests beneficial effects on students' average psychological distress that last for at least a year. Effects are on average larger at stressful times, consistent with the hypothesis that this type of mindfulness training increases resilience to stress.

The two-week intervention was provided by email.Main Outcome Measures: Treatment adherence and attrition rates were calculated, and effectiveness was estimated using measures of perceived stress, anxiety, depression, dermatology-specific quality of life and self-compassion.Results: Eighty-seven participants completed the post-intervention questionnaires (51%), and practiced on a median of 9/14 days. Study completers demonstrated significant, moderate improvements on measures of stress, anxiety, depression, self-compassion and dermatology-specific quality of life, relative to controls. In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, these findings remained significant, however effect sizes reduced from moderate to small.Conclusions: The findings indicate that CFT self-help shows promise in the treatment of psychological distress associated with skin conditions, however further testing of the intervention is not feasible without significant methodological changes, including the method of treatment delivery. Future studies should also include a follow-up period, as the duration of treatment effects could not be shown.",

        "title": "The Role of Daily Steps in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial of a 6-Month Internet-Based, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Youth.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports physical activity (PA) as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between objectively measured PA and MDD treatment outcomes using prospective data. OBJECTIVE: This study is a secondary analysis of data from a 24-week internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for MDD. The purpose of this analysis was twofold: (1) to examine average daily step counts in relation to MDD symptom improvement, and whether pain moderated this relationship; and (2) to examine whether changes in step activity (ie, step trajectories) during treatment were associated with baseline symptoms and symptom improvement. METHODS: Patients from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health were part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy for young adults (aged 18-30 years old) with MDD. Data from 20 participants who had completed the intervention were analyzed. PA, in the form of objectively measured steps, was measured using the Fitbit-HR Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc), and self-reported depression severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Linear regression analysis was used to test PA's relationship with depression improvement and the moderating effect of pain severity and pain interference. Growth curve and multivariable regression models were used to test longitudinal associations. RESULTS: Participants walked an average of 8269 steps per day, and each additional +1000-step difference between participants was significantly associated with a 2.66-point greater improvement (reduction) in BDI-II, controlling for anxiety, pain interference, and adherence to Fitbit monitoring (P=.02). Pain severity appeared to moderate (reduce) the positive effect of average daily steps on BDI-II improvement (P=.03). Higher baseline depression and anxiety symptoms predicted less positive step trajectories throughout treatment (Ps<=.001), and more positive step trajectories early in the trial predicted greater MDD improvement at the end of the trial (Ps<.04). However, step trajectories across the full duration of the trial did not significantly predict MDD improvement (Ps=.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study used objective measurements to demonstrate positive associations between PA and depression improvement in the context of cognitive behavioral treatment. Pain appeared to moderate this relationship, and baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted PA trajectories. The findings inform future interventions for major depression. Future research with larger samples should consider additional moderators of PA-related treatment success and the extent to which outcomes are related to PA change in multimodal interventions.

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Caregivers of people with mental illness are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a compassion cultivation training (CCT) program on decreasing caregiver psychological distress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This waitlist-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2 different community settings in Denmark. Caregivers were excluded if they had a diagnosed and untreated mental illness, addiction, meditation practice, or current psychotherapeutic treatment. Enrollment occurred between May 2018 and March 2019. A repeated measurement model was used to examine the impact of the intervention. The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. Data analysis was conducted from June 4 to July 7, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1-to-1 to an 8-week CCT course or waitlist control. Block randomization was used with 40 participants in each block. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was reduction in psychological distress, as measured by the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS). Baseline, postintervention, and 3- and 6-month follow-up measurements were collected. RESULTS: Among 192 participants assessed for eligibility, 161 participants were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 52.6 [12.5] years; 142 [88.2%] women), with 79 participants randomized to the CCT intervention and 82 participants in the waitlist control group. At baseline, the mean (SD) DASS scores for the intervention vs control groups were 10.89 (8.66) vs 10.80 (8.38) for depression, 6.89 (6.48) vs 6.68 (5.33) for anxiety, and 14.96 (7.90) vs 15.77 (7.40) for stress. The CCT group experienced statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome in mean change from baseline vs the control group at postintervention (adjusted mean difference: depression, -4.16 [95% CI, -6.75 to -1.58]; P = .002; anxiety, -2.24 [95% CI, -3.99 to -0.48]; P = .01; stress, -4.20 [95% CI, -6.73 to -1.67]; P = .001), the 3-month follow-up (adjusted mean difference: depression, -3.78 [95% CI, -6.40 to -1.17]; P = .005; anxiety, -2.50 [95% CI, -4.27 to -0.73]; P = .006; stress, -3.76 [95% CI, -6.32 to -1.21]; P = .004), and the 6-month follow-up (adjusted mean difference: depression: -4.24 [95% CI, -6.97 to -1.52]; P = .002; anxiety, -2.12 [95% CI, -3.96 to -0.29]; P = .02; stress: -3.79 [95% CI, -6.44 to -1.13]; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that CCT was superior to the waitlist control in supporting caregivers' mental health. Statistically and clinically significant reductions in psychological distress were found and sustained at the 6-month follow-up. The improvements noted in this randomized clinical trial could serve to encourage implementation of future evidence-based programs for caregivers.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated stress can exacerbate cancer symptom severity, and after completion of primary cancer treatments, many individuals continue to have significant distress. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is an 8-week group psychosocial intervention consisting of training in mindfulness meditation and yoga designed to mitigate stress, pain, and chronic illness. Efficacy research shows face-to-face (F2F) MBCR programs have positive benefits for cancer patients; however barriers exist that impede participation in F2F groups. While online MBCR groups are available to the public, none have been evaluated. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: determine whether underserved patients are willing to participate in and complete an online MBCR program. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: determine whether online MBCR will mirror previous efficacy findings from F2F MBCR groups on patient-reported outcomes. METHOD/DESIGN: The study includes cancer patients in Alberta, exhibiting moderate distress, who do not have access to F2F MBCR. Participants will be randomized to either online MBCR, or waiting for the next available group. An anticipated sample size of 64 participants will complete measures online pre and post treatment or waiting period. Feasibility will be tracked through monitoring numbers eligible and participating through each stage of the protocol. DISCUSSION: 47 have completed/completing the intervention.

        "title": "A RCT of psychotherapy in women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.",
        "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Does adding psychological intervention to medical therapy improve nausea/vomiting, psychological symptoms, and pregnancy distress in women with moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Three weeks of medical therapy plus psychotherapy yielded statistically and clinically significant improvements in NVP-specific symptoms, anxiety/depression symptoms, and pregnancy distress, compared with medical therapy alone. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnancy with nausea/vomiting is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Evidence supports the exploration of psychosocial reactions in addition to biochemical markers related to NVP. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study was performed at two obstetrics clinics in Iran. A total of 86 women, aged 18-40 years, between 6 and 12 weeks pregnant with moderate NVP, more than 5 years of education, and not currently practicing any relaxation techniques or undergoing any psychotherapy, were enrolled from June 2013 to November 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 86 moderate NVP women were randomly allocated to either a control (medical therapy alone) or experimental (medical therapy plus psychotherapy) group. Block randomization was achieved using a paper list prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. The experimental group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily) for 3 weeks, and also received intensive mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in eight individual sessions (50 min each) over 3 weeks. The control group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily tablet) for 3 weeks alone. All participants completed the Rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and retching (RINVR), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the prenatal distress questionnaire (PDQ) at baseline, 3 weeks after baseline at the end of the study, and at a 1 month post-treatment follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were used, in an intention-to-treat analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: In the psychotherapy plus medical therapy group, the mean relative difference between baseline and post-treatment decreased for RINVR; nausea 8.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1, 10.2), vomiting 3.5 (95% CI 1.5, 5.8), and total RINVR 11.7 (95% CI 6.5, 16.5), for HADS; anxiety 5.1 (95% CI 3.2, 9.2), depression 3.5 (95% CI 2.4, 7.3), total HADS 7.2 (95% CI 4.4, 12.1), for PDQ; birth concerns 3.3 (95% CI 1.3, 9.1), body concerns 1.5 (95% CI 0.9, 5.1), relationship concerns 2.1 (95% CI 1.2, 5.9), and total PDQ 5.9 (95% CI 3.5, 10.6). At 1 month after treatment, the statistically significant improvement in RINVR, HADS and PDQ, as well as clinical improvement in severity of symptoms, persisted. Medical therapy plus psychotherapy also improved nausea/vomiting symptoms, psychological symptoms, and reduced pregnancy distress more than medical therapy alone, with an effect size of 0.42-0.72 over the trial period. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The conclusions were limited to a small number of women with moderate NVP. It is unclear whether the difference between the outcomes in the different groups was related to MBCT alone, or to the extra time and attention paid to patients in the medical therapy plus psychotherapy. The participants in the study did not remain blind to the treatment and the outcome may only be representative of women with moderate NVP who have been referred to obstetrics clinics. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings show that adding 3 weeks of psychological intervention to medical therapy may appear to produce positive therapeutic outcomes upon conclusion of treatment, and 1 month after treatment. This suggests that psychotherapy should be considered as an adjunctive treatment option for women with moderate NVP. In future studies, however, a group of patients who are receiving placebo psychotherapy along with medical treatment should be included. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of the addition of psychological intervention to standard medical therapy would be useful.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the EEG pattern generated during the practice of this mindfulness exercise, and compare it to music listening which has been shown to induce positive emotions. METHODS: Nineteen college students (aged 19-22 years) participated in the study. Each participant listened to both the TBRT and music audiotapes while EEG was recorded. The order of presentation was counterbalanced to avoid order effect. Two EEG indicators were used: (1) alpha asymmetry index, an indicator for left-sided anterior activation, as measure of positive emotions, and (2) frontal midline theta activity, as a measure for internalized attention. RESULTS: Increased left-sided activation, a pattern associated with positive emotions, was found during both TBRT exercise and music conditions. However, only TBRT exercise was shown to exhibit greater frontal midline theta power, a pattern associated with internalized attention. CONCLUSIONS: These results provided evidence to support that the TBRT gives rise to positive emotional experience, accompanied by focused internalized attention.",

        "title": "A pilot and feasibility study of a randomized clinical trial testing a self-compassion intervention aimed to increase physical activity behaviour among people with prediabetes.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seventy-five per cent of individuals with prediabetes will eventually be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Physical activity is a cornerstone in reducing type 2 diabetes risk but can be a challenging behaviour to adopt for those living with prediabetes. Individuals with prediabetes experience difficult emotions associated with being at risk for a chronic disease, which can undermine self-regulation. Self-compassion enhances self-regulation because it mitigates difficult emotions and promotes adaptive coping. We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a self-compassion informed intervention to increase physical activity for persons with prediabetes. METHODS: This explanatory mixed methods study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a two-arm, randomized, single-blind, actively controlled, 6-week online intervention. Using a 1:1 allocation ratio, participants (identified as people with prediabetes, low physical activity, and low self-compassion) were randomized to a self-compassion (M(age) = 60.22 years) or control condition (M(age) = 56.13 years). All participants received behaviour change education (e.g. SMART goals, action-coping planning) and either other health knowledge (control condition: e.g. sleep, benefits of water) or self-compassion training (intervention condition: practising mindfulness, writing a letter to themselves offering the same support that they would offer to a friend). The primary outcome was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the trial. To be considered feasible, our outcomes needed to meet or surpass our pre-determined criteria (e.g. time for group formation: 14-20 participants per month). Feasibility was assessed by examining the recruitment rates, retention, adherence, fidelity, and capacity. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to determine trial acceptability. As a secondary purpose, we examined the means on key study variables (secondary and exploratory variables; see Table 1) at all planned time points (baseline, intervention-end, 6- and 12-week follow-up) to identify if they are suitable to include in the efficacy trial (see Additional Table 3). RESULTS: Eighteen participants were screened and randomized to one of two conditions. Retention, instructor fidelity, safety, capacity, adherence to most of the study aspects, and acceptability by participants and facilitators all met the criteria for feasibility. Recruitment rate, process time, and adherence to home practice were below our criteria, and we offer ways to address these shortcomings for the efficacy trial. CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that it should be feasible to deliver our intervention while highlighting the alterations to components that may be altered when delivering the efficacy trial. We outline our changes which should improve and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of our planned intervention.

        "title": "eLIFEwithIBD: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of an online acceptance and commitment therapy and compassion-based intervention in inflammatory bowel disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) entails physical, psychological, and social burden and holds a significant impact on quality of life. Experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have been identified as possible therapeutic targets for improving mental health in people with IBD. Traditional face-to-face psychological therapy continues to provide obstacles for patients seeking assistance. Online psychological therapies centered on acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion have been shown to improve psychological distress in other populations. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the study protocol of a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of an ACT and compassion-based, online intervention - eLIFEwithIBD - on the improvement of psychological distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, and self-compassion. METHODS: The eLIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation of the LIFEwithIBD programme (delivered through an in-person group format) and entails an ACT, mindfulness, and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered as an e-health tool for people with IBD. This protocol outlines the structure and contents of the eLIFEwithIBD intervention. Participants were recruited by an advertisement on the social media platforms of Portuguese Associations for IBD in January 2022. A psychologist conducted a brief interview with 80 patients who were interested in participating. Fifty-five participants were selected and randomly assigned to one of two conditions [experimental group (eLIFEwithIBD + medical TAU; n = 37) or control group (medical TAU; n = 18)]. Outcome measurement took place at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-month follow-up. All analyses are planned as intent-to-treat (ITT). RESULTS: The eLIFEwithIBD intervention is expected to empower people with IBD by fostering psychological strategies that promote illness adjustment and well-being and prevent subsequent distress. The eLIFEwithIBD aims to gain a novel and better understanding of the role of online contextual behavioral interventions on improving the quality of life and mental health of people with IBD.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Elevated fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive evaluation (FPE) are thought to play key roles in the maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although efficacious therapies exist for SAD, the potential mediating and moderating effects of FNE and FPE on social anxiety treatment outcome have not been examined. METHODS: This sample comprised a secondary analysis of 210 individuals who participated in one of three randomized controlled trials for the treatment of SAD. Participants were randomized to: individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), group CBT, community mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), group MBSR, or they were randomized to waitlist and offered treatment after waitlist. Assessments were completed pre- and post-treatment/waitlist and, for the treatment groups, at three-month follow-up. RESULTS: CBT and MBSR led to greater reductions in FNE and FPE than waitlist, with CBT more efficacious in reducing FPE than MBSR. For both CBT (vs. waitlist) and MBSR (vs. waitlist), there were significant indirect effects on post-treatment social anxiety through both FNE and FPE, and the indirect effect through FPE was greater for CBT than MBSR. However, in the fully longitudinal model testing mediation, CBT and MBSR were not differentially mediated by FPE. Baseline FNE and FPE each moderated CBT treatment outcome compared to waitlist - higher baseline FNE and FPE were associated with higher baseline social anxiety and greater reductions in social anxiety during CBT. DISCUSSION: FNE and FPE contributed in sometimes similar and sometimes distinct ways to the mediation and moderation of psychosocial approaches for treating SAD. This supports the importance of distinguishing between fears of negative and positive evaluation in the assessment and treatment of SAD.",

        "title": "Healthy learning mind - Effectiveness of a mindfulness program on mental health compared to a relaxation program and teaching as usual in schools: A cluster-randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) have shown promising effects on mental health among children and adolescents, but high-quality studies examining the topic are lacking. The present study assessed the effects of MBI on mental health in school-setting in an extensive randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Finnish school children and adolescents (N = 3519), aged 12-15 years (6th to 8th graders), from 56 schools were randomized into a 9 week MBI group, and control groups with a relaxation program or teaching as usual. The primary outcomes were resilience, socio-emotional functioning, and depressive symptoms at baseline, at completion of the programs at 9 weeks (T9), and at follow-up at 26 weeks (T26). RESULTS: Overall, mindfulness did not show more beneficial effects on the primary outcomes compared to the controls except for resilience for which a positive intervention effect was found at T9 in all participants (beta=1.18, SE 0.57, p = 0.04) as compared to the relaxation group. In addition, in gender and grade related analyses, MBI lowered depressive symptoms in girls at T26 (beta=-0.49, SE 0.21, p = 0.02) and improved socio-emotional functioning at T9 (beta=-1.37, SE 0.69, p = 0.049) and at T26 (beta=-1.71, SE 0.73, p = 0.02) among 7th graders as compared to relaxation. LIMITATIONS: The inactive control group was smaller than the intervention and active control groups, reducing statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: A short 9-week MBI in school-setting provides slight benefits over a relaxation program and teaching as usual. Future research should investigate whether embedding regular mindfulness-based practice in curriculums could intensify the effects.",

        "abstract": "The global population is aging while modern healthcare systems are responding with limited success to the growing care demands of the senior population. Capitalizing on recent technological advancements, new ways to improve older adults' quality of life have recently been implemented. The current study investigated, from a qualitative point of view, the utility of a mindfulness-based smartphone application for older adults. A description of the older adults' experience with the smartphone application designed to enhance well-being and mindfulness will be presented. Participants'general beliefs about the benefits of technology for personal well-being will also be discussed. 68 older adults were recruited from different education centers for seniors. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: a) a treatment group, which received the smartphone application intervention (n = 34), or b) a waitlist control group (n = 34). The experimental intervention included the utilization of a smartphone app designed specifically for improving older adult well-being and mindfulness levels. Participants completed semi-structured interviews evaluating participants' treatment experience and technology-acceptance at recruitment (T0, baseline) and post-intervention (T1, post-intervention). Through thematic analysis, four themes were identified from verbatim responses of both interviews: Utility of technology for health, Impressions of technology, Mindful-benefits of smartphone application usage, and Smartphone application usage as a means to improve interpersonal relationships. Participants showed a positive experience of the app intervention. Qualitative analysis underlined the main Mindfulness-benefits reported by participants and the potentially crucial role of \"Langerian\" mindfulness in the relationship between older adults and health technology.",

METHOD: Participants who completed the study consisted of 82 patients diagnosed with Stage 0-III BC, who received lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation \u00b1 chemotherapy. Patients were randomized into an MBSR(BC) intervention program or a control (usual care) group. Immune cell measures were assessed at baseline and within 2 weeks after the 6-week intervention. The numbers and percentages of lymphocyte subsets, activated T cells, and Th1 and Th2 cells in peripheral blood samples were determined by immunostaining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immune subset recovery after cancer treatment showed positive associations with time since treatment completion. The B and natural killer (NK) cells were more susceptible than T cells in being suppressed by cancer treatment. Women who received MBSR(BC) had T cells more readily activated by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and an increase in the Th1/Th2 ratio. Activation was also higher for the MBSR(BC) group if <12 weeks from the end of treatment and women in MBSR(BC) <12 weeks had higher T cell count for CD4(+). CONCLUSION: MBSR(BC) promotes a more rapid recovery of functional T cells capable of being activated by a mitogen with the Th1 phenotype, whereas substantial recovery of B and NK cells after completion of cancer treatment appears to occur independent of stress-reducing interventions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a structured mindfulness group intervention program targeting deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) in a sample of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: Seventy-two children aged 7 to 12 years with ADHD were randomized into 2 groups (mindfulness and control). The dysregulation profile was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Attention/Anxiety-Depression/Aggression scales. RESULTS: Children with ADHD who received mindfulness-based group therapy showed lower levels of DESR after treatment, with a reduction in CBCL dysregulation profile (F (1,63) = 4.81; p = 0.032). All ADHD symptoms showed a moderately significant positive correlation with DESR (p < 0.01). Children with combined-type showed higher levels of DESR than children with inattentive-type (p = 0.018); however, no statistically significant changes were observed in the combined-type after mindfulness treatment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mindfulness in the form of structured group therapy might be clinically relevant in treating children with ADHD and thus make an impact on the overall clinical outcome, regardless of the ADHD subtype.",

        "abstract": "As one of the frontline professionals during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, social workers can face tremendous pressure, which can lead to mental health problems. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a brief mindfulness-based intervention had short- and middle-term effects on social workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a randomized controlled trial, 49 social workers were assigned to an experimental group (n = 28) or a waitlist control group (n = 21). The intervention was a four-week mindfulness-based program. The outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-test, and at one-month follow-up test. At post-test and follow-up, the workers in the experimental group reported higher mean scores in psychological flexibility and self-compassion and lower mean scores in depression compared to the workers in the waitlist control group. Although the experimental group also showed lower mean scores than the waitlist control group in anxiety and stress at both post-test and follow, the differences were not statistically significant. The findings suggest that a brief mindfulness-based intervention can improve psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and depression in social workers working during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to protected mental health, adding support to continuing development of such efficient mindfulness-based programs. Future studies should use larger samples and examine brief interventions' working mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Background: Yoga may pose a promising complementary therapy in the multimodal treatment of in-patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, to date, no studies have qualitatively examined in-patients' with SSD experiences of Yoga as well as their perceptions of its limitations and benefits as a treatment component. This qualitative study aimed to explore for the first time the mechanisms and processes of Yoga-based Group Intervention (YoGI) for in-patients with SSD in Germany by asking for their subjective experiences. Findings could serve as a preliminary basis for developing an effective and evidence-based YoGI manual tailored to this patient group. Materials and Methods: In total, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted directly after YoGI, for which responses were either noted down by hand or audio-recorded. The interview guide was pilot-tested and consisted of 14 questions to explore the personal articulated experiences of participation in YoGI from in-patients with SSD. Positive, negative, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were assessed during a diagnostic interview and through questionnaires. The interview data was transcribed, coded by two independent researchers, and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. The research team collaboratively discussed emerging categories to reduce redundancy and form meaningful themes and subthemes. Results: The analysis revealed seven main themes. YoGI was perceived as feasible and focusing on individual adaptation, captured by the theme inclusivity. Nevertheless, participants encountered challenges; thus, physical limitations need to be considered. While practising together, participants experienced interconnectedness and developed a mindful stance as they accepted their limitations and adapted exercises with self-compassion. Patients described that following the flow of the asanas required physical persistence, which ultimately led many participants to experience confidence and relaxation. YoGI affected symptom representation as heightened awareness led participants to notice impeding as well as improved symptoms. Conclusion: YoGI showed various promising effects on in-patients with SSD. Future research should examine to what extent these effects can be sustained and how the mindful approach during YoGI can be transferred to areas outside the Yoga class. Furthermore, a randomised controlled trial could investigate the effectiveness of a manualised YoGI.",

This secondary objective was to examine the effectiveness of MBSWSC at improving a number of potentially important mindfulness-based programme mechanisms of action, including mindfulness, attention regulation (decentering), acceptance, self-compassion, non-attachment, aversion, worry and rumination. A randomised controlled trial with repeated measures (pre-post intervention) was conducted to evaluate the effects of MBSWSC against an active control. The active control was a modified mindfulness-based programme which focussed on supporting increases in mindfulness and self-compassion in social workers with a view to improving the same primary study outcomes. Sixty-two participants were randomly allocated to MBSWSC (n = 33) or the active control (n = 29). When compared to the active control group, the MBSWSC programme was found to be significantly superior at improving stress, emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and depression. MBSWSC was also superior to the active control at improving acceptance, mindfulness, non-attachment, attention regulation (decentering) and worry of the social workers in this study. The results suggest that MBSWSC is a very useful therapeutic programme, which has the capacity to improve a range of important mental health and well-being outcomes for social workers. The results also indicate that the MBSWSC programme has the capacity to improve a range of important mindfulness-based mechanisms of action.

        "title": "Teaching Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Self-Compassion (TADS) to Reduce Diabetes Distress: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescents living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience diabetes distress (DD), a construct distinct from depression or anxiety that refers to the negative emotions that arise from living with and managing diabetes. Self-compassion, which involves being open to one's own suffering and treating oneself with the same care one would show to loved ones, is associated with better psychological and clinical outcomes among individuals with T1D. Self-compassion is a skill that can be taught and therefore represents an opportunity for intervention. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a web-based mindful self-compassion for teens (MSC-T) intervention on improving DD, anxiety, depression, diabetes-related disordered eating, and suicidal ideation experienced by youth with T1D (aged between 12 and 17 years) compared with a waitlist control group (standard of care). We will also explore (1) if the effect of the MSC-T intervention changes over time, (2) if the MSC-T intervention has a positive impact on measures of glycemic control, and (3) if the effect of the MSC-T intervention differs based on self-reported gender. METHODS: We will conduct a single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial of 140 adolescents with T1D followed for 12 months. Participants will be randomly allocated (using hidden allocation) in a 1:1 ratio to either the MSC-T intervention or the waitlist control group. Our primary outcome is DD, as measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes-Teen (PAID-T) version at 3 months. Secondary outcomes, assessed at 3 and 12 months, include anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), diabetes-related disordered eating (Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised [DEPS-R] version), and suicidal ideation (using 1 question from the PHQ-9). RESULTS: Study recruitment began in October 2022 and was completed in March 2023, with a total of 141 participants enrolling. Data collection will be ongoing until March 2024. The first results are expected in June 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be the first randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of the web-based MSC-T intervention on adolescents with T1D. Given that adolescence is a period where individuals are typically required to assume more responsibility for their diabetes care, providing adolescents with the tools they need to better manage the stress that often accompanies T1D management is paramount.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Weight regain after bariatric surgery remains a relevant and worrisome topic, requiring greater understanding and involvement in research into new adjuvant treatments. This study aims to compare the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy programs as opposed to usual treatments (workshops) on the eating behavior of patients with progressive weight gain after bariatric surgery in Brazilian patients at a private clinic. It was hypothesized that both interventions are feasible and that the self-compassion program may be more effective than the mindfulness program. METHODS: The study will be divided into two phases: a cross-analytical study of those who underwent bariatric surgery and a randomized controlled trial only with the ones who had weight regain. Interventions will be conducted for eight weeks synchronously with three assessment points (baseline, post intervention, and 6-month follow-up), both online. The primary outcome will be a change in eating behavior. Secondary outcomes will include improved quality of life, enhanced body image satisfaction and reduced distortion (Brazilian Silhouette Scales for adults), better weight management (maintenance or weight reduction), increased frequency of activity and monitoring with the surgery team. Qualitative data will also be collected by online identification of a sub-sample of participants. RESULTS: Improvements are expected in eating behavior, weight, reverse progressive weight gain, classification of self-image, quality of life, and levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study seeks to gather preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness and compassion training for the adjunctive treatment of progressive weight gain in post-bariatric patients.

        "title": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy vs Mindfulness in Treatment of Prolonged Grief Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Although grief-focused cognitive behavior therapies are the most empirically supported treatment for prolonged grief disorder, many people find this treatment difficult. A viable alternative for treatment is mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative efficacies of grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to reduce prolonged grief disorder severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial was conducted among adults aged 18 to 70 years with prolonged grief disorder, as defined in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, and assessed by clinical interview based on the Prolonged Grief-13 (PG-13) scale. Those with severe suicidal risk, presence of psychosis, or substance dependence were excluded. Between November 2012 and November 2022, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to eleven 90-minute sessions of grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy at a traumatic stress clinic in Sydney, Australia, with follow-up through 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received once-weekly 90-minute individual sessions for 11 weeks. Grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy comprised 5 sessions of recalling memories of the deceased, plus cognitive restructuring and planning future social and positive activities. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy comprised mindfulness exercises adapted to tolerate grief-related distress. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in prolonged grief disorder severity measured by the PG-13 scale assessed at baseline, 1 week posttreatment, and 6 months after treatment (primary outcome time point), as well as secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, grief-related cognition, and quality of life. RESULTS: The trial included 100 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [13.4] years; 87 [87.0%] female), 50 in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy condition and 50 in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy condition. Linear mixed models indicated that at the 6-month assessment, participants in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy group showed greater reduction in PG-13 scale score relative to those in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group (mean difference, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.6-12.5; P = .01), with a large between-group effect size (0.8; 95% CI, 0.2-1.3). Participants in the grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy group also demonstrated greater reductions in depression as measured on the Beck Depression Inventory than those in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group (mean difference, 6.6; 95% CI, 0.5-12.9; P = .04) and grief-related cognition (mean difference, 14.4; 95% CI, 2.8-25.9; P = .02). There were no other significant differences between treatment groups and no reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy conferred more benefit for core prolonged grief disorder symptoms and associated problems 6 months after treatment than mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Although both treatments may be considered for prolonged grief disorder, grief-focused cognitive behavior therapy might be the more effective choice, taking all factors into consideration.

        "abstract": "Protecting the mental health of healthcare workers is an urgent global public health priority. Healthcare workers, especially those immersed in palliative care, are prone to burnout due to the intense emotions associated with end-of-life caregiving. This study examines the efficacy of a novel, multimodal, and group-based Mindful-Compassion Art-based Therapy (MCAT) that integrates reflective self-awareness with creative emotional expression for protecting healthcare workers' mental health. A dual-arm open-label waitlist randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 56 healthcare workers were recruited from the largest homecare hospice in Singapore and randomized to the immediate-treatment condition of a standardized 6-week, 18-hours MCAT intervention (n=29), or the waitlist-control condition (n=27). Self-administered outcome measures on burnout, resilience, emotional regulation, self-compassion, death attitudes, and quality of life were collected at baseline, post-intervention/second-baseline at 6weeks, and follow-up/post-intervention at 12weeks. Results from mixed model ANOVAs reveal that treatment group participants experienced significant reduction in mental exhaustion, as well as significant improvements in overall emotional regulation, nonreactivity to intrusive thoughts, approach acceptance of death, and afterlife belief as compared to waitlist-control immediately after MCAT completion. Effect sizes of these impacts ranged from medium to large (\u03b7 (2)=0.65 to 0.170). Results from one-way ANOVAs further reveal that the treatment gains of reduced mental exhaustion and increased emotional regulation were maintained among treatment group participants at 12-weeks follow-up compared to baseline, with new benefits identified. These include increased ability to observe and describe one's experiences, elevated overall self-compassion, greater mindful awareness, enhanced common humanity, and better quality of life. Effect sizes of these impacts were large (\u03b7 (2)=0.128 to 0.298). These findings reflect the robust effectiveness and positive residual effects of MCAT for reducing burnout, building resilience, nurturing compassion, fostering collegial support, and promoting mental wellness among healthcare workers. The clinical model and applicability of MCAT in larger and more diverse caregiving contexts, such as family dementia care, are discussed.

We evaluated whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for life (MBCT-L), could reduce stress in healthcare workers and target a range of secondary outcomes. Method: This is the first parallel randomised controlled trial of MBCT-L. Participants were NHS workers, who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either MBCT-L or wait-list. The primary outcome was self-reported stress at post-intervention. Secondary variables were well-being, depression, anxiety, and work-related outcomes. Mixed regressions were used. Mindfulness and self/other-compassion were explored as potential mechanisms of effects on stress and wellbeing. Results: We assigned 234 participants to MBCT-L (n = 115) or to wait-list (n = 119). 168 (72%) participants completed the primary outcome and of those who started the MBCT-L 73.40% (n = 69) attended the majority of the sessions. MBCT-L ameliorated stress compared with controls (B = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.63\u20123.56; d = -0.72; p < .0001). Effects were also found for well-being, depression and anxiety, but not for work-related outcomes. Mindfulness and self-compassion mediated effects on stress and wellbeing. Conclusions: MBCT-L could be an effective and acceptable part of a wider healthcare workers well-being and mental health strategy.",

Reduced paranoia in the general population following brief online mindfulness training has been previously reported. This study investigated the feasibility of a 40-day online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) (n = 12) in the individuals with high positive schizotypy characterized by high suspiciousness/paranoia and to estimate its effect on paranoia as compared with an active control condition using reflective journaling (n = 12). The outcome measures were self-reported trait and VR-induced state paranoia, completed at baseline, after 10 days and post-intervention. The feasibility criteria included retention, adherence, engagement, and acceptability. There was 100% retention, excellent adherence to content and engagement, with an average MBI session completion rate of 91%. Acceptability, indexed by a self-rated motivation to continue practice post-intervention, was also high. No MBI effect on trait paranoia was observed; however, the MBI group showed a reduction in the VR-induced state paranoia with a medium-to-large effect (d = 0.63).

Recent studies demonstrated the benefits of yoga in psychological disorders. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of the Integrated Yoga Module (IYM) to standard care with added yogic education on lifestyle modification (YELM) in patients with clinical depression. METHODS: A PROBE trial was conducted at a single tertiary care hospital in India. Adults aged 18 to 64 with clinical depression were randomized to either an IYM or an active control group using a computer-generated mixed block randomization sequence. Both groups received YELM in addition to standard care and the intervention group practiced IYM, for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the reduction in depression symptoms assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and secondary outcomes involved self-compassion, brief resilience, positive and negative experiences, and quality of life, evaluated at 8 weeks. RESULTS: The mean \u00b1 SD age of participants was 32.2 \u00b1 10.0 and 54.3% were females.

While mindfulness meditation may mitigate the effects of chronic stress, it is uncertain if adults with MCI have the capacity to learn mindfulness meditation. METHODS: 14 adults with MCI were randomized 2:1 to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a wait-list control group. We conducted qualitative interviews with those who completed MBSR. Transcribed interviews were: a) coded using an emergent themes inductive approach informed by grounded theory; b) rated 0-10, with higher scores reflecting greater perceived benefit from, and understanding of, mindfulness meditation. Ratings were correlated with daily home practice times and baseline level of cognitive function. RESULTS: Seven themes emerged from the interviews: positive perceptions of class; development of mindfulness skills, including meta-cognition; importance of the group experience; enhanced well-being; shift in MCI perspective; decreased stress reactivity and increased relaxation; improvement in interpersonal skills. Ratings of perceived benefit and understanding ranged from 2-10 (mean = 7) and of 0-9.5 (mean = 6), respectively. Many participants experienced substantial benefit/understanding, some had moderate, and a few had minimal benefit/understanding. Understanding the key concepts of mindfulness was highly positively correlated with \u226520 minutes/day of home practice (r = 0.90) but not with baseline cognitive function (r = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Most adults with MCI were able to learn mindfulness meditation and had improved MCI acceptance, self-efficacy, and social engagement. Cognitive reserve may be enhanced through a mindfulness meditation program even in patients with MCI.",

        "title": "Assessing feasibility and acceptability of yoga and group CBT for adolescents with depression: A pilot randomized clinical trial.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Given increasing rates of depression in adolescents, there is a clear need for innovative treatments. In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we assessed acceptability and feasibility of two group-based interventions: yoga and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The goal of this work is to prepare for a future fully powered randomized trial to test the hypothesis that yoga is not inferior to an established adolescent depression treatment, namely, group CBT. METHODS: We enrolled 42 adolescents with elevated depression symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week group-based intervention, yoga or CBT. We had a priori feasibility and acceptability targets, including for recruitment rate, retention rate, expectancy, credibility, program satisfaction, class attendance, engagement in home practice, and instructor/leader manual adherence. We assessed adverse events, and within-subject changes in outcomes (depression, anxiety, impairment, sleep disturbance) and possible mediators (mindfulness, self-compassion). RESULTS: Both interventions met most acceptability and feasibility targets. The only target not met related to low engagement in home practice. Participants within each study arm showed decreased depression symptoms over time and increased self-compassion. CONCLUSIONS: A yoga intervention appears to be acceptable and feasible to adolescents with depression. However, it may be challenging for this group to engage in unstructured home practice.",

        "abstract": "HIV-infected youth experience many stressors, including stress related to their illness, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Therefore, there is a significant need to identify potentially effective interventions to improve stress management, coping, and self-regulation. The object of the study was to assess the effect of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program compared to an active control group on psychological symptoms and HIV disease management in youth utilizing a randomized controlled trial. Seventy-two HIV-infected adolescents, ages 14-22 (mean age 18.71 years), were enrolled from two urban clinics and randomized to MBSR or an active control. Data were collected on mindfulness, stress, self-regulation, psychological symptoms, medication adherence, and cognitive flexibility at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up. CD4+ T lymphocyte and HIV viral load (HIV VL) counts were also pulled from medical records. HIV-infected youth in the MBSR group reported higher levels of mindfulness (P = .03), problem-solving coping (P = .03), and life satisfaction (P = .047), and lower aggression (P = .002) than those in the control group at the 3-month follow-up. At post-program, MBSR participants had higher cognitive accuracy when faced with negative emotion stimuli (P = .02). Also, those in the MBSR study arm were more likely to have or maintain reductions in HIV VL at 3-month follow-up than those in the control group (P = .04). In our sample, MBSR instruction proved beneficial for important psychological and HIV-disease outcomes, even when compared with an active control condition. Lower HIV VL levels suggest improved HIV disease control, possibly due to higher levels of HIV medication adherence, which is of great significance in both HIV treatment and prevention. Additional research is needed to explore further the role of MBSR for improving the psychological and physical health of HIV-positive youth.",

This study compares mindfulness-based eating awareness training (MB-EAT) versus MB-EAT plus implementation intention model for effectiveness on body mass index (BMI), weight self-efficacy, and physical activity in obese women with BMIs <= 25 (n = 52). METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, the participants were selected by the simple random sampling method and randomly divided into three groups. A 12-session MB-EAT of 150 min per session was performed for experimental group I. The experimental group II received MB-EAT alone for physical activity planning and MB-EAT plus implementation intention; also, both groups were compared to the control group. Data were measured by the scales, a questionnaire, and a checklist, and the P-values are based on the results of the generalized estimating equation (GEE) test. P < 0.001 were considered the significance level. RESULTS: The MB-EAT and MB-EAT + implementation intention effectiveness on the two experimental groups' BMI, weight self-efficacy, and physical activity was significantly different from the control group. In the integrated group versus the MB-EAT group, BMI, physical activity, and physical discomfort, were more effective than the weight self-efficacy subscales. Both intervention groups were effective on BMI, weight self-efficacy, and physical activity, but the integrated group's effectiveness was more. CONCLUSIONS: The MB-EAT effectiveness trial is theory-based, reducing weight and the psychological and behavioral consequences of overweight and obese adults. The MB-EAT + the Implementation intention model is to plan regular and daily exercise according to each individual's specific circumstances.

        "title": "Predictors and Effects of Usage of an Online Mindfulness Intervention for Distressed Cancer Patients: Usability Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One in three cancer patients experience high psychological distress. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing psychological distress in this patient group. However, these interventions lack availability and flexibility, which may compromise participation in the intervention for cancer patients experiencing late symptoms like fatigue or pain. Therefore, mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly offered via the internet. However, little is known about the usage of these online mindfulness-based interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to (1) predict uptake of and adherence to online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (eMBCT) using baseline patient characteristics (demographic, cancer-related, personality, and psychological variables) and (2) examine the relations between adherence and treatment outcomes in eMBCT for cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 125 cancer patients were assigned to eMBCT in a parent randomized controlled trial comparing MBCT and eMBCT with treatment as usual in distressed cancer patients. Various usage measures of eMBCT were automatically tracked within the online program. Based on activity of use, participants were classified as nonusers, minimal users, low users, and intended users. Questionnaires were used to assess baseline characteristics (preintervention) and outcomes (pre- and postintervention). To answer the research questions, data were analyzed with t tests, \u03c7(2) tests, and linear regression models. RESULTS: Based on weekly activity, participants were classified as nonusers (n=17, 13.6%), who completed no exercises in MBCT; minimal users (n=31, 24.8%), who completed at least one exercise of one to three sessions; low users (n=12, 9.6%), who completed at least one exercise of four to seven sessions; and intended users (n=65, 52.0%), who completed at least one exercise of eight to nine sessions. Nonusers had more fear of cancer recurrence at baseline than users (uptake), and intended users were more conscientious than minimal and low users (adherence). Intended users reported a larger reduction in psychological distress and more improvement of positive mental health (ie, emotional, psychological, and social well-being) after the intervention than other participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that adherence was related to improved patient outcomes. Patients with strong fear of recurrence or low levels of conscientiousness should receive extra attention, as they are less likely to respectively start or complete eMBCT. Future research may focus on the development of flexible and adaptive eMBCT programs to fit individual needs.",

OBJECTIVES: This study tested the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for reducing ART symptoms and bother/distress related to ART side effects. Secondary aims were to test the impact of MBSR on medication adherence and psychological functioning. METHODS: Seventy-six people living with HIV who were actively taking ART and reported distress from ART-related side effects were randomly assigned to an MBSR program or a wait-list control (WLC) standard care condition. We measured side effects, ART adherence, perceived stress, depression, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness at three time points: baseline, three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up. Side effects and related distress were assessed separately from other symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with a WLC, participants in the MBSR condition experienced a reduction in the frequency of symptoms attributable to ARTs at three months post-intervention (mean difference=0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.01, 0.66; t(132)=2.04, P=0.044) and six months post-intervention (mean difference=0.38; 95% CI=0.05, 0.71; t(132)=2.27, P=0.025). MBSR participants also experienced a reduction in distress associated with those symptoms at three months post-intervention (mean difference=0.47; 95% CI=0.003, 0.94; t(132)=1.99, P=0.048) compared with the WLC condition.

Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment. The objectives of the study were to assess the feasibility of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program (MBCT) for adults with MCS and to evaluate possible effects on psychological distress and illness perception. The study design was a randomized clinical trial. The MBCT programme comprised 8 weekly sessions of 21\u20442 hours. Forty-two adults were screened for eligibility and 37 were included. Mean age of the participants was 51.6 years, 35 (94.6%) were female and 21 (56.8%) were unemployed. Measures of psychological distress and illness perceptions were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and at 3 months follow-up. No significant differences in effect measures were found between the groups. However, those who completed the MBCT program generally reported benefiting in terms of improved coping strategies and sleep quality. The positive verbal feedback from the participants in the MBCT group suggests that a larger randomized clinical trial on the effect of MBCT for MCS could be considered.",

Positive outcomes of psychoeducation interventions have been found, but many of them are relatively long in duration, making them less cost-effective in implementation. The proposed study is a multi-site, three-arm randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness-based intervention for Chinese family caregivers. Effects of the intervention will be compared with those of an evidence-based psychoeducation program and treatment-as-usual. Two hundred forty cross-generational caregivers of frail older adults with moderate to severe levels of frailty will be recruited and randomly assigned to mindfulness-based intervention, psychoeducation, and treatment-as-usual experimental conditions. Program effectiveness will be analyzed on measures of caregiver burden, depression, anxiety, positive caregiving experience, spirituality, family conflict, and the biomarker of heart rate variability. Measures on coping styles, experiential avoidance, and self-efficacy will be explored to see if they mediate the changes to participant improvements in outcomes. Six-month follow-up will be included to investigate the maintenance effects. This study will provide evidence on mindfulness-based interventions on caregivers of frail older adults and expand the existing models of intergenerational caregiving in Chinese culture.",

Mindfulness-based intervention holds promise as an effective approach to promoting health and well-being. OBJECTIVES: To explore the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects on psychological distress, cardiovascular risk factors and health-related quality of life of a mindfulness-oriented psycho-behavioral intervention for patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability and potential effects of the intervention in 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The intervention included six weekly sessions, including one face-to-face session and five WeChat-delivered sessions that incorporated mindfulness training with health education and lifestyle modification. Eligible patients were recruited in two public hospitals in China and randomly allocated into the intervention group (n = 25) or control group (n = 25). RESULTS: Intervention feasibility was supported by a relatively high recruitment rate (66.7%) and retention rate (84%) and a smooth and brief data collection procedure (15 to 25 min) of the pilot study. Positive responses of the acceptability dichotomous scale ranged from 81% to 100%, suggesting the intervention was generally acceptable. The intervention had a significant group * time effect on dietary behavior (B = 0.31,95% CI: 0.08, 0.54, P = 0.008) with an effect size (Cohen's d) of -0.72. CONCLUSIONS: The mindfulness-oriented psycho-behavioral intervention appears to be feasible and acceptable and have a promising effect on dietary behavior in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

        "title": "Rationale and design of a multisite randomized clinical trial examining an integrated behavioral treatment for veterans with co-occurring chronic pain and opioid use disorder: The pain and opioids integrated treatment in veterans (POSITIVE) trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) individually represent a risk to health and well-being. Concerningly, there is evidence that they are frequently co-morbid. While few treatments exist that simultaneously target both conditions, preliminary work has supported the feasibility of an integrated behavioral treatment targeting pain interference and opioid misuse. This treatment combined Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (ACT+MBRP). This paper describes the protocol for the adequately powered efficacy study of this integrated treatment. METHODS: A multisite randomized controlled trial will examine the efficacy of ACT+MBRP in comparison to a parallel education control condition, focusing on opioid safety and pain education. Participants include veterans (n = 160; 21-75 years old) recruited from three Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare Systems with chronic pain who are on a stable dose of buprenorphine. Both conditions include twelve weekly 90 min group sessions delivered via telehealth. Primary outcomes include pain interference (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System - Pain Interference) and hazardous opioid use (Current Opioid Misuse Measure), which will be examined at the end of the active treatment phase and through 12 months post-intervention. Secondary analyses will evaluate outcomes including pain intensity, depression, pain-related fear, and substance use, as well as treatment mechanisms. CONCLUSION: This study will determine the efficacy of an integrated behavioral treatment program for pain interference and hazardous opioid use among veterans with chronic pain and OUD who are prescribed buprenorphine, addressing a critical need for more integrated treatments for chronic pain and OUD.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and therefore early intervention could have the best chance of preserving brain health. There are significant differences in health awareness, living customs, and daily behaviors among Chinese older adults compared to Europeans and Americans. Because the synergistic benefits of multidomain non-pharmacological interventions are consistent with the multifactorial pathogenicity of MCI, such interventions are more appealing, easier to adhere to, and more relevant to daily life than single-mode interventions. One of the aims of this study is to verify the effect of multidomain intervention strategies for MCI patients based on Chinese population characteristics, and the other is to establish a biobank and image database to investigate the pathogenesis and pathways of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Our study was designed as a national multicenter, community-based randomized controlled trial (RCT). Twelve medical institutions in ten Chinese cities will participate in our study from 2020 to 2024, and 1080 community residents aged 50 and above will be enrolled as participants. Each sub-center will be responsible for 90 participants (30 people per community) across three communities (non-contact control group, health education group, and multidomain intervention group). The community will be the basic unit of the present study, and all participants in each community will receive the same intervention/control measure. Three working groups are set up in each sub-center to manage the three communities independently to minimize interference at the implementation level between the groups. The multidomain intervention group will receive integrated interventions including exercise, nutrition, sleep, health education and mindfulness meditation. All data generated by the research will be analyzed and processed by statistical software (such as SPSS 21.0, Python 3.0, etc.), and part of the research data will be displayed in the form of graphs and tables. DISCUSSION: In order to achieve a high-quality community intervention study, it is crucial to have a well-designed experimental protocol that follows rigorous scientific methodology. In addition, effective management of quality control measures and monitoring compliance throughout the study process are essential components.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk for psychological and behavioral disturbances after cancer treatment. Targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group. METHODS: This randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief, mindfulness-based intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress, depression, and inflammatory activity. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6-week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPS) intervention group (n = 39) or to a wait-list control group (n = 32). Participants completed questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes) as well as physical symptoms, cancer-related distress, and positive outcomes. Blood samples were collected to examine genomic and circulating markers of inflammation. Participants also completed questionnaires at a 3-month follow-up assessment. RESULTS: In linear mixed models, the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress (P = .004) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms (P = .094), as well as significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression (P = .009) and inflammatory signaling (P = .001) at postintervention. Improvements in secondary outcomes included reduced fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and increased peace and meaning and positive affect (P < .05 for all). Intervention effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up assessment, although reductions in cancer-related distress were observed at that assessment.

Employing a randomized waitlist control study design, we sought to (a) assess an Internet-based instructor-led mindfulness intervention for its effect on key factors associated with \"recovery from work,\" specifically, work-related rumination, fatigue, and sleep quality; (b) assess different facets of mindfulness (acting with awareness, describing, nonjudging, and nonreacting) as mechanisms of change; and (c) assess whether the effect of the intervention was maintained over time by following up our participants after 3 and 6 months. Participants who completed the mindfulness intervention (n = 60) reported significantly lower levels of work-related rumination and fatigue, and significantly higher levels of sleep quality, when compared with waitlist control participants (n = 58). Effects of the intervention were maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up with medium to large effect sizes. The effect of the intervention was primarily explained by increased levels of only 1 facet of mindfulness (acting with awareness). This study provides support for online mindfulness interventions to aid recovery from work and furthers our understanding with regard to how mindfulness interventions exert their positive effects.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive problems, both complaints and objective impairments, are frequent and disabling in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and profoundly affect daily living. However, intervention studies that focus on cognitive problems that patients experience in their daily lives are limited. This study therefore aimed to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on patient-reported cognitive complaints in MS. METHODS: In this randomized-controlled trial, MS patients with cognitive complaints completed questionnaires and underwent neuropsychological assessments at baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Patient-reported cognitive complaints were primarily investigated. Secondary outcomes included personalized cognitive goals and objective cognitive function. CRT and MBCT were compared to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Patients were randomized into CRT (n = 37), MBCT (n = 36) or ETAU (n = 37), of whom 100 completed the study. Both CRT and MBCT positively affected patient-reported cognitive complaints compared to ETAU at post-treatment (p<.05), but not 6 months later. At 6-month follow-up, CRT had a positive effect on personalized cognitive goals (p=.028) and MBCT on processing speed (p=.027). Patients with less cognitive complaints at baseline benefited more from CRT on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (i.e. primary outcome measuring cognitive complaints) at post-treatment (p=.012-.040), and those with better processing speed at baseline benefited more from MBCT (p=.016). CONCLUSION: Both CRT and MBCT alleviated cognitive complaints in MS patients immediately after treatment completion, but these benefits did not persist. In the long term, CRT showed benefits on personalized cognitive goals and MBCT on processing speed. These results thereby provide insight in the specific contributions of available cognitive treatments for MS patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) suffer from psychological distress, fatigue and sleep disturbances, which are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased societal costs. Only limited psychosocial treatment options are available. As Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has demonstrated to improve psychological distress, QoL and sleep in other populations, MBCT might also be effective in patients with IBD. METHODS: The MindIBD study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing MBCT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) versus TAU alone in a targeted number of 136 IBD patients in remission, aged 16 years and older with at least mild psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score \u2265 11). Primary outcome is reduction of psychological distress post-intervention, measured by the HADS. In addition, the effect of MBCT on sleep quality (including actigraphy and electroencephalography recordings), fatigue, disease activity, perceived disease control, QoL and positive mental health will be examined. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up. Cost-effectiveness will be determined and a process evaluation will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This study will provide valuable insight into the clinical effect of MBCT on psychological distress, sleep quality, fatigue and QoL in IBD patients and into the cost-effectiveness.

        "title": "Short-Term Effects of a Multidimensional Stress Prevention Program on Quality of Life, Well-Being and Psychological Resources. A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "It is well-documented that university students have an increased risk in developing psychological problems because they face multiple stressors. Cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness-based stress prevention programs were shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress in university students. However, little is known of their effect on resource activation. Additionally, most validated interventions are unidimensional, i.e., including one stress-coping approach. In this study, we investigated the short-term effects of a multidimensional stress prevention program on students' quality of life, psychological symptoms and resources, and resilience factors against stress. Using an experimental design, 64 healthy undergraduate students (56 women), between 18 and 34 years old (M = 21.34, SD = 2.53), from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, were randomly allocated either to the intervention or the wait-list control group. The intervention group participated in a multidimensional stress prevention program, integrating mindfulness-based activities, cognitive and behavioral strategies, social skills, and emotional regulation exercises. The program consisted of eight 2-h weekly sessions. Before and after the intervention, participants completed self-reported questionnaires evaluating quality of life; psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and interpersonal problems; as well as psychological resources like self-efficacy, sense of coherence, self-compassion, and social support, presented online. A standardized clinical interview was performed at pre- and post-measurement times. To analyze the sort-term effects of the program, we used mixed, two-factorial ANOVAs (per-protocol analyses). In accordance with our hypotheses, our results showed significant reduction of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, interpersonal problems, and symptoms of pain; a significant increase in quality of life, sense of coherence, and self-compassion in students who participated in the intervention program compared to the control group, (all p < 0.05). No significant results were found for symptoms of depression, social anxiety, self-efficacy, and social support. These preliminary findings indicate specific short-term effects of our multidimensional stress prevention program on psychological symptoms and on quality of life as well as promising effects on psychological resources and factors associated with resilience against stress. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of the intervention as well as the effects in clinical samples.",

        "title": "The efficacy of a brief app-based mindfulness intervention on psychosocial outcomes in healthy adults: A pilot randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public. METHODS: The present pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app 'Headspace' (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen's d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self-reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that self-reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short-term engagement with a mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive studies.

        "title": "Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Training in Surgery: Additional Analysis of the Mindful Surgeon Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Mindfulness meditation training has been shown to be feasible in surgical trainees, but affective, cognitive, and performance benefits seen in other high-stress populations have yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To explore potential benefits to stress, cognition, and performance in postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1) surgery residents receiving modified mindfulness-based stress reduction (modMBSR). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This follow-up study is an analysis of the Mindful Surgeon pilot randomized clinical trial of modMBSR (n = 12) vs an active control (n = 9), evaluated at baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 1 year (T3), took place at an academic medical center residency training program among PGY-1 surgery residents. Data were collected between June 2016 and June 2017 and analyzed from June 2017 to December 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Weekly 2-hour modMBSR classes and 20 minutes of daily home practice during an 8-week period vs an active control (different content, same structure). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preliminary evidence of efficacy was explored, primarily focusing on perceived stress and executive function and secondarily on burnout, depression, motor skill performance, and changes in blood oxygen level-dependent functional neuroimaging during an emotion regulation task. Group mean scores were calculated at T1, T2, and T3 and in linear mixed-effects multivariate analysis. Effect size for analysis of covariance is presented as partial \u03b72 with the following cutoff points: small, less than 0.06; medium, 0.06 to 0.14; large, greater than 0.14. RESULTS: Postgraduate year 1 surgery residents (N = 21; 8 [38%] women) were randomized to a modMBSR arm (n = 12) or an active control arm (n = 9). Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed differences at T2 and T3 in perceived stress (mean [SD] difference at T2: modMBSR, 1.42 [5.74]; control, 3.44 [6.71]; \u03b72 = 0.07; mean [SD] difference at T3: modMBSR, 1.00 [4.18]; control, 1.33 [4.69]; \u03b72 = 0.09) and in mindfulness (mean [SD] difference at T2: modMBSR, 3.08 [3.63]; control, 1.56 [4.28]; \u03b72 = 0.13; mean [SD] difference at T3: modMBSR, 2.17 [3.66]; control, -0.11 [6.19]; \u03b72 = 0.15). Burnout at T2 (mean [SD] difference: modMBSR, 4.50 [9.08]; control, 3.44 [6.71]; \u03b72 = 0.01) and T3 (mean [SD] difference: modMBSR, 5.50 [9.96]; control, 5.56 [9.69]; \u03b72 = 0.01) showed similar increase in both groups. Working memory increased more at T2 in the modMBSR arm (mean [SD] difference, 0.35 [0.60]) than in the control arm (mean [SD] difference, 0.21 [0.74]; \u03b72 = 0.02) and at T3 (modMBSR, 0.68 [0.69]; control, 0.26 [0.58]; \u03b72 = 0.20). Cognitive control decreased more in the control arm at T2 (mean [SD] difference at T2: modMBSR, 0.15 [0.40]; control, -0.07 [0.32]; \u03b72 = 0.13) and at T3 (mean [SD] difference: modMBSR, 0.07 [0.59]; control, -0.26 [0.53]; \u03b72 = 0.16). Mean (SD) circle-cutting time improved more at T2 in the modMBSR arm (-24.08 [63.00] seconds) than in the control arm (-4.22 [112.94] seconds; \u03b72 = 0.23) and at T3 in the modMBSR arm (-4.83 [77.94] seconds) than in the control arm (11.67 [145.17] seconds; \u03b72 = 0.13). Blood oxygen level-dependent functional neuroimaging during an emotional regulation task showed unique postintervention activity in the modMBSR arm in areas associated with executive function control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and self-awareness (precuneus). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this pilot randomized clinical trial, modMBSR in PGY-1 surgery residents showed potential benefits to well-being and executive function, suggesting a powerful role for mindfulness-based cognitive training to support resident well-being and performance, as mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

        "title": "Understanding and restoring dopaminergic function in fibromyalgia patients using a mindfulness-based psychological intervention: a [18F]-DOPA PET study. Study protocol for the FIBRODOPA study-a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a very prevalent and debilitating chronic pain disorder that is difficult to treat. Mindfulness-based techniques are regarded as a very promising approach for the treatment of chronic pain and in particular FM. The Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention, a mindfulness-based group intervention, has shown beneficial effects in opioid-treated chronic pain patients, including reduced pain severity, functional interference, and opioid dosing, by restoring neurophysiological and behavioral responses to reward. The first evidence for a hypodopaminergic state and impaired reward processing in FM has been reported. However, little is known about its impact on dopamine (DA) function and in particular with regard to DA responses to monetary reward in FM. The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate if MORE is able to restore the DA function in FM patients, in particular with regard to the DA responses to reward, and to reduce pain and mood complaints in FM. METHODS: The present study is a multi-center interventional RCT with 3 time points: before the intervention, after completion of the intervention, and 3 months after completion of the intervention. Sixty-four FM patients will be randomly assigned to either the MORE intervention (N = 32) or a non-intervention control group (N = 32). Additionally, a comparison group of healthy women (N = 20) for PET measures will be enrolled and another group of healthy women (N = 15) will do the ambulatory assessments only. The MORE intervention consists of eight 2-h-long group sessions administered weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, FM participants will undergo [18F] DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MR imaging while performing a reward task. The primary outcome will be endogeneous DA changes measured with [18F] DOPA PET at baseline, after the intervention (after 8 weeks for the non-intervention control group), and at 3 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be (1) clinical pain measures and FM symptoms using standardized clinical scales; (2) functional brain changes; (3) measures of negative and positive affect, stress, and reward experience in daily life using the ambulatory assessment method (AA); and (4) biological measures of stress including cortisol and alpha-amylase. DISCUSSION: If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of MORE in restoring DA function, reducing pain, and improving mood symptoms, MORE can be judged to be a promising means to improve the quality of life in FM patients. The findings of this trial may inform health care providers about the potential use of the MORE intervention as a possible non-pharmacological intervention for FM.

        "title": "The coMforT study of a trauma-informed mindfulness intervention for women who have experienced domestic violence and abuse: a protocol for an intervention refinement and individually randomized parallel feasibility trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is common and destructive to health. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major mental health consequence of DVA. People who have experienced DVA have specific needs, arising from the repeated and complex nature of the trauma. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends more research on the effectiveness of psychological interventions for people who have experienced DVA. There is growing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions may help trauma symptoms. METHODS: Intervention refinement and randomized controlled feasibility trial. A prototype trauma-informed mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (TI-MBCT) intervention will be co-produced following qualitative interviews and consensus exercise with stakeholders. Participants in the feasibility trial will be recruited from DVA agencies in two geographical regions and randomized to receive either TI-MBCT or usual care (self-referral to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service). TI-MBCT will be delivered as a group-based eight-week program. It will not be possible to blind the participants or the assessors to the study allocation. The following factors will inform the feasibility of progressing to a fully powered trial: recruitment, retention, intervention fidelity, and the acceptability of the intervention and trial design to participants. We will also test the feasibility of measuring the following participant outcomes before and 6 months post-randomization: PTSD, dissociative symptoms, depression, anxiety, DVA re-victimization, self-compassion, and mother-reported child health. Process evaluation and economic analysis will be embedded within the feasibility trial. DISCUSSION: This study will lead to the development of a TI-MBCT intervention for DVA survivors with PTSD and inform the feasibility and design of a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). The full trial will aim to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a TI-MBCT intervention in improving the clinically important symptoms of PTSD in DVA survivors.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness is effective for reducing anxiety and depression and increasing chronic disease self-management. An accessible, insurance-reimbursable model for implementation in patient-centered medical homes within US healthcare systems has promise for patients with multi-morbid conditions. Clarifying both the dose needed to impact anxiety, depression and self-management, and the design requirements for accessible primary care implementation, is essential. METHODS: We tested feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC), an 8-week, referral-based, insurance-reimbursable mindfulness program integrated within primary care, compared with a Low-Dose Comparator (LDC), consisting of a 60-minute mindfulness introduction plus referral to community and digital resources. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks. MTPC is trauma-informed, incorporates mindfulness-oriented behavior change skills, and is designed to target anxiety, depression, stress, and chronic illness selfmanagement. Participants schedule a PCP visit to co-create a self-management action plan during week 6. RESULTS: Primary care providers (PCP) referred 344 patients over 14 months. Eighty-one participants with DSM-V anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, trauma- and stress-related disorders participated in this pilot randomized-controlled comparative effectiveness trial [MTPC (n=54); LDC (n=27)]. These data suggest that MTPC was more effective than LDC for reducing anxiety (p=0.01), enhancing mindfulness (p=0.02) and self-compassion (p=0.001), and for catalyzing selfmanagement behavior change through action plan initiation (OR=4.34, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: MTPC was successfully integrated into a health system, was billed to insurance, and was acceptable to a diverse primary care population. Replication with a larger study and further accessibility adaptations are needed to confirm and expand these pilot results.",

        "abstract": "The lack of highly effective treatments for fibromyalgia (FM) represents a great challenge for public health. The objective of this parallel, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was two-fold: (1) to analyze the clinical effects of mindfulness plus amygdala and insula retraining (MAIR) compared to a structurally equivalent active control group of relaxation therapy (RT) in the treatment of FM; and (2) to evaluate its impact on immune-inflammatory markers and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in serum. A total of 41 FM patients were randomized into two study arms: MAIR (intervention group) and RT (active control group), both as add-ons of treatment as usual. MAIR demonstrated significantly greater reductions in functional impairment, anxiety, and depression, as well as higher improvements in mindfulness, and self-compassion at post-treatment and follow-up, with moderate to large effect sizes. Significant decreases in pain catastrophizing and psychological inflexibility and improvements in clinical severity and health-related quality of life were found at follow-up, but not at post-treatment, showing large effect sizes. The number needed to treat was three based on the criteria of \u226550% Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) reduction post-treatment. Compared to RT, the MAIR showed significant decreases in BDNF. No effect of MAIR was observed in immune-inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and hs-CRP). In conclusion, these results suggest that MAIR, as an adjuvant of treatment-as-usual (TAU), appears to be effective for the management of FM symptoms and for reducing BDNF levels in serum.",

In addition, the potential mediating effects of mindful attention, self-compassion, and body awareness on the relationship between yoga and emotion regulation were examined. High school students were randomized to participate in a 16-week yoga intervention (n = 19) or regular PE (n = 18). Pre-post data analyses revealed that emotion regulation increased significantly in the yoga group as compared to the PE group (F (1,32) = 7.50, p = .01, and eta(2) = .19). No significant relationship was discovered between the changes in emotion regulation and the proposed mediating variables.

The present study tested the efficacy of an 8-week Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) meditation program compared to a 1-day control seminar on CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in stressed HIV infected adults. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with enrollment and follow-up occurring between November 2005 and December 2007. A diverse community sample of 48 HIV-1 infected adults was randomized and entered treatment in either an 8-week MBSR or a 1-day control stress reduction education seminar. The primary outcome was circulating counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Participants in the 1-day control seminar showed declines in CD4+ T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among participants in the 8-week MBSR program were unchanged from baseline to post-intervention (time x treatment condition interaction, p=.02). This effect was independent of antiretroviral (ARV) medication use. Additional analyses indicated that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness meditation training on buffering CD4+ T lymphocyte declines. These findings provide an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training can buffer CD4+ T lymphocyte declines in HIV-1 infected adults.

OBJECTIVES: This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of an adapted MBCT program for AYA, aged 16-29, with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-four AYAs were randomly allocated to MBCT (n = 33) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 31). Primary outcome measure was the depression score on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, stress, IBD-related quality of life, coping, mindfulness, post-traumatic growth, medication adherence, IBD activity, inflammatory markers, microbiome characteristics and brain functional connectivity. RESULTS: Study recruitment rate was 75%, retention rate 70%, and session attendance 92%. Intention to treat analyses revealed that, compared to TAU group, MBCT group had significantly lower depression (\u2206 = -6.0; 95%CI = -10.8 to -1.2; P = 0.015) and stress (\u2206 = -5.1; 95%CI = -10.1 to -0.0; P = 0.049), higher active coping (\u2206 = 1.0;95%CI = 0.1-1.9; P = 0.022), and total mindfulness scores (\u2206 = 10.9;95%CI = 1.1-20.8; P = 0.030) at 8 weeks (post-therapy), and improved coping by positive reframing (\u2206 = 1.1;95%CI = 0.0-2.2; P = 0.043) and planning (\u2206 = 0.9;95%CI = 0.0-1.9; P = 0.045), mindful awareness (\u2206 = 5.2.;95%CI = 2.0-8.5; P = 0.002) and total mindfulness scores (\u2206 = 10.8.;95%CI = 0.4-21.1; P = 0.042) at 20 weeks.

        "title": "The Effect of M-Health-Based Core Stability Exercise Combined with Self-Compassion Training for Patients with Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP) is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide, and the management of NCLBP has always been a problem. This study is designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of m-health-based core stability exercise (CSE) combined with self-compassion training (SCT) and compare it with m-health-based CSE alone for the management of NCLBP. METHODS: This study is a pilot, patient-blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants with NCLBP were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. All the participants received m-health-based CSE, but those in the intervention group also received SCT before CSE. The intervention took place weekly on Saturday or Sunday for 4 weeks in total. Patients self-assessed their outcomes by filling out electronic questionnaires at 4 and 16 weeks after the start of the study. The primary outcome metrics for these questionnaires were back pain disability (based on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ) and Pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS; current pain, worst pain, average pain). The secondary outcome metrics were anxiety (GAD-7,7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), Depression Symptoms (PHQ-9,Patient Health Questionnaire-9), pain catastrophizing (PCS, Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and Self-efficiency (PSEQ, Pain Self-Efficiency Questionnaire). RESULTS: A total of 37 patients comprising 28 (75.7%) females completed the study, with 19 patients in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. The mean (SD) patient age was 35.2 (11.1) years. For all primary outcomes, although there were no significant differences between groups, we found that participants in the intervention group improved function and pain earlier. The RMDQ score changed by - 1.771 points (95% CI - 3.768 to 0.227) from baseline to 4 weeks in the control group and by - 4.822 points (95% CI - 6.752 to - 2.892) in the intervention group (difference between groups, - 3.052 [95% CI - 5.836 to - 0.267]). Also, the RMDQ score changed by - 3.328 points (95% CI - 5.252 to - 1.403) from baseline to 16 weeks in the control group and by - 5.124 points (95% CI - 7.014 to - 3.233) in the intervention group (difference between groups - 1.796 [95% CI - 4.501 to 0.909]). A similar pattern was found in the NRS scores. For secondary outcomes, the intervention group was superior to the control group in for GAD-7 (intervention difference from CSE along at week 16, - 2.156 [95% CI - 4.434 to - 0.122; P value for group effect was 0.030]). At the end of treatment, the improvement in PCS in the intervention group was significant (difference in PCS score at week 4, - 6.718 [95% CI - 11.872 to - 1.564]). We also found significant changes in PCS in the control group (- 6.326 [95% CI, - 11.250 to - 1.401]) at the 16-week follow-up. As for PSEQ, there were no apparent differences between the two groups. There were no adverse events relented to study participation. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study is feasible to deliver, and our results indicate that participants in the group of m-health-based CSE combined with SCT may experience faster relief from pain intensity and back disability than those in the group of m-health-based CSE alone.

        "title": "Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (PREVENT): a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with a history of recurrent depression have a high risk of repeated depressive relapse or recurrence. Maintenance antidepressants for at least 2 years is the current recommended treatment, but many individuals are interested in alternatives to medication. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to reduce risk of relapse or recurrence compared with usual care, but has not yet been compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in a definitive trial. We aimed to see whether MBCT with support to taper or discontinue antidepressant treatment (MBCT-TS) was superior to maintenance antidepressants for prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence over 24 months. METHODS: In this single-blind, parallel, group randomised controlled trial (PREVENT), we recruited adult patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes and on a therapeutic dose of maintenance antidepressants, from primary care general practices in urban and rural settings in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned to either MBCT-TS or maintenance antidepressants (in a 1:1 ratio) with a computer-generated random number sequence with stratification by centre and symptomatic status. Participants were aware of treatment allocation and research assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was time to relapse or recurrence of depression, with patients followed up at five separate intervals during the 24-month study period. The primary analysis was based on the principle of intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN26666654. FINDINGS: Between March 23, 2010, and Oct 21, 2011, we assessed 2188 participants for eligibility and recruited 424 patients from 95 general practices. 212 patients were randomly assigned to MBCT-TS and 212 to maintenance antidepressants. The time to relapse or recurrence of depression did not differ between MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants over 24 months (hazard ratio 0\u00b789, 95% CI 0\u00b767-1\u00b718; p=0\u00b743), nor did the number of serious adverse events. Five adverse events were reported, including two deaths, in each of the MBCT-TS and maintenance antidepressants groups. No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals at risk for depressive relapse or recurrence. Both treatments were associated with enduring positive outcomes in terms of relapse or recurrence, residual depressive symptoms, and quality of life.

        "title": "Distant delivery of a mindfulness-based intervention for people with Parkinson's disease: the study protocol of a randomised pilot trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological difficulties, especially depression and anxiety, are the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Pharmacological treatments for these conditions appear relatively ineffective in Parkinson's disease. Mindfulness courses are increasingly popular and recognised as effective for managing emotional states, and there is growing evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness courses for people with long-term medical conditions. With this exploratory pilot trial, we want to assess the feasibility of the procedures and processes, including recruitment, most appropriate outcome measure(s), acceptability of type and number of measures, potential nocebo effects, and potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a specially adapted distance-delivered mindfulness-based intervention in people affected by Parkinson's disease. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a pilot two-arm randomised parallel group controlled trial. Sixty participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention group or a wait-list control group. The mindfulness intervention will include 1-h weekly sessions delivered by a health psychologist trained to facilitate mindfulness courses. Participants in both groups will complete standardised questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue, and daily activities at four time points (baseline, 4, 8, and 20 weeks). The analysis will also consider potential mechanisms of change, such as acceptance, self-compassion, and tolerance of uncertainty, as well as health economic outcomes. Participants' experiences of the mindfulness interventions will be explored via in-depth interviews. DISCUSSION: A mindfulness-based intervention for people with Parkinson's delivered remotely, through Skype group videoconferences, may represent a viable, more accessible, intervention for people with mobility limitations and people who live in rural areas. The trial will provide important information about the feasibility, potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of the intervention as well as mechanisms of psychosocial adjustment. The results of this pilot trial will help us design a phase III trial to assess efficacy of an online mindfulness-based intervention in Parkinson's disease and evaluate significance.

METHOD: A total of 130 participants were randomized to one of three intervention groups investigating varied program delivery methods. Primary outcomes assessed: depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, self-compassion, alcohol use, and life satisfaction. ACT processes assessed: acceptance, cognitive fusion, education values, valued living, and mindfulness. RESULTS: Improvement on the primary outcomes and ACT processes did not differ among the three intervention groups. Analyses showed significant improvements on all primary outcomes (except alcohol use), and on all ACT processes. All ACT processes mediated changes on one or more primary outcomes in the intent-to-treat sample. Intervention effects were consistent on most primary outcomes and ACT processes across three sample groupings. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings provide support for a web-based ACT mental health promotion program for university students.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness training has been shown to improve psychological health and general well-being. However, it is unclear which brain and personality systems may be affected by this practice for improving adaptive behavior and quality of life. The present study explores the effects of a 5-week mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) at the neuroanatomical level and its relationship with dispositional mindfulness and impulsivity. Sixty-six risky drivers were quasi-randomly assigned to a mindfulness training group (MT) or a control group (N). Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the UPPS-P impulsivity scale twice, at baseline and after receiving the MBI. We observed that MBI changes dispositional mindfulness in the non-reactivity and observing facets. Further, we observed that the magnitude of change in impulsivity was associated with the change in dispositional mindfulness. Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed that the volume of the right caudate nucleus of the MT group (n = 27) showed a reduction compared to that of the control group (n = 33), which increased in terms of the pre-post measurement (MT=-1.76 mm(3); N = 6.31 mm(3)). We also observed that reduced caudate nucleus volume correlated with decreased positive urgency in the MT group. Taken together, our results show that MBI improves the skills of observing and non-reactivity to inner experience, while producing changes in the structure of the caudate nucleus. These structural changes are associated with a reduction in impulsivity levels, decreasing the tendency to act rashly in situations that generate positive emotions and thus facilitating more adaptive behavior.",

The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of a blended-care mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and functional brain changes. Furthermore, correlations between changes in cognitive functioning and self-reported behavioral factors were investigated. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors (n = 33) who reported cognitive impairment were randomly allocated to a mindfulness condition (n = 18) or a waitlist control condition (n = 15). Patients completed questionnaires on cognitive impairment, emotional distress, and fatigue; neuropsychological tests; and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before the start of MBI (time 1 [T1]), immediately after the completion of an 8-week MBI program (T2), and 3 months postintervention (T3). Resting-state functional connectivity was estimated in the default mode network, the dorsal and salience attention networks, and the frontoparietal network. Mixed model repeated-measures analysis was performed to test the intervention effect. RESULTS: Patients in the mindfulness condition exhibited significantly higher connectivity between the dorsal and salience attention networks after the mindfulness intervention compared with those in the control condition. MBI participants also had reduced subjective cognitive impairment, emotional distress, and fatigue. No intervention effect was observed on neurocognitive tests. CONCLUSIONS: MBI may induce functional brain changes in networks related to attention and may have a positive effect on subjective measures of cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, MBI could be a suitable intervention to improve quality of life in this population and deserves further study in this context.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an integrated childbirth education intervention on reducing childbirth fear, anxiety, and depression, and improving dispositional mindfulness. DESIGN: A two-arm parallel, single-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women \u2265 20 years of age with a singleton pregnancy (12-24 weeks gestation) and their support partners were recruited. All women included in the study had a score of \u2265 7 points on a fear of childbirth visual analogue scale. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group (n = 53) received an 8-week course in a childbirth education programme, which included (1) childbirth education using simulation-based learning that highlighted coping with labour pain and (2) instruction in mindfulness breathing, body scans, stretching, sitting meditation, and mindfulness walking. Support partners were invited to participate. The control group (n = 53) received the usual standard prenatal care. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome of fear of childbirth was assessed using the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes of anxiety, depression, and dispositional mindfulness were assessed with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale, and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, respectively. Repeated data were collected at baseline, 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. FINDINGS: Ninety-one mothers completed the study, with a mean age of 33.9 years (SD = 4.4), and most were primipara (n = 83). The baseline measurements did not differ between the groups. Compared with the control group, there were significant differences in all measures from baseline for the intervention group: the scores were significantly lower for fear of childbirth (mean difference (MD) =-14.8 \u223c -23.7, p < .01), symptoms of anxiety (MD =-7.4 \u223c -6.4, p < .01), and depression (MD =-3.7 \u223c -3.5, p < .01); the levels of dispositional mindfulness were significantly higher (MD =4.9 \u223c 5.7, p < .01) at 36 weeks gestation, and 1 week postpartum. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The 8-week integrated childbirth education intervention was effective in reducing the fear of childbirth in pregnant women. The mindfulness techniques were easily learnt and applied by the participants. Using these techniques during pregnancy and labour enhanced participants' mental health and coping. The integrated childbirth education which includes pregnant women and their support partners could be easily taught by midwives in other contexts.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: One in five children have a learning and attentional disability (LAD). Parents of children with LAD are vulnerable to distress, but an evidence-based treatment has not been developed. METHODS: From June 2016 to November 2017, we conducted a mixed methods study to adapt and assess the virtual delivery of a mind-body group resiliency program, the Stress Management and Resiliency Training-Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP), to meet the needs of parents of children with LAD; this is an 8-session weekly group intervention. In the first phase, we conducted 4 parent focus group interviews, 2 professional focus group interviews, and 5 professional individual interviews, and 1 pilot group to adapt the SMART-3RP to target the needs of parents of children with LAD. In the second phase, we conducted a pilot wait-list controlled study to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a videoconferencing delivery of the adapted program. Parents were randomized to an immediate intervention group (IG) or wait-list control group (WC). Surveys were administered at baseline (time 1), end of intervention for the IG or 3 months post-baseline for the WC (time 2), and 3 months post treatment for the IG or end of intervention for the WC (time 3). RESULTS: Qualitative findings illustrated high levels of parental stress, with primary stressors including navigating the educational system, interactions with other parents, familial concerns, and financial and professional sacrifices. We adapted the manual to target these stressors and modified session logistics and delivery. Fifty-three parents (mean age = 46.8; 90.6% female) participated nationally in the pilot trial. 62.5% of participants completed \u2265 6/8 sessions; 81.8% reported continued daily/weekly relaxation response exercise practice. T1-T2 comparisons found that IG versus WC participants showed significant improvements in distress [VAS], \u2206M = - 1.95; d = .83 and resilience [CES], \u2206M = 6.38; d = .83, as well as stress coping [MOCS-A] \u2206M = 8.69; d = 1.39; depression and anxiety [PHQ-4], \u2206M = - 1.79; d = .71; social support [MOS-SSS], \u2206M = 5.47; d = .71; and empathy [IRI], \u2206M = 3.17; d = .77; improvements were sustained at the 3 month post intervention follow-up. CONCLUSION: Pilot wait-list randomized trial findings showed promising feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy for the SMART-3RP intervention adapted for parents of children with LAD. This virtually-delivered resiliency intervention improved parents' distress, resiliency, and stress coping, which were sustained. CLINICAL TRIALS ID: NCT02772432.",

        "abstract": "The impact of childhood experiences on the development of psychopathology is well established in the literature. Few studies, however, have assessed parental bonding during childhood as a predictor of response to anxiety disorders treatment. The aim of the study was to examine whether emotional memories of childhood parenting could predict short-term and long-term outcome in three different interventions for patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): mindfulness-based intervention (Body in Mind Training [BMT]), fluoxetine (FLX), and an active control group (quality of life [QoL]). A total of 124 participants from a randomized controlled trial for GAD treatment were evaluated pre- and post-treatment and after 18 months. Patients were assessed for the severity of GAD symptoms (GAD-7, PSWQ, and DERS), early memories of warmth and safeness (EMWSS), and recall of perceived threat and subordination/submission in childhood (ELES). Negative childhood memories predicted a greater reduction in anxiety symptoms on BMT treatment compared to FLX and QoL, whereas positive childhood memories predicted more symptomatic improvement in the QoL group. Our findings suggest that individuals with GAD who have early memories of subordination and threat appear to benefit more from interventions that focus on developing emotion-regulation strategies and enhancing self-compassion, such as mindfulness-based interventions.",

Eighty-five young adults visited the laboratory and were randomly assigned to three groups: a calm music group (CMG: n = 28), a happy music group (HMG: n = 30), and a sad music group (SMG: n = 27). Negative emotions were induced in all participants using a COVID-19 video, followed by the music intervention condition. Participants underwent the face-word Stroop tasks during which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The N2, N3, P3, and late positive component (LPC) were investigated. The results showed that calm music and happy music effectively regulate young adults' induced negative emotions, while young adults experienced more negative emotions when listening to sad music; the negative mood states at the post-induction phase inhibited the reaction of conflict control in face-word Stroop tasks, which manifested as lower accuracy (ACC) and slower reaction times (RTs). ERP results showed negative mood states elicited greater N2, N3, and LPC amplitudes and smaller P3 amplitudes. Further studies are needed to develop intervention strategies to enhance emotion regulation related to COVID-19 for other groups.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 20-40% of outpatients with diabetes experience elevated levels of emotional distress, varying from disease-specific distress to general symptoms of anxiety and depression. The patient's emotional well-being is related to other unfavorable outcomes, like reduced quality of life, sub-optimal self-care, impaired glycemic control, higher risk of complications, and increased mortality rates. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a new diabetes-specific, mindfulness-based psychological intervention. First, with regard to reducing emotional distress; second, with respect to improving quality of life, dispositional mindfulness, and self-esteem of patients with diabetes; third, with regard to self-care and clinical outcomes; finally, a potential effect modification by clinical and personality characteristics will be explored. METHODS/DESIGN: The Diabetes and Mindfulness study (DiaMind) is a randomized controlled trial. Patients with diabetes with low levels of emotional well-being will be recruited from outpatient diabetes clinics. Eligible patients will be randomized to an intervention group or a wait-list control group. The intervention group will receive the mindfulness program immediately, while the control group will receive the program eight months later. The primary outcome is emotional distress (anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms), for which data will be collected at baseline, four weeks, post intervention, and after six months follow-up. In addition, self-report data will be collected on quality of life, dispositional mindfulness, self-esteem, self-care, and personality, while complications and glycemic control will be assessed from medical files and blood pressure will be measured. Group differences will be analyzed with repeated measures analysis of covariance.The study is supported by grants from the Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation and Tilburg University and has been approved by a medical ethics committee. DISCUSSION: It is hypothesized that emotional well-being, quality of life, dispositional mindfulness, self-esteem, self-care, and blood pressure will improve significantly more in the mindfulness group compared to the control group. Results of this study can contribute to a better care for patients with diabetes with lowered levels of emotional well-being. It is expected that the first results will become available in 2012.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Subjectively experienced cognitive decline in older adults is an indicator of increased risk for dementia and is also associated with increased levels of anxiety symptoms. As anxiety is itself emerging as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, the primary question of the present study is whether an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention can significantly reduce anxiety symptoms in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The secondary questions pertain to whether such changes extend to other domains of psychological, social, and biological functioning (including cognition, self-regulation, lifestyle, well-being and quality of life, sleep, and selected blood-based biomarkers) associated with mental health, older age, and risk for dementia. METHODS: SCD-Well is a multicenter, observer-blinded, randomized, controlled, superiority trial, which is part of the Horizon 2020 European Union-funded \"Medit-Ageing\" project. SCD-Well compares an 8-week mindfulness- and compassion-based intervention specifically adapted for older adults with SCD with a validated 8-week health education program. Participants were recruited from memory clinics in four European sites (Cologne, Germany; London, United Kingdom; Barcelona, Spain; and Lyon, France) and randomized with a 1:1 allocation, stratified by site. RESULTS: The primary outcome, change in anxiety symptoms, and secondary outcomes reflecting psychological, cognitive, social, and biological functioning are assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 4 months after the end of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will provide evidence on whether a mindfulness-based intervention can effect changes in anxiety and other risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia in older adults with SCD and will inform the establishment of intervention strategies targeted at improving mental health in older adults.",

Yoga has been used to treat PTSD in other populations and may improve health outcomes for stillbirth mothers. The purpose of this study was to determine: (a) feasibility of a 12-week home-based, online yoga intervention with varying doses; (b) acceptability of a \"stretch and tone\" control group; and (c) preliminary efficacy of the intervention on reducing symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, perinatal grief, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindfulness, sleep quality, and subjective health. METHODS: Participants (N = 90) were recruited nationally and randomized into one of three groups for yoga or exercise (low dose (LD), 60 min per week; moderate dose (MD), 150 min per week; and stretch-and-tone control group (STC)). Baseline and post-intervention surveys measured main outcomes (listed above). Frequency analyses were used to determine feasibility. Repeated measures ANCOVA were used to determine preliminary efficacy. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine a dose-response relationship between minutes of yoga and each outcome variable. RESULTS: Over half of participants completed the intervention (n = 48/90). Benchmarks (\u226570% reported > 75% satisfaction) were met in each group for satisfaction and enjoyment. Participants meeting benchmarks (completing > 90% of prescribed minutes 9/12 weeks) for LD and MD groups were 44% (n = 8/18) and 6% (n = 1/16), respectively. LD and MD groups averaged 44.0 and 77.3 min per week of yoga, respectively. The MD group reported that 150 prescribed minutes per week of yoga was too much. There were significant decreases in PTSD and depression, and improvements in self-rated health at post-intervention for both intervention groups. There was a significant difference in depression scores (p = .036) and grief intensity (p = .009) between the MD and STC groups. PTSD showed non-significant decreases of 43% and 56% at post-intervention in LD and MD groups, respectively (22% decrease in control).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the need to incorporate seniors from various settings into mindfulness-based empirical research, issues of geriatric frailties and non-compliance remain. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a mindfulness-based elder care (MBEC) program on mental health and spiritual well-being among seniors with disabilities in long-term care residential settings. METHODS: This single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) randomly assigned seventy-seven participants into an MBEC group or control group of an eight-week MBEC program. Participants were assessed every four weeks at baseline (T(0)), mid-intervention (T(1)), post-intervention (T(2)) and follow-up (T(3)) using the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS-SF), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), respectively. RESULTS: Linear mixed model (LMM) showed that MBEC participants' mental health improved significantly after completing the intervention; compared with controls, the MBEC group exhibited significantly lower anxiety (state-anxiety at T(2); trait-anxiety at T(2) and T(3)) and fewer depressive symptoms. Spiritual well-being was also significantly enhanced compared to that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: MBEC has positive effects on both mental health and spiritual well-being outcomes among seniors with disabilities. In long-term care facilities, seniors with abilities have the potential to adhere to and engage in activities of a mindfulness-based intervention. This low risk, easily accessible, and effective 8-week program is recommended to be integrated into regular long-term care institutional routines.

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sleep disturbances are most prevalent among older adults and often go untreated. Treatment options for sleep disturbances remain limited, and there is a need for community-accessible programs that can improve sleep. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a mind-body medicine intervention, called mindfulness meditation, to promote sleep quality in older adults with moderate sleep disturbances. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel groups conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2012, at a medical research center among an older adult sample (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [7.4] years) with moderate sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] >5). INTERVENTIONS: A standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) intervention (n = 24) or a sleep hygiene education (SHE) intervention (n = 25) was randomized to participants, who received a 6-week intervention (2 hours per week) with assigned homework. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study was powered to detect between-group differences in moderate sleep disturbance measured via the PSQI at postintervention. Secondary outcomes pertained to sleep-related daytime impairment and included validated measures of insomnia symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue, as well as inflammatory signaling via nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. RESULTS: Using an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to those in the SHE group on the PSQI. With the MAPs intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.7) at baseline and 7.4 (1.9) at postintervention. With the SHE intervention, the mean (SD) PSQIs were 10.2 (1.8) at baseline and 9.1 (2.0) at postintervention. The between-group mean difference was 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6-2.9), with an effect size of 0.89. The MAPs group showed significant improvement relative to the SHE group on secondary health outcomes of insomnia symptoms, depression symptoms, fatigue interference, and fatigue severity (P < .05 for all). Between-group differences were not observed for anxiety, stress, or NF-\u03baB, although NF-\u03baB concentrations significantly declined over time in both groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of a community-accessible MAPs intervention resulted in improvements in sleep quality at immediate postintervention, which was superior to a highly structured SHE intervention. Formalized mindfulness-based interventions have clinical importance by possibly serving to remediate sleep problems among older adults in the short term, and this effect appears to carry over into reducing sleep-related daytime impairment that has implications for quality of life.

METHOD: In the context of a randomized clinical trial targeting suicide risk in Veterans, computerized Stroop and emotion Stroop (E-Stroop) tasks were administered 3 times over 6-months follow-up to 135 high suicide risk Veterans. Seventy were randomized to receive MBCT-S in addition to enhanced treatment as usual (eTAU), and 65 were randomized to eTAU only. E-Stroop word types included positively- and negatively-valenced emotion, suicide, and combat-related words. Interference scores and mixed effects linear regression analyses were used. RESULTS: Veterans receiving MBCT-S showed a more favorable trajectory of attentional control over time, as indicated by performance on two E-Stroop tasks. Combat-stress interference scores improved over time among Veterans in MBCT-S. Interference processing time for negative affective words deteriorated over time among Veterans receiving eTAU only. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT-S may effectively target attentional control, and in particular reduce processing time during affective interference, in high suicide risk Veterans.

The secondary outcomes were anxiety (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Self-rating Depression Scale), and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (The Chinese version of Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire). The participants were assessed at baseline (T0) and week 8 (T1). The data were statistically analyzed by SPSS 21.0. The participants in the MBSR group experienced significantly better outcomes in their quality of life, psychological distress, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies than the control group. The MBSR intervention was demonstrated to improve the positive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and quality of life in patients with breast cancer under early chemotherapy and significantly reduce the patient's anxiety, depression, and negative cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and help the patients to adjust their mental state and promote positive psychology to improve their quality of life.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research suggests the use of different forms of therapy as a way of decreasing dropout rates in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The psychotherapies to be assessed in this study are trial-based cognitive therapy (TBCT), mindfulness-based health promotion (MBHP) and positive psychotherapy (PPT). OBJECTIVES: (1) to assess the online efficacy of TBCT compared to MBHP and PPT to reduce the symptoms of PTSD in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; (2) to compare the efficacy of these psychotherapies in improving anxiety, depression, guilt and in promoting well-being; and (3) to describe how professionals perceive online treatment. METHODS: A randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical trial will be conducted, with three separate arms. An estimated sample of 135 patients will receive either TBCT, MBHP or PPT and will be treated through online, individual, weekly visits, totaling 14 sessions. The primary outcome will be CAPS-5 and secondary outcomes will be HADS and WHO-5. The variables used to mediate these outcomes will be the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI), Negative Core Beliefs Inventory (NCBI) and the California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS-P). EXPECTED RESULTS: PTSD symptoms are expected to be reduced after TBCT, MBHP and PPT. No statistical difference is expected to be found among the three. DISCUSSION: The present study will evaluate and contribute towards the development of new psychotherapeutic options for patients with PTSD. The results of this study will allow the dissemination of new effective and adaptable interventions for patients with PTSD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are known for their beneficial effects on positive and negative psychological factors. When applied in an occupational context, MBIs might help workers to cope with stress, increase their professional outcomes and wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: In this two-groups pre-post experimental design we tested the effect of our MBI, called Integral Meditation (IM), among the employers of an Italian service company by measuring positive and negative aspects of psychological wellbeing related to mindfulness and workplace functioning through eight self-report questionnaires (CORE-OM, FFMQ, WEMWBS, MAIA, PSS, PANAS, STAI-X1, SCS). METHOD: Forty-two voluntary non-clinical employers of the company, randomly assigned to the experimental or the control group, were analyzed. The experimental group underwent our IM program, which consists of 12 weekly meditation classes given after the afternoon shift, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data was analyzed via linear mixed models. RESULTS: Statistically significant results were obtained for FFMQ observing subscale (beta= 0.49, p = 0.014), WEMWBS (beta= 5.31, p = 0.02), PSS (beta= -3.31, p = 0.03), the whole scale of SCS (beta= 0.47, p = 0.01) and self-judgment (beta= 0.68, p = 0.003) and isolation (beta= -0.66, p = 0.01) SCS subscales. Statistically significant results were also found in four out of eight subscales of MAIA: emotional awareness (beta= 1.26, p < 0.001), self-regulation (beta= 1.28, p < 0.001), body listening (beta= 1.08, p < 0.001) and trusting (beta= 1.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our intervention has demonstrated to bring beneficial effects in a mindfulness subdomain, in perceived stress, self-compassion, interoception and psychological wellbeing. Based on our results, we conclude that our intervention was effective in increasing the positive aspects of wellbeing and in reducing stress.",

In the current study, we tested the efficacy of an online version of a compassion-focused intervention, mindfulness-based compassionate living (MBCL), with guidance on request. A total of 122 self-referred participants with increased levels of self-criticism were randomly assigned to care as usual (CAU) or the intervention group (CAU + online intervention). Primary endpoints were self-reported depressive, anxiety and distress symptoms (DASS-21) and self-compassion (SCS) at 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints were self-criticism, mindfulness, satisfaction with life, fear of self-compassion, self-esteem, and existential shame. At posttreatment, the intervention group showed significant changes with medium to large effect sizes compared to the control group regarding primary outcomes (Cohen's d: 0.79 [DASS] and -1.21 [SCS]) and secondary outcomes (Cohen's ds: between 0.40 and 0.94 in favor of the intervention group). The effects in the intervention group were maintained at 6-months postrandomization. Adherence measures (number of completed modules, self-reported number of completed exercises per week) predicted postintervention scores for self-compassion but not for depressive, anxiety, and distress symptoms in the intervention group. The current study shows the efficacy of an online intervention with a transdiagnostic intervention target on a broad range of measures, including depressive and anxiety symptoms and self-compassion.",

        "abstract": "Compassion meditation (CM) is a promising intervention for enhancing compassion, although its active ingredients and neurobiological mechanisms are not well-understood. To investigate these, we conducted a three-armed placebo-controlled randomized trial (N = 57) with longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared a 4-week CM program delivered by smartphone application with (i) a placebo condition, presented to participants as the compassion-enhancing hormone oxytocin, and (ii) a condition designed to control for increased familiarity with suffering others, an element of CM which may promote compassion. At pre- and post-intervention, participants listened to compassion-eliciting narratives describing suffering others during fMRI. CM increased brain responses to suffering others in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) relative to the familiarity condition, p < 0.05 family-wise error rate corrected. Among CM participants, individual differences in increased mOFC responses positively correlated with increased compassion-related feelings and attributions, r = 0.50, p = 0.04. Relative to placebo, the CM group exhibited a similar increase in mOFC activity at an uncorrected threshold of P < 0.001 and 10 contiguous voxels. We conclude that the mOFC, a region closely related to affiliative affect and motivation, is an important brain mechanism of CM. Effects of CM on mOFC function are not explained by familiarity effects and are partly explained by placebo effects.",

        "abstract": "Although research has suggested that body image improves following self-compassion meditation training, studies have been limited due to the use of a wait-list control group. This study therefore compared the effects of self-compassion meditations to an active control group. Seventy young adult women (17-35 years) were randomly assigned to receive either self-compassion or nature-focused guided imagery meditations. Over one week, participants engaged in two meditations and completed pre- and post-test measures of trait self-compassion, body appreciation, body shame, and appearance-contingent self-worth. A mixed design analysis of variance revealed a main effect of time; women in both meditation groups demonstrated significant increases in self-compassion and body appreciation, and significant reductions in body shame. No effect was found for appearance-contingent self-worth. There were no interactions or main effects for group. Self-compassion may improve body image in women, although there was no evidence for an advantage of self-compassion over guided imagery meditations. Common elements between self-compassion and guided imagery may be a mechanism for improving body image. However, further research is warranted to isolate the effects of these meditations from other specific and non-specific treatment effects.

Forty-seven women enrolled between 10 and 25 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to either a series of weekly Mindful Awareness Practices classes (n = 24) with home practice or to a reading control condition (n = 23). Hierarchical linear models of between-group differences in change over time demonstrated that participants in the mindfulness intervention experienced larger decreases from pre-to post-intervention in pregnancy-specific anxiety and pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) than participants in the reading control condition. However, these effects were not sustained through follow-up at six weeks post-intervention. Participants in both groups experienced increased mindfulness, as well as decreased perceived stress and state anxiety over the course of the intervention and follow-up periods. This study is one of the first randomised controlled pilot trials of a mindfulness meditation intervention during pregnancy and provides some evidence that mindfulness training during pregnancy may effectively reduce PRA and worry. We discuss some of the dilemmas in pursuing this translational strategy and offer suggestions for researchers interested in conducting mind-body interventions during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) report greater emotion dysregulation, which is associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Given the transdiagnostic significance of emotion dysregulation, the current study was designed to assess the feasibility and treatment effects of mindfulness meditation in reducing emotion dysregulation for PwMS. METHOD: Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 4-week mindfulness-based training (MBT), 4-week adaptive cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist control group. Using self-report and behavioral measures, we examined the effects of MBT on emotion dysregulation, use of emotion regulation strategies, experience of negative and positive affect, and overall quality of life. RESULTS: Mindfulness training was associated with reduced emotion dysregulation compared with the adaptive cognitive training and the waitlist control group (\u03b7(p)2 = .20). Relative to the waitlist group, the MBT group also demonstrated reductions on a composite score of preservative cognition, measuring rumination and worry (\u03b7(p)2 = .15). However, there was no differential use of emotion regulation strategies or between-groups differences in overall quality of life as a function of training. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study provides preliminary support for MBT to reduce self-reported emotion dysregulation in PwMS. Given the widespread prevalence of mental health disturbances in this population, MBT can serve as a promising rehabilitation tool for PwMS (clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02717429).

DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial of Whitu against waitlist control, with 45 participants in each arm. PARTICIPANTS: 90 New Zealand young people aged 16-30 recruited via a social media advertising campaign. SETTING: Participants' homes. INTERVENTIONS: Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and refined from a prototype version that was evaluated during a smaller qualitative study, 'Whitu: seven ways in seven days' is a well-being app that, as its name suggests, contains seven modules to help young people (1) recognise and rate emotions, (2) learn relaxation and mindfulness, (3) practice self-compassion and (4) gratitude, (5) connect with others, (6) care for their physical health and (7) engage in goal-setting. It can be completed within a week or as desired. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in well-being on the WHO 5-item Well-Being Index and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, anxiety on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, self-compassion on the Self Compassion Scale-Short Form, stress on the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, sleep on the single-item Sleep Quality Scale and user engagement on the end-user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and via qualitative feedback during an online survey. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks (primary study endpoint) and 3 months, and analysed using linear mixed models with group, time and a group-time interaction. RESULTS: At 4 weeks, participants in the Whitu group experienced significantly higher emotional (Mean difference (md) 13.19 (3.96 to 22.42); p=0.005) and mental (md 2.44 (0.27 to 4.61); p=0.027) well-being, self-compassion (md 0.56 (0.28 to 0.83); p<0.001) and sleep (md 1.13 (0.24 to 2.02); p=0.018), and significantly lower stress (md -4.69 (-7.61 to -1.76); p=0.002) and depression (md -5.34 (-10.14 to -0.53); p=0.030), compared with the waitlist controls. Group differences remained statistically significant at 3 months for all outcomes. Symptoms of anxiety were also lower in the intervention group at 4 weeks (p=0.096), with statistically significant differences at 3 months (md -2.31 (-4.54 to -0.08); p=0.042). Usability of Whitu was high (subjective ratings of 4.45 (0.72) and 4.38 (0.79) out of 5 at 4 weeks and 3 months, respectively) and qualitative feedback indicated individual and cultural acceptability of the app. CONCLUSIONS: Given the evolving psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, Whitu could provide a clinically effective and scalable means of improving the well-being, mental health and resilience of young people.

The goal of the present study was to examine whether a Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) program could increase self-compassion and grit among elite female athletes compared to an active control condition. To this end, we performed a randomized trial among female adult athletes. METHODS: Forty female adult athletes (M(age) = 22.22, SD = 2.40) were randomly assigned either to the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment group (n = 20; 7 group sessions, 60 min each) or the active control group (n = 20; 7 group sessions, 60 min each). At baseline, seven weeks later at the end of the study and again four weeks later at follow-up, participants completed a series of self-rating questionnaires on mindfulness, self-compassion and grit. RESULTS: Dimensions of mindfulness, self-compassion and grit improved over time, but more so in the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment condition compared to the active control condition. Improvements remained stable from the study end to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: While the active control condition improved dimensions of mindfulness, self-compassion and grit among female adult athletes, improvements were much stronger in the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment condition. Importantly, improvements in the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment condition remained stable over a time lapse of four weeks at follow-up after study completion, suggesting that the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment intervention appeared to improve cognitive-emotional learning processes.",

Behaviors involving transportation, diet, energy use, and purchasing drive greenhouse gas emissions, but are also related to health and well-being, providing opportunity for co-benefits. Replacing shorter automobile trips with walking or cycling, or eating plants rather than animals, for example, may increase personal health, while also reducing environmental impact. Mindfulness-based practices have been shown to enhance a variety of health outcomes, but have not been adapted towards environmental purposes. We designed the Mindful Climate Action (MCA) curriculum to help people improve their health while simultaneously lowering their carbon footprints. Combining mindfulness-based practices with the Stages of Change theory, the MCA program aims to: (1) improve personal health and well-being; (2) decrease energy use; (3) reduce automobile use; (4) increase active transport; (5) shift diet towards plant-based foods; and (6) reduce unnecessary purchasing. Mindfulness practices will foster attentional awareness, openness, and response flexibility, supporting positive behavior change. We plan to test MCA in a randomized controlled trial, with rigorous assessment of targeted outcomes. Our long-term goal is to refine and adapt the MCA program to a variety of audiences, in order to enhance public health and environmental sustainability.",

Results: Increase of self-compassion mediated improvement of positive mental health at 6-month follow-up. Improvement of mindfulness skills or self-compassion did not mediate the reduction in ADHD symptoms. Additional analyses suggest that self-reported inhibition did. Conclusion: The effect of MBCT on ADHD symptoms and positive mental health thus occurred via different mechanisms of change, that is, by improvements in inhibition and self-compassion, respectively.",

Self-compassion interventions seem to be effective for women's body dissatisfaction, however, such interventions have not been trialed with men, including sexual minority men, who are particularly vulnerable. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a brief self-compassion intervention designed to reduce body dissatisfaction among sexual minority men (N = 605). We used a 3 (condition: self-compassion, self-esteem, and a benign recollection control) * 5 (time) repeated measures design, whereby participants completed a brief writing task and completed body image measures at multiple time-points. Participants in both the self-compassion and self-esteem conditions showed improved body image and self-compassion following the intervention whereas participants in the control condition did not. Increases in self-compassion mediated body image measures for participants in the self-compassion but not self-esteem or control conditions. Participants in the self-compassion condition also showed increased self-compassion at three-weeks follow-up. While several caveats to our results were noted, our overall interpretation is that self-compassion and self-esteem interventions might be effective for sexual minority men's body image, and more research is necessary.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether group loving-kindness meditation is noninferior to group cognitive processing therapy for treatment of PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical noninferiority trial assessed PTSD and depression at baseline, posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Veterans were recruited from September 24, 2014, to February 5, 2018, from a large Veternas Affairs medical center in Seattle, Washington. A total of 184 veteran volunteers who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for PTSD were randomized. Data collection was completed November 28, 2018, and data analyses were conducted from December 10, 2018, to November 5, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention comprised 12 weekly 90-minute group sessions. Loving-kindness meditation (n = 91) involves silent repetition of phrases intended to elicit feelings of kindness for oneself and others. Cognitive processing therapy (n = 93) combines cognitive restructuring with emotional processing of trauma-related content. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Co-primary outcomes were change in PTSD and depression scores over 6-month follow-up, assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; range, 0-80; higher is worse) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS; reported as standardized T-score with mean [SD] of 50 [10] points; higher is worse) depression measures. Noninferiority margins were 5 points on the CAPS-5 and 4 points on the PROMIS depression measure. RESULTS: Among the 184 veterans (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [13.1] years; 153 men [83.2%]; 107 White participants [58.2%]) included in the study, 91 (49.5%) were randomized to the loving-kindness group, and 93 (50.5%) were randomized to the cognitive processing group. The mean (SD) baseline CAPS-5 score was 35.5 (11.8) and mean (SD) PROMIS depression score was 60.9 (7.9). A total of 121 veterans (66%) completed 6-month follow-up. At 6 months posttreatment, mean CAPS-5 scores were 28.02 (95% CI, 24.72-31.32) for cognitive processing therapy and 25.92 (95% CI, 22.62-29.23) for loving-kindness meditation (difference, 2.09; 95% CI, -2.59 to 6.78), and mean PROMIS depression scores were 61.22 (95% CI, 59.21-63.23) for cognitive processing therapy and 58.88 (95% CI, 56.86-60.91) for loving-kindness meditation (difference, 2.34; 95% CI, -0.52 to 5.19). In superiority analyses, there were no significant between-group differences in CAPS-5 scores, whereas for PROMIS depression scores, greater reductions were found for loving-kindness meditation vs cognitive processing therapy (for patients attending \u22656 visits, \u22654-point improvement was noted in 24 [39.3%] veterans receiving loving-kindness meditation vs 9 (18.0%) receiving cognitive processing therapy; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among veterans with PTSD, loving-kindness meditation resulted in reductions in PTSD symptoms that were noninferior to group cognitive processing therapy. For both interventions, the magnitude of improvement in PTSD symptoms was modest. Change over time in depressive symptoms was greater for loving-kindness meditation than for cognitive processing therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01962714.",

There is growing evidence of how compassion training enhances psychological and physical well-being, however, there are very few studies analyzing the efficacy of compassion-based Interventions on BC survivors. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of the Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) protocol in a BC survivor sample on quality of life, psychological well-being, fear of cancer recurrence, self-compassion, and compassion domains and mindfulness facets. Furthermore, enrollment, adherence, and satisfaction with the intervention were also analyzed. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was designed. Participants (n = 56) were randomly assigned to CBCT (n = 28) or a treatment-as-usual control group (TAU; n = 28). Pre-post intervention and 6-month follow-up measures took place to evaluate health-related quality of life, psychological well-being; psychological stress, coping strategies, and triggering cognitions; self-compassion and compassion; and mindfulness in both intervention and wait-list groups. RESULTS: Accrual of eligible participants was high (77%), and the drop-out rate was 16%. Attendance to CBCT sessions was high and practice off sessions exceeded expectations). CBCT was effective in diminishing stress caused by FCR, fostering self-kindness and common humanity, and increasing overall self-compassion scores, mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets. CONCLUSION: CBCT could be considered a promising and potentially useful intervention to diminish stress caused by FCR and enhance self-kindness, common humanity, overall self-compassion, mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets. Nevertheless, future randomized trials are needed and a process of deeper cultural adaptation required.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions may represent a promising intervention approach to the global mental health crisis of forced displacement. Specifically, Mindfulness-Based Trauma Recovery for Refugees (MBTR-R)-a mindfulness- and compassion-based, trauma-sensitive, and socioculturally adapted intervention for refugees and asylum-seekers-has recently demonstrated randomized control evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety. Yet, little is known about potential mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects for trauma recovery and for refugees and asylum-seekers. METHOD: Thus, we examined adaptive and maladaptive forms of self-referentiality, namely self-compassion and self-criticism, as mechanisms of action for trauma recovery in a randomized wait-list control trial of MBTR-R among a community sample of 158 traumatized and chronically stressed asylum-seekers (46% female) in an urban postdisplacement setting (Middle East). Self-compassion and self-criticism were measured vis-a-vis an experimental Self-Referential Encoding Task (SRET) designed to quantify cognitive processes underlying self-compassion and self-criticism using diffusion modeling, a computational modeling approach to quantify cognitive processes underlying decision-making from behavioral reaction time data. RESULTS: Findings indicate that self-compassion and self-criticism were associated with trauma- and stress-related psychopathology at preintervention. Relative to wait-list controls, MBTR-R led to significant elevation in self-compassion, and reduction in self-criticism, from pre to postintervention. Finally, pre to postintervention change in self-criticism significantly mediated therapeutic effects of MBTR-R on depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) outcomes, while pre to postintervention change in self-compassion only mediated therapeutic effects on PTSD outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings speak to the importance of (mal)adaptive self-referentiality as a target mechanism in MBIs and trauma recovery broadly, and among refugees and asylum-seekers specifically.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is garnering increasing empirical interest as an intervention for Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), although no studies of mindfulness as a standalone treatment have included a sample composed entirely of patients with BDD or a comparison group. The aim of this study was to investigate the improvement of MBCT intervention on the core symptoms, emotional dysfunction, and executive function of BDD patients, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training. METHOD: Patients with BDD were randomized into an 8-week MBCT group (n = 58) or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group (n = 58) and were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants who received MBCT showed greater improvement on self-reported and clinician ratings of BDD symptoms, self-reported emotion dysregulation symptoms and executive function compared with TAU participants. Improvement for executive function tasks was partially supported. In addition, feasibility and acceptability of MBCT training were positive. LIMITATIONS: There is no systematic assessment of the severity of key potential outcome variables associated with BDD. CONCLUSION: MBCT may be a useful intervention for patients with BDD, improving patients' BDD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and executive functioning.",

        "title": "Embodied Cognition in Meditation, Yoga, and Ethics-An Experimental Single-Case Study on the Differential Effects of Four Mind-Body Treatments.",
        "abstract": "Yoga is an embodied contemplative practice considered as a path toward long-term well-being, which fosters an integrated processing of bodily and emotional stimuli. However, little is known about how the different components of yoga contribute to these processes. This was the aim of this single-case multiple-baseline study. Herein, we explored how different yoga components affect body awareness, emotion regulation, affectivity, self-compassion, and distress tolerance. Forty-two randomly assigned participants (from initially fifty-seven) completed one of four 8-week treatments: Mantra meditation alone (MA), meditation plus physical yoga (MY), meditation plus ethical education (ME), and meditation plus yoga and ethical education (MYE). Participants had no prior regular yoga or meditation practice. Data were analyzed using visual inspection, effect size estimation, and multilevel modeling. Surprisingly, all four treatments similarly improved body awareness (Tau-U(MA) = 0.21 to Tau-U(MY) = 0.49), emotion regulation (Tau-U(MYE) = -0.43 to Tau-U(ME) = -0.52), self-compassion (\u03b7(2) = 0.08), and distress tolerance (\u03b7(2) = 0.13). These effects were maintained until follow-up at 2 and 12 months after the study, even though home practice declined. The MA condition had the least favorable effect on affective experience (Tau-U(MA) = -0.14 and 0.07), while the ME condition enhanced valence the most (Tau-U(ME) = 0.10) and the MY condition was the most effective in preventing negative affective responses. Although mantra meditation on its own negatively influenced daily affect, it can be assumed as the driving force behind the improvement in the other variables. This points to the central role of meditation in increasing interoception, self-awareness, and embodied processing.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nurses tend to be vulnerable to burnout and compassion fatigue due to constant workplace stressors. There is a need to provide advocacy, education, programming, and resources in the areas of positive coping and self-care to reduce burnout symptoms and promote well-being. RISE is an 8-week psychoeducational group intervention for nurses with four themes: resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. AIMS: This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of RISE on mental well-being. METHODS: The sample included 75 registered nurses who work in a hospital-based setting. Outcomes included resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, stress mind-set, perceived stress, and burnout. Independent-samples t tests were conducted to compare outcomes between intervention and wait-list control groups at baseline and 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Supplemental analyses included paired-samples t tests and linear mixed models to compare the outcomes of the intervention group participants at baseline to 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group showed improved levels of insight (i.e., engagement in self-reflection), perceived stress, and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) when compared with the control group and improved levels of resilience, self-compassion, stress mind-set, and perceived stress when compared with their baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs how RISE affects nurse well-being and may be an effective intervention for reducing burnout and stress. This type of whole-person intervention can support nurses to improve their well-being and ability to cope amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational levels.",

        "abstract": "Digital mindfulness-based interventions (d-MBIs) have garnered significant research interest in recent years due to their psychological benefits. However, little is known about their impact on prosocial behaviors. This study investigates how d-MBIs impact prosocial behaviors where time spent is money, with Chinese adolescents as the subjects, through an online charity task (www.freerice.com). 119 students from a high school in China, who were inexperienced with mindfulness meditation, participated in this randomized controlled trial. The d-MBI group (N = 39) received online MBI guidance, while the face-to-face mindfulness-based intervention (f-MBI, N = 43) group underwent mindfulness intervention under personal tutors. The active control group (N = 37) completed a crossword task. Data analysis first involved repeated measures variance analysis, including pre-and post-intervention assessments. Subsequently, a two-way variance analysis was performed, with gender (female and male) and group (d-MBI, f-MBI, active control) as independent variables and the number of grains as dependent variables for the three groups of participants. Results showed that d-MBIs effectively improved empathy and compassion in Chinese adolescents, leading to increased rice donations to the United Nations World Food Program. These results underscore the positive effect of d-MBIs on prosociality and suggest their applicability in beneficial real-world situations involving prosocial behaviors, extending beyond previous research primarily conducted in artificial and hypothetical scenarios.",

Used in the context of general health, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have also showed positive effects when targeting changes to overweight-related eating behaviors. Methods: This study consists of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted with 284 women from primary health care units. Data were collected from the last session with 16 focus groups, considering each intervention group (mindfulness or mindful eating) Aim: This article aims to present the perceptions of low-income overweight women who participated in Mindfulness and Mindful Eating intervention groups in primary health care according to each type of intervention. Results: Seven themes were identified: course challenges; valorization of the teacher's attitudes; mindfulness understanding; self-awareness development; change of expectations; development of a different food-weight relationship; and discover of a wide range of benefits. Conclusion: Mindfulness and Mindful eating interventions affect not only an individual's relationship with body and food, but also life and human relations. The results indicate the feasibility of the intervention, which addresses a large number of patients who lack treatment options for overweight or emotional and psychological issues associated with this condition. MBIs such as mindful eating are applicable in primary health care facilities, targeting overweight women and supporting treatment by addressing a repressed demand in the system. Similar to mind-body therapies, these interventions allow for comprehensive care.ClinicalTrials.gov, (NCT02893150) on 30 March 2017.",

Healthy undergraduate students (N = 95) were assigned to either a self-care intervention or passive control condition. The intervention group (N = 52) was prompted daily via email with questions about self-care habits and plans over three weeks, whereas the control group (N = 43) only completed baseline and post-assessments. Primary outcome variables included subjective happiness, positive and negative affect, and stress. Explanatory variables included mindfulness, self-compassion, and active coping tendency. Stress and negative affect decreased in the intervention group relative to the control group, but no interaction was observed for happiness and positive affect. There was no evidence that these effects were moderated by participant mindfulness, coping tendency, or self-compassion. These results suggest that even a very brief daily reflection on self-care can have powerful effects in promoting resilience against the accumulation of negative affect and stress over the term.",

The present study evaluates a psychotherapeutic mindfulness- and self-compassion-based group intervention (MSCBI) with and without animal-assistance for patients with acquired brain injury. Patients (N = 31) were randomly assigned to the 6-week intervention with (n = 14) or without animal-assistance (n = 17). Primary outcome was psychological distress at post- and follow-up treatment, secondary outcomes were changes within-session of patients' emotional states, adherence to treatment and attrition. Psychological distress significantly decreased in both groups from pre- to follow-up treatment with no difference between groups. Patients in the animal-assisted MSCBI group reported significantly higher increases in feeling secure, accepted, comforted, grateful, motivated and at ease during the sessions compared to patients in the MSCBI group without animal-assistance. Adherence to sessions was significantly higher in the animal-assisted MSCBI group. Attrition did not significantly differ between groups. Our results show that both MSCBIs with and without animal-assistance are feasible and effective in reducing psychological distress in patients with acquired brain injury. The significant changes within-sessions mainly in relationship-based emotional states and the higher treatment adherence suggest additional effects of animal-assistance. Animal-assistance might increase acceptability and patients' commitment to psychotherapy.",

        "abstract": "The benefits of mindfulness meditation among clinical and non-clinical populations have been largely reported in literature. Existing mindfulness-based programs are particularly useful in targeting specific populations while researchers have pointed out the possibility of developing programs adapted to the audience and the context. In this two-groups pre-post experimental design we developed a mindfulness-based social intervention program to target individuals from the general population. Here we present a two-groups pre-post experimental design to investigate its effectiveness on participants' psychological functioning assessed by eight self-reported questionnaires (CORE-OM, FFMQ, SWLS, PANAS, PSS, SCS, WEMWBS, SHS) which encompass different domains of well-being, mindfulness and emotional functioning. Participants, recruited on voluntary basis, were randomly allocated to treated or passive control groups and were aware of group allocation. The intervention comprises a 12-week meditation training in a big group that represents the social aspect of meditation. Data were analysed via a linear mixed effect model and intention to treat. Statistically significant results were obtained for global score of CORE-OM (beta = -0.20 [-0.30; -0.10], p = 0.0002), FFMQ (beta = 0.20 [0.12; -0.28], p < 0.0001), SWLS (beta = 1.43 [0.42; 2.45], p = 0.006), positive PANAS (beta = 1.99 [0.95; 3.04], p = 0.0002), negative PANAS (beta = -1.67 [-2.92; -0.43], p = 0.009), PSS (beta = -2.98 [-4.25; -1.71], p < 0.0001), WEMWBS (beta = 4.38 [2.93; 5.83], p < 0.0001) and SHS (beta = 1.43 [0.42; 2.45], p = 0.006). Our intervention is causally associated with an improvement of the psychological functioning and hence can be considered as a preventive measure that may potentially reduce the risk of developing psychological problems and improve the subject's general well-being. Given the voluntary recruitment, our inference only applies to those individuals who have decided to experience meditation as a way to well-being and not to a random person from the general population.",

Personalized, in-the-moment text messaging support could be particularly useful for low-income smokers with fewer smoking cessation resources. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the feasibility of a text messaging program (iQuit Mindfully) as an adjunct to in-person Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment (MBAT) for smoking cessation. METHODS: A total of 71 participants were randomly assigned to MBAT (n=33) or iQuit Mindfully (n=38; MBAT + between-session text messages); of these, 70% (50/71) were African American, and 61% (43/71) had an annual household income of US $30,000 or less. All participants received 8 weekly therapist-led group counseling sessions, nicotine patches, and self-help materials. Outcomes were feasibility (attrition, engagement, and participants' ratings), participants' feedback regarding the text messaging intervention, and smoking cessation (assessed in person). RESULTS: Strong retention was achieved (76% [54/71] at the end of treatment, and 89% [63/71] at 1-month follow-up). In the iQuit Mindfully group, engagement was high (88% [29/33] indicated reading all or most texts, and 89% [34/38] engaged in interactive texting), and participants provided positive ratings (on a 1-10 scale, average rating for recommending the program to others was 8.4 [SD 2.5]). Participants indicated benefiting from the texts (eg, appreciating encouraging reminders, coping strategies, and social support) and suggested improvements (eg, more personalization). Overall, biochemically confirmed smoking cessation rates were 22% (12/55) at the end of treatment and 19% (12/62) at 1-month follow-up, with no differences between conditions. Living below the poverty level predicted worse cessation outcomes at 1-month follow-up among participants receiving in-person only treatment (P=.03) but not among those receiving iQuit Mindfully. CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging appears to be a feasible and acceptable modality for supporting mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. The availability of 24/7 text messaging might be particularly helpful for low-income smokers who have access to fewer cessation resources and experience significant day-to-day barriers to quitting.

        "abstract": "The opioid misuse epidemic has reached a crisis level in the United States. Though mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) has been shown as effective in treating substance use disorders, there is limited research on its application to opioid use disorders specifically, and there is a need to understand the underlying mechanisms. This paper outlines a protocol for a randomized controlled trial of MBRP for opioid use disorders. MBRP is a group aftercare program that integrates mindfulness skills training with cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention strategies. We will recruit 240 participants who have completed opioid use disorder treatment, and randomize them to an 8-week MBRP group intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) control group. The TAU control group will complete the intervention after 8 weeks. Assessments will take place at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. The primary outcome is frequency of opioid use. The secondary outcomes include craving and withdrawal symptoms, time to first opioid use, adherence to medication-assisted treatment plans, perceived stress, quality of life, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and chronic pain. We will also examine the following potential moderators and correlates of intervention outcomes: comorbid diagnoses, life events history, and MBRP intervention adherence. In addition, we will examine the following mediators of intervention outcome: mindfulness skills, emotion regulation skills, executive functioning skills, savoring, and positive and negative affect. This study will contribute to the evidence base regarding MBRP's efficacy in reducing opioid use, as well as contribute to the understanding of the causal mechanisms and factors that modify treatment outcome for MBRP for substance use disorders.",

Thus, the main objective of the present study was exploring the effects that the three separate components of self-compassion would have on shame-proneness levels in individuals with clinical depression. All the participants (n = 122) with a diagnostic of Major Depressive Disorder were randomized in four experimental groups: the self-kindness exercises group, the mindfulness exercises group, the common humanity one and the control group. Results indicated that levels of depression and shame-proneness, as measured by BDI-II, TOSCA-3 and ESS decreased from baseline to post-intervention, but no significant differences were observed between groups. Therefore, we cannot conclude that one self-compassion component is more efficient than the others, but the present study does offer, though, a strong starting point for more complex, future studies.",

Participants were allocated to the mobile app, the in-person mindfulness-based program (IMBP), or a control group. Assessments at baseline and postintervention (8 weeks) included measures of anxiety, empathy, self-compassion, and mindfulness. RESULTS: Of 168 students randomised, 84 were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (app: n = 31; IMBP: n = 23; control: n = 30). The mobile app group showed a large effect size for reductions in trait anxiety compared with controls (g = 0.85, p = 0.003), and a medium, nonsignificant effect compared with the IMBP group (g = 0.52, p = 0.152). Participants from both interventions experienced a significant increase in self-compassion and mindfulness compared with controls. Levels of empathy remained unchanged for the 3 arms.

Few mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in HCT recipients have shown feasibility, but heterogeneous practices and outcome measures have called into question the actual benefit. We hypothesized that self-guided isha kriya, a 12-minute guided meditation based on the principles of yoga focusing on breathing, awareness, and thought, as a mobile app would improve QoL in the acute HCT setting. This single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2021 to 2022. Autologous and allogeneic HCT recipients age \u226518 years were included. The study was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee and registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India, and all participants provided written informed consent. HCT recipients without access to smartphones or regular practitioners of yoga, meditation, or other mind-body practices were excluded. Participants were randomized to the control arm or the isha kriya arm at a 1:1 ratio stratified by type of transplantation. Patients in the isha kriya arm were instructed to perform the kriya twice daily from pre-HCT to day +30 post-HCT. The primary endpoint was QoL summary scores as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS-GH) questionnaires. The secondary endpoints were the differences in QoL domain scores. The validated questionnaires were self-administered before the intervention and at days +30 and +100 post-HCT. The analysis of endpoints was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Domain and summary scores were calculated for each instrument as recommended by the developers. A P value < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, and Cohen's d effect size was used to determine clinical significance. A total of 72 HCT recipients were randomized to the isha kriya and control arms. Patients in the 2 arms were matched for age, sex, diagnosis, and type of HCT. The 2 arms showed no differences in pre-HCT QoL domain, summary, and global scores. At day +30 post-HCT, there was no difference between the arms in the mean FACT-BMT total score (112.9 \u00b1 16.8 for the isha kriya arm versus 101.2 \u00b1 13.9 for the control arm; P = .2) or the mean global health score (global mental health, 45.1 \u00b1 8.6 versus 42.5 \u00b1 7.2 [P = .5]; global physical health, 44.1 \u00b1 6.3 versus 44.1 \u00b1 8.3 [P = .4]) in the 2 groups. Similarly, there were no differences in physical, social, emotional, and functional domain scores. However, the mean bone marrow transplantation (BMT) subscale scores, which addresses BMT-specific QoL concerns, were statistically and clinically significantly higher in the isha kriya arm (27.9 \u00b1 5.1 versus 24.4 \u00b1 9.2; P = .03; Cohen's d = .5; medium effect size). This effect was transient; mean day +100 scores showed no difference (28.3 \u00b1 5.9 versus 26.2 \u00b1 9.4; P = .3). Our data indicate that the isha kriya intervention did not improve the FACT-BMT total and global health scores in the acute HCT setting. However, practicing isha kriya for 1 month was associated with transient improvement in the FACT-BMT subscale scores on day +30 but not on day +100 post-HCT.",

We examined whether the distribution of meditation practices across a day impacted outcomes in a distressed population. We investigated the effects of meditation practice frequency in a 2-week compassion-based meditation intervention delivered via the Healthy Minds Program app. Undergraduates with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety (N = 351) were randomized to a massed (one 20-min meditation per day) or distributed condition (two 10-min meditations per day). Psychological distress (primary outcome; composite of depression and anxiety), experiential avoidance, fear of missing out, loneliness, and self-compassion were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Psychological distress, loneliness, and informal meditation practice were also assessed daily. Practice time and frequency were assessed using app data. Results support feasibility of the study design, success of the manipulation, and acceptability of the intervention. Pooled across conditions, participants exhibited pre-post improvements on all outcomes (absolute value of ds = 0.12-0.63, p <= .010) and trajectories of improvement on daily distress and loneliness (p <= .010). No between-group differences were observed on changes in pre-post or daily measures (ps = .158-.729). When total amount of meditation practice per day is held constant, the distribution of practice may not influence outcomes for distressed beginners. Although only a first test of dose frequency effects, findings support flexibility in the distribution of meditation throughout the day, which may increase accessibility.

Participants were randomly assigned to a self-compassionate writing, attentional-control writing, or wait-list control condition for one week, and completed measures of self-compassion, affirming self-perceptions, and stigmatizing self-perceptions at baseline, one-week post intervention, and one-month post intervention. A series of mixed AN(C)OVAs revealed no significant effects by condition or time on stigmatizing or affirming self-views toward the body when controlling for self-esteem, internalized weight stigma, and eating disorder symptomatology. Follow-up exploratory analyses demonstrated no significant effects by condition on the six facets of self-compassion. Notably, participants were significantly more likely to drop out from the study over time if they were lower in self-compassion and self-esteem, and higher in internalized weight stigma at baseline. These results suggest that online self-compassion writing interventions may need to be longer and more potent, especially for women with more entrenched and stigmatized views about their bodies, as well as potential boundary conditions of cultivating self-compassion in a short-term online intervention.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence for the longer-term benefits of online mindfulness training for medical students, including in the reduction of stress and improved wellbeing, is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a novel online mindfulness training program on trait mindfulness, wellbeing and study engagement of medical students at program completion and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: This was a randomised waitlist control study of an 8-week, online, mindfulness-based intervention versus normal curriculum alone for medical students (N = 114). The primary outcome measures were the changes from baseline to program completion at Week 8 for self-reported trait mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale) and study engagement scores (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students). The secondary outcome measures were these score changes from baseline to 6-month follow up. Intervention and control students completed surveys at all three time points. Program adherence (Mindfulness Adherence Questionnaire) was also measured in the intervention group. RESULTS: The intervention group experienced modest but statistically significant improvements in mindfulness (9%, p = 0.0002), self-compassion (5%, p = 0.026), and study engagement (4%, p = 0.035) from baseline to Week 8. They also reported a sustained improvement of 5% (p = 0.017) in mindfulness scores at 6 months. The control group reported no significant changes at Week 8 or 6 Months. Between-group comparisons showed that compared to the control group, the intervention group improved significantly more in mindfulness (p = 0.0076), and statistically marginally more in study engagement (p = 0.0534) at Week 8. No statistically significant between-group differences were observed at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the small but growing body of evidence suggesting that online mindfulness-based interventions with minimal contact can improve, albeit in modest magnitude, mindfulness and possibly study engagement in medical students for the duration of a mindfulness program. Further refinements to the program may be important to maintain improvements in the longer-term. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number ACTRN12624000783527.",

        "abstract": "Negative self-referential processing has fruitfully been studied in unipolar depressed patients, but remarkably less in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). This exploratory study examines the relation between task-based self-referential processing and depressive symptoms in BD and their possible importance to the working mechanism of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for BD. The study population consisted of a subsample of patients with BD (n = 49) participating in an RCT of MBCT for BD, who were assigned to MBCT + TAU (n = 23) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 26). Patients performed the self-referential encoding task (SRET), which measures (1) positive and (2) negative attributions to oneself as well as (3) negative self-referential memory bias, before and after MBCT + TAU or TAU. At baseline, all three SRET measures were significantly related to depressive symptoms in patients with BD. Moreover, repeated measures analyses of variance revealed that negative self-referential memory bias diminished over time in the MBCT + TAU group, compared with the TAU group. Given the preliminary nature of our findings, future research should explore the possibly mediating role of reducing negative self-referential memory bias in preventing and treating depressive symptoms in BD through MBCT.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Zentangle(R) is a self-help art modality purported to have repetitive, mindful, and meditative qualities. It can be a cost-effective intervention, but its effect on affective well-being has been underresearched. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate and 2-wk postintervention effects of Zentangle delivered by a certified Zentangle teacher on affective well-being in the general population. DESIGN: Two-armed parallel-groups pilot randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight participants from a nonclinical population. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized into the Zentangle group, which participated in a 2-hr Zentangle class and were encouraged to practice for 2 wk, or the waitlist control group. Participants learned basic Zentangle principles and drew two Zentangles under the teacher's instructions. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form were used to assess positive and negative affect; depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; and self-compassion. RESULTS: Significant reductions in negative affect were found in the Zentangle group compared with the waitlist control group at both immediate and 2-wk postintervention assessments (ds = 1.04 and 0.79, respectively, p < .001). Participants who practiced Zentangle for >80 min per week had a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and an improvement in self-compassion (ds = 0.84 and 0.24, ps < .05 and .005, respectively). No significant between-groups difference was found for other measures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results shed light on the effects of Zentangle on improving affective well-being in the general population. With sufficient practice, Zentangle can also help improve self-compassion and reduce anxiety. What This Article Adds: The results of this study could provide information to determine whether Zentangle can be used as a tool in occupational therapy intervention to improve affective well-being.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a brief self-compassion intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes and disordered eating behaviour. METHODS: Twenty-seven adolescents with type 1 diabetes were recruited and randomized to receive the brief (two 2.5-h sessions) self-compassion intervention, either in the intervention group (n=11) or in a waitlist control group (n=8). The intervention was adapted from the standardized eight-session 'Making Friends with Yourself' programme, and sessions were delivered 1 week apart. Acceptability was assessed through qualitative questionnaires and feasibility was assessed based on session attendance and recruitment metrics. Possible changes to disordered eating behaviour, self-care behaviours, diabetes-related distress, self-compassion, stress and glycaemic control were also assessed. RESULTS: Nineteen participants completed the study, and they reported an increased sense of common humanity (acknowledging that we are not alone), mindfulness, and coping resources. In terms of feasibility, recruitment took longer than expected (8 months) and not all participants were able to attend both sessions (nine could only attend one of the two sessions). CONCLUSIONS: While self-compassion is a strong conceptual fit for the issues of type 1 diabetes and disordered eating behaviour in adolescence, and the intervention content appears acceptable, feasibility issues were such that brief self-compassion programmes will probably need to be adapted into digital interventions for future research.

        "abstract": "The ability to accurately infer others' mental states from facial expressions is important for optimal social functioning and is fundamentally impaired in social cognitive disorders such as autism. While pharmacologic interventions have shown promise for enhancing empathic accuracy, little is known about the effects of behavioral interventions on empathic accuracy and related brain activity. This study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to investigate the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation program, cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic accuracy. Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, changes in dmPFC and IFG activity from baseline to the post-intervention assessment were associated with changes in empathic accuracy. These findings suggest that CBCT may hold promise as a behavioral intervention for enhancing empathic accuracy and the neurobiology supporting it.",

        "abstract": "Compassion is a key motivator of altruistic behavior, but little is known about individuals' capacity to cultivate compassion through training. We examined whether compassion may be systematically trained by testing whether (a) short-term compassion training increases altruistic behavior and (b) individual differences in altruism are associated with training-induced changes in neural responses to suffering. In healthy adults, we found that compassion training increased altruistic redistribution of funds to a victim encountered outside of the training context. Furthermore, increased altruistic behavior after compassion training was associated with altered activation in brain regions implicated in social cognition and emotion regulation, including the inferior parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and in DLPFC connectivity with the nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that compassion can be cultivated with training and that greater altruistic behavior may emerge from increased engagement of neural systems implicated in understanding the suffering of other people, executive and emotional control, and reward processing.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction on objective and subjective sleep parameters and hypnotic medication use of patients with insomnia secondary to cervical cancer. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial enrolled insomnia patient who were caused or worsened by cervical cancer. Seventy patients with insomnia caused or aggravated by cervical cancer were at random divided into either a usual care group or an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction group. Subjective sleep parameters, objective sleep parameters and hypnotic medication consumption were assessed at baseline, after the program, 6- and 12-month after finishing the interventions. RESULTS: The results showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction had a positive effect on subjective sleep parameters (Total wake time: \u2206 = 45.32, P < 0.05; Sleep efficacy: \u2206 = 6.87, P < 0.05; Total sleep time: \u2206 = 22.22, P < 0.01). Compared with control group, polysomnography data in mindfulness-based stress reduction group were not improved significantly.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of a structured eight-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) program on counseling self-efficacy among counseling trainees. METHODS: Undergraduate counseling trainees were randomized to an MBCT group (n = 25) or a waitlist control group (n = 25) with a crossover trial design. Psychological measurements regarding mindfulness, empathy, self-compassion, psychological distress, counseling self-efficacy as well as neuro-physiological measures including frontal midline theta activity, respiration rate, and skin conductance were taken at baseline (T1), after intervention (T2), and six-month follow-up (T3). RESULTS: Mindfulness training could make significant positive changes in empathy, self-compassion, stress reduction, and counseling self-efficacy with this being backed up by both psychological and neuro-physiological evidence at T2. However, such differences between the two groups had greatly subsided after crossover in which carry-over effect and marked improvement were noted in the study and control group, respectively, at T3. In addition, mindfulness was the most significant determinant that contributed to counseling self-efficacy, followed by psychological distress reduction and self-compassion according to the regression models. CONCLUSION: Integrating mindfulness into counseling training is beneficial for helping profession trainees. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Incorporating mindfulness into counseling training can enhance the necessary \"being mode\" qualities in counseling and address self-care issues during training.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression in dementia is common and associated with negative health outcomes. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a recommended treatment of choice for recurrent depression, but its use for depression in dementia is yet to be assessed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences of people with depression and dementia who participated in the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention and those of their carers and facilitators. METHODS: This qualitative study was nested within a randomised controlled feasibility study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 people (eight people with dementia and depression, six carers and four course facilitators). Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Several beneficial effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy were described. These were a sense of shared suffering among the group, greater present moment focus and awareness, various positive emotional changes, including greater self-compassion, and benefits for carers, such as the reduction of anxiety. Specific aspects of the programme were identified as particularly useful, including facilitator characteristics and certain mindfulness practices. Carer involvement, cognitive difficulties and barriers to home practice influenced engagement with the course. Facilitators described adaptations made to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and suggested additional modifications for future groups. CONCLUSION: Results of this process evaluation suggest that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a potentially useful intervention for people with depression in dementia, but that further adaptation of the intervention is required to make the programme suitable for this clinical population.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of a 6-week workplace mindfulness- and self-compassion-based intervention (MSCBI) on perceived stress, burnout, immune functioning (assessed with the biomarker Immunoglobulin A), self-compassion, and experiential avoidance compared to a Workplace Stress Management Intervention. Both interventions were contextual, i.e., they were carried out in the workplace setting and during working hours. We followed a randomised controlled trial study design. The total sample was composed of 24 employees of an automotive company. One-way analyses of covariance between groups revealed significant differences in post-intervention levels of perceived stress, salivary Immunoglobulin A (sIgA), emotional exhaustion, self-compassion, and experiential avoidance, after adjusting for pre-test scores. The results of this study have several implications. Firstly, it confirms that MSCBIs might be more effective than regular psychoeducational interventions for work-related stress and burnout treatment. Secondly, sIgA can be used to assess immune function state changes when MSCBIs are carried out. Furthermore, these results indicate that it is feasible to carry out MSCBIs within companies and during working hours, and that these interventions can help effectively manage stress and burnout associated with the work environment.",

        "abstract": "Loneliness, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of existing mindfulness and compassion-based intervention are effective, but are time-intensive, decreasing overall accessibility and scalability. Single-session interventions (SSIs) serve as a promising alternative. The current pre-registered randomized clinical trial evaluated a newly developed, manualized, mindfulness-based single-session intervention. 91 adults were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) one-hour mindfulness only telehealth intervention; (b) one-hour mindfulness and compassion telehealth intervention; or (c) one-week waitlist control (before randomization to an active intervention). Intervention sessions were conducted by graduate students in clinical psychology. The primary outcome was self-reported loneliness; secondary outcomes were self-reported perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. Using Bayesian multilevel models, we found that compared to the waitlist-control, the inclusion of a compassion component led to meaningful reductions in perceived stress b = -3.75, 95% HDI [-6.95, -0.59], anxiety b = -3.79, 95% HDI [-6.99, -0.53], and depression b = -3.01, 95% HDI [-5.22, -0.78], but not loneliness at the 1-week follow-up. Results suggest that a single-session mindfulness and compassion intervention may lead to meaningful reductions in perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression, but not loneliness.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based treatment for depression. The current study focused on the long-term outcomes of MBCT for chronically, treatment-resistant depressed patients during a 6-months follow-up period. Additionally, predictors of treatment outcomes were explored. METHOD: The outcomes of MBCT on depressive symptoms, remission rates, quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion were investigated in a cohort of chronically, treatment-resistant depressed outpatients (N = 106), who had taken part in an RCT comparing MBCT with treatment-as-usual (TAU). Measures were assessed pre-MBCT, post-MBCT, at 3-months follow-up, and at 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: Results of linear mixed effect models and Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA's reveal that depressive symptoms, quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion consolidated during follow-up. Remission rates even further increased over the course of follow-up. When controlling for symptoms at baseline, higher baseline levels of rumination predicted lower depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6-month follow-up. No other predictors (i.e. duration of current depressive episode, level of treatment-resistance, childhood trauma, mindfulness skills, self-compassion) were found. LIMITATIONS: All participants received MBCT, therefore time or other non-specific effects might have influenced the results and replication studies including a control conditions are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the clinical benefits of MBCT for chronically, treatment-resistant depressed patients persist up to 6 months after completing MBCT. Duration of the current episode, level of treatment-resistance, childhood trauma and baseline levels of mindfulness skills and self-compassion did not predict treatment outcome. When controlling for baseline depressive symptoms participants with high levels of rumination seem to benefit more; however more research is needed.

The current study explored whether trait self-compassion or induced state self-compassion could improve dietary choice and food craving after a stress induction. METHOD: Fifty-three university students completed an online survey assessing self-compassion, eating restraint, and general perceived stress before attending a laboratory visit. In the laboratory, participants were randomised to a neutral writing control or a self-compassion letter writing condition before a stress induction. Measures of heart rate, heart rate variability, state self-compassion, dietary choice, and state food cravings were taken. RESULTS: The brief self-compassion intervention did not sufficiently increase state self-compassion in the intervention group compared to the neutral writing condition. There was no effect of the written self-compassion intervention on heart rate, heart rate variability, dietary choice, or food craving. However, higher trait self-compassion was associated with healthier dietary choices (F(1, 49) = 5.35, p = .025, R(2) = .098). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that higher trait self-compassion improved dietary choice after stress in a controlled environment in a university population. Further research is warranted to explore whether brief self-compassion interventions can improve state self-compassion and thereby influence dietary choices and food cravings after a stress induction.",

Stress can increase the risk of depression, reduce quality of life (QOL), and possibly exacerbate disease activity in MS. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) may help, but has been little studied in MS, particularly among more disabled individuals. METHODS: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and likely effectiveness of a standard MBSR course for people with MS. Participant eligibility included: age > 18, any type of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) </= 7.0. Participants received either MBSR or wait-list control. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months later. Primary outcomes were perceived stress and QOL. Secondary outcomes were common MS symptoms, mindfulness, and self-compassion. RESULTS: Fifty participants were recruited and randomised (25 per group). Trial retention and outcome measure completion rates were 90% at post-intervention, and 88% at 3 months. Sixty percent of participants completed the course. Immediately post-MBSR, perceived stress improved with a large effect size (ES 0.93; p < 0.01), compared to very small beneficial effects on QOL (ES 0.17; p = 0.48). Depression (ES 1.35; p < 0.05), positive affect (ES 0.87; p = 0.13), anxiety (ES 0.85; p = 0.05), and self-compassion (ES 0.80; p < 0.01) also improved with large effect sizes. At three-months post-MBSR (study endpoint) improvements in perceived stress were diminished to a small effect size (ES 0.26; p = 0.39), were negligible for QOL (ES 0.08; p = 0.71), but were large for mindfulness (ES 1.13; p < 0.001), positive affect (ES 0.90; p = 0.54), self-compassion (ES 0.83; p < 0.05), anxiety (ES 0.82; p = 0.15), and prospective memory (ES 0.81; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment, retention, and data collection demonstrate that a RCT of MBSR is feasible for people with MS. Trends towards improved outcomes suggest that a larger definitive RCT may be warranted. However, optimisation changes may be required to render more stable the beneficial treatment effects on stress and depression.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Weight loss is hard to achieve and even harder to maintain. Engaging in effortful behavioural change to manage body weight can sometimes result in feelings of guilt and shame. Self-compassion, the tendency to find kindness for oneself in times of struggle, may facilitate coping with the unique challenges of weight management. This study assessed whether a remotely delivered self-compassion intervention improved weight management outcomes when delivered as a supplement to an existing digital behavioural weight management programme, Weight Watchers (WW). METHOD: Using a mixed-method study design, 249 adults seeking to manage weight were randomized to either the WW programme or WW supplemented with the self-compassion for weight management intervention (SC4WM). Participants completed measures of self-compassion, eating behaviour, physical activity, body weight and emotional well-being along with potential moderators, including weight self-stigma, eating restraint, psychological coping and perceived stress at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). RESULTS: There was no evidence that the SC4WM intervention had a significantly different effect than WW alone. Other than body weight, all outcomes improved over time in both groups. Self-compassion was slightly higher overall in the SC4WM group (p = .05), with this group reporting higher self-kindness at 4 weeks (p = .014) and lower self-judgement at 12 weeks (p = .023) compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the SC4WM intervention group did show a small increase in self-kindness and reduction in self-judgement, weight management outcomes were not improved over and above the existing WW programme. Recommendations for adapting the SC4WM intervention to improve efficacy to augment weight management outcomes are provided.",

        "abstract": "Repeated exposure to stressors, even if mild, may alter the efficiency of optimal stress responses and hinder emotion regulation skills. Mindfulness meditation, by strengthening self-regulation and awareness, may optimize the efficiency of physiological, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to stressful events but typically requires notable commitment to practice, which often leads to disengagement. Recent research suggested that such practices may be made more accessible and that the potential for self-enhancement and stress management of meditation might be improved by supporting mental training with wearable neurofeedback devices able to inform the practicer on ongoing modulation of bodily and brain activity. This study aimed at testing the effect of such novel training approach based on the integration of mental training with brain-sensing wearable devices on physiological (heart rate and variability) and subjective markers of stress (perceived stress, anxiety, and mood states). Participants (N = 55) have been randomly divided into an active control (CONTg) and an experimental group (EXPg). Both groups completed a four-week training constituted by brief daily activities based on mindfulness practices. Experimental participants practiced with the support of dedicated brain-sensing devices. By analyzing pre- and post-training assessments, we observed relevantly decreased stress and anxiety measures in EXPg, as well as relevantly decreased mental fatigue and increased vigor. EXPg also showed improved physiological markers of vagal tone both at rest and during exposure to a cognitive stressor. Reported findings add to the limited available literature on potential effects of technology-supported mental training protocols for promoting subjective well-being and enhancing self-regulation skills.",

Interviews were analysed using a thematic approach. Results Mindfulness-based stress reduction was well received in both groups, with participants describing a beneficial shift in awareness. An initial (at times unpleasant) increase in awareness of disability was generally followed by greater acceptance and self-compassion. Other benefits reported included improved relationships, walking and sleep, with less stress and pain. Mindful-movement and mindful walking were problematic in group 1. This component of mindfulness-based stress reduction was simplified in group 2. A pre-course orientation session was introduced, and some organisational changes made based on feedback from group 1. Feedback from group 2 was positive in all these areas.

Self-guided mindfulness-based interventions may be a way to increase access to the benefits of mindfulness. This study explored whether a brief, online, mindfulness-based intervention can increase mindfulness and reduce perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms within a student population. METHOD: One hundred and four students were randomly allocated to either immediately start a two-week, self-guided, online, mindfulness-based intervention or a wait-list control. Measures of mindfulness, perceived stress and anxiety/depression were administered before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis identified significant group by time interactions for mindfulness skills, perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms. Participation in the intervention was associated with significant improvements in all measured domains, where no significant changes on these measures were found for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This provides evidence in support of the feasibility and effectiveness of shorter self-guided mindfulness-based interventions. The limitations and implications of this study for clinical practice are discussed.",

        "title": "Online mindfulness-based intervention for women with pregnancy distress: design of a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological distress during pregnancy is common: up to 20% of the childbearing women experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. Apart from the adverse effects on the woman herself, pregnancy distress can negatively affect pregnancy outcomes, infant health, postpartum mother-child interaction and child development. Therefore, the development of interventions that reduce pregnancy distress is very important. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promising positive effects on pregnancy distress, but there is a need for randomized controlled trials with sufficient power. Trials on online MBIs, which are readily accessible and not expensive, also show positive effects on stress reduction in non-pregnant populations. Moreover, specific working mechanisms of MBIs remain unclear. The aim of the current study is to test the effectiveness of an online MBI in pregnant women with pregnancy distress, as well as exploring potential working mechanisms. METHODS: The current study is a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures. Consenting women with elevated levels of pregnancy distress will be randomized into an intervention group (MBI) or control group (care as usual) around 12 weeks of pregnancy, with an intended sample size of 103 women in each group. The primary outcome, pregnancy distress, will be assessed via questionnaires at baseline, halfway through the intervention and post intervention in both intervention and control group, and after 8 weeks follow-up in the intervention group. Secondary outcomes are mindfulness skills, rumination and self-compassion, which are also seen as potential working mechanisms, and will be assessed via questionnaires before intervention, halfway through the intervention, post intervention and after 8 weeks follow-up in the intervention group. Tertiary outcome variables are obstetric data and will be collected from the obstetric records for both intervention and control group. Analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Multilevel regression models for repeated measures (mixed models) will be used to evaluate changes in primary and secondary outcome variables. Tertiary outcomes will be compared between groups using independent t-tests and Chi Square analyses. DISCUSSION: The trial is expected to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of online MBIs during pregnancy in women with pregnancy distress and to evaluate potential working mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Mindfulness training has been used to improve emotional wellbeing in early adolescents. However, little is known about treatment outcome moderators, or individual differences that may differentially impact responses to treatment. The current study focused on gender as a potential moderator for affective outcomes in response to school-based mindfulness training. Sixth grade students (N = 100) were randomly assigned to either the six weeks of mindfulness meditation or the active control group as part of a history class curriculum. Participants in the mindfulness meditation group completed short mindfulness meditation sessions four to five times per week, in addition to didactic instruction (Asian history). The control group received matched experiential activity in addition to didactic instruction (African history) from the same teacher with no meditation component. Self-reported measures of emotional wellbeing/affect, mindfulness, and self-compassion were obtained at pre and post intervention. Meditators reported greater improvement in emotional wellbeing compared to those in the control group. Importantly, gender differences were detected, such that female meditators reported greater increases in positive affect compared to females in the control group, whereas male meditators and control males displayed equivalent gains. Uniquely among females but not males, increases in self-reported self-compassion were associated with improvements in affect. These findings support the efficacy of school-based mindfulness interventions, and interventions tailored to accommodate distinct developmental needs of female and male adolescents.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Compassion is critical for complementary and conventional care, but little is known about its direct physiologic effects. This study tested the feasibility of delivering two lengths of time (10 and 20 minutes) and two strategies (tactile and nontactile) for a practitioner to nonverbally communicate compassion to subjects who were blind to the interventions. METHODS: Healthy volunteers were informed that we were testing the effects of time and touch on the autonomic nervous system. Each subject underwent five sequential study periods in one study session: (1) warm-up; (2) control-with the practitioner while both read neutral material; (3) rest; (4) intervention-with practitioner meditating on loving-kindness toward the subject; and (5) rest. Subjects were randomized to receive one of four interventions: (1) 10 minutes tactile; (2) 20 minutes tactile; (3) 10 minutes nontactile; or (4) 20 minutes nontactile. During all interventions, the practitioner meditated on loving-kindness toward the subject. For tactile interventions, the practitioner touched subjects on arms, legs, and hands; for nontactile interventions, the practitioner pretended to read. Subjects' autonomic activity, including heart rate, was measured continuously. Subjects completed visual analog scales for well-being, including relaxation and peacefulness, at warm-up; postcontrol; immediately postintervention; and after the postintervention rest and were asked about what they and the practitioner had done during each study period. RESULTS: The 20 subjects' mean age was 24.3 \u00b1 4 years; 16 were women. The practitioner maintained a meditative state during all interventions as reflected in lower respiratory rate, and subjects remained blind to the practitioner's meditative activity. Overall, interventions significantly decreased heart rate (P < .01), and although other changes did not reach statistical significance, they were in the expected direction, with generally greater effects for the tactile than nontactile strategies and for 20-minute than 10-minute doses. CONCLUSIONS: Two strategies are feasible for blinding subjects to nonverbal communication of compassion; even with blinding, nonverbal communication of compassion affects subjects' autonomic nervous system. These results should be replicated in larger samples, including patient populations, and mechanisms sought to explain observed effects. Compassion is not only good care; it may also be good medicine.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have evaluated the possible efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, few trials have compared MBIs with a first-line treatment. This study evaluated the relative efficacy of an MBI adapted for SAD (MBI-SAD) to cognitive behaviour group therapy (CBGT) for SAD. Participants were randomized to 12 weekly group sessions of the MBI-SAD (n = 52) or CBGT (n = 45). Results revealed that CBGT fared better than the MBI-SAD in reducing clinician- and self-rated social anxiety severity. The difference between the MBI-SAD and CBGT exceeded the prespecified noninferiority margin for our primary outcome the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, but findings are inconclusive as the width of the confidence interval extended in both directions surrounding the noninferiority margin. The MBI-SAD compared favourably with CBGT in improving other indices of well-being (depression, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, social adjustment). Contrary to expectation, the MBI-SAD did not produce greater changes in mindfulness and self-compassion than CBGT. Overall, results confirm that CBGT is robust treatment for SAD and should be considered as first-line treatment.",

        "title": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder: protocol of a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a very disabling condition with a chronic course, if left untreated. Though cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) with or without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is the method of choice, up to one third of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not respond to treatment in terms of at least 35% improvement of symptoms. Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an 8-week group program that could help OCD patients with no or only partial response to CBT to reduce OC symptoms and develop a helpful attitude towards obsessions and compulsive urges. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a prospective, bicentric, assessor-blinded, randomized, actively-controlled clinical trial. 128 patients with primary diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-IV and no or only partial response to CBT will be recruited from in- and outpatient services as well as online forums and the media. Patients will be randomized to either an MBCT intervention group or to a psycho-educative coaching group (OCD-EP) as an active control condition. All participants will undergo eight weekly sessions with a length of 120 minutes each of a structured group program. We hypothesize that MBCT will be superior to OCD-EP in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) following the intervention and at 6- and 12-months-follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include depressive symptoms, quality of life, metacognitive beliefs, self-compassion, mindful awareness and approach-avoidance tendencies as measured by an approach avoidance task. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will elucidate the benefits of MBCT for OCD patients who did not sufficiently benefit from CBT. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled study assessing the effects of MBCT on symptom severity and associated parameters in OCD.

        "abstract": "Contemplative practices are believed to alleviate psychological problems, cultivate prosocial behavior and promote self-awareness. In addition, psychological science has developed tools and models for understanding the mind and promoting well-being. Additional effort is needed to combine frameworks and techniques from these traditions to improve emotional experience and socioemotional behavior. An 8-week intensive (42 hr) meditation/emotion regulation training intervention was designed by experts in contemplative traditions and emotion science to reduce \"destructive enactment of emotions\" and enhance prosocial responses. Participants were 82 healthy female schoolteachers who were randomly assigned to a training group or a wait-list control group, and assessed preassessment, postassessment, and 5 months after training completion. Assessments included self-reports and experimental tasks to capture changes in emotional behavior. The training group reported reduced trait negative affect, rumination, depression, and anxiety, and increased trait positive affect and mindfulness compared to the control group. On a series of behavioral tasks, the training increased recognition of emotions in others (Micro-Expression Training Tool), protected trainees from some of the psychophysiological effects of an experimental threat to self (Trier Social Stress Test; TSST), appeared to activate cognitive networks associated with compassion (lexical decision procedure), and affected hostile behavior in the Marital Interaction Task. Most effects at postassessment that were examined at follow-up were maintained (excluding positive affect, TSST rumination, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia recovery). Findings suggest that increased awareness of mental processes can influence emotional behavior, and they support the benefit of integrating contemplative theories/practices with psychological models and methods of emotion regulation.",

In this randomized controlled trial, our primary aim was to examine the impact of a brief mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on burnout, stress, mindfulness, compassion, and resilience among physicians. A total of 33 physicians completed the baseline assessment and were randomized to the Mindful Medicine Curriculum (MMC; n = 17) or waitlist control group (n = 16). Participants completed self-report measures at baseline, post-MBI, and 3-month follow-up. We also analyzed satisfaction with doctor communication (DCC) and overall doctor rating (ODR) data from patients of the physicians in our sample. Participants in the MMC group reported significant improvements in stress (P < .001), mindfulness (P = .05), emotional exhaustion (P = .004), and depersonalization (P = .01) whereas in the control group, there were no improvements on these outcomes. Although the MMC had no impact on patient-reported DCC or ODR, among the entire sample at baseline, DCC and ODR were significantly correlated with several physician outcomes, including resilience and personal achievement. Overall, these findings suggest that a brief MBI can have a positive impact on physician well-being and potentially enhance patient care.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore putative mediators of a mindfulness-based intervention to decrease distress in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to explore the patients' perspectives on this intervention. DESIGN: We used an explanatory mixed methods design incorporating quantitative data from a pilot randomized control trial and a qualitative interview study with people who completed the mindfulness intervention. METHODS: People with MS (n = 40) completed standardized measures of distress (outcome), and acceptance, decentring, self-compassion, and self-efficacy (potential mediators). Semi-structured interviews (n = 15) of patients' experiences of the mindfulness intervention were analysed deductively and inductively. RESULTS: Decentring post-intervention explained 13% of the 3-month change in distress and between 27% and 31% of concurrent changes in distress. Acceptance changed only slightly, and as a result, the indirect effect accounts for only 2% of future distress and between 3% and 11% of concurrent distress. Qualitative data showed that acceptance and self-compassion needed more time to develop, whereas decentring could be implemented readily after being introduced in the sessions. Self-efficacy also had a large mediating effect. Participants in their interviews talked about group dynamics and prior expectations as essential elements that determine their engagement with the course and their level of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness interventions for people with a chronic progressive condition may benefit from focusing on helping them to accept daily challenges and teach them to recognize their thoughts and feelings, allowing time for acceptance and self-compassion to develop. Group dynamics also play a fundamental role in the success of the mindfulness interventions. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Mindfulness courses improve psychological well-being for people with chronic conditions. Mindfulness courses have been successful in improving psychological well-being and symptom management for people with multiple sclerosis but we do not know how these courses work. What does this study add? Decentering and self-efficacy appear to be key mechanisms leading to reduced distress. Acceptance and self-compassion may need more time and practice to develop. Group dynamics and expectations of the mindfulness courses were also important elements of mindfulness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently gives rise to depressive and anxiety symptoms, but these are often undertreated. This study investigated the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) on psychological outcomes and quality of life (QoL), and whether they mediate treatment effects on MS-related cognitive problems. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included MS patients with cognitive complaints (n = 99) and compared MBCT (n = 32) and CRT (n = 32) to enhanced treatment as usual (n = 35). Baseline, post-treatment and 6-months follow-up assessments included patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and cognitive outcomes (self-reported and neuropsychological assessment). PROMS concerned psychological symptoms, well-being, QoL, and daily life function. Linear mixed models indicated intervention effects on PROMS and mediation effects of PROMS on cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: MBCT positively affected depressive symptoms (Cohen's d (d) = -0.46), fatigue (d = -0.39), brooding (d = -0.34), mindfulness skills (d = 0.49), and mental QoL (d = -0.73) at post-treatment. Effects on mindfulness skills remained significant 6 months later (d = 0.42). CRT positively affected depressive symptoms (d = -0.46), mindfulness skills (d = 0.37), and mental QoL (d = -0.45) at post-treatment, but not at 6-month follow-up. No effects on anxiety, well-being, self-compassion, physical QoL, and daily life function were found. Treatment effects on self-reported, but not objective, cognition were mediated by psychological symptoms and mindfulness skills. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT and CRT reduced a wide array of psychological symptoms and improved mental QoL. These improvements seemed to impact self-reported cognitive problems after both treatments, whereas objective cognitive improvements after MBCT seemed independent of improvement in psychological symptoms. Future studies should investigate long-term sustainability of these beneficial effects.

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of brief Mindfulness interventions on quantitative and qualitative stress parameters in patients undergoing imaging-guided breast biopsies. METHODS: Eighty-two women undergoing percutaneous imaging-guided breast biopsy were randomized into two groups: MBI group or standard care group. One week before the biopsy procedure, on the waiting room and during the biopsy procedure, the MBI group was exposed to mindfulness techniques and the standard care group received supportive dialogue from the biopsy team. Participants completed questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety and stress, demographics, and medical history, besides evaluating their pain experience through a visual analogue scale for pain and had their systolic and diastolic blood pressure, initial and final temperate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and salivary cortisol measured. RESULTS: Participation in the mindfulness intervention group was associated with reduced levels of perceived stress, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation compared to participation in the standard care group (P values < 0.05). No difference was observed regarding salivary cortisol levels, peripheral temperature, and pain perception between the two studied groups. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that an extremely brief mindfulness intervention is a feasible intervention, suggesting that Mindfulness-based programs may be beneficial to reduce discomfort in acutely stressful settings.",

In this study, we evaluate whether metacognition is trainable through generic meditation training, and if so, which component of meditation would be instrumental in this improvement. To this end, we evaluated participants' metacognitive efficiency before and after two types of meditation training protocols: the first focused on mental cues (Mental Monitoring [MM] training), whereas the second focused on body cues (Self-observation of the Body [SoB] training). Results indicated that while metacognitive efficiency was stable in MM training group, it was significantly reduced in the SoB group after training. This suggests that metacognition should not be conceived as a stable capacity but rather as a malleable skill.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is effective for relapse prevention in major depressive disorder (MDD). It reduces cognitive reactivity (CR) and rumination, and enhances self-compassion and mindfulness. Although rumination and mindfulness after MBCT are associated with relapse, the association of CR, rumination, self-compassion, and mindfulness with relapse before initiation of MBCT has never been investigated. METHODS: Data were drawn from two randomized controlled trials, including a total of 282 remitted MDD participants (\u22653 depressive episodes) who had been using maintenance antidepressant medication (mADM) for at least 6 months before baseline. All participants were offered MBCT while either their mADM was maintained or discontinued after MBCT. CR, rumination, self-compassion, and mindfulness were assessed at baseline by self-rated questionnaires and were used in Cox proportional hazards regression models to investigate their association with relapse. RESULTS: CR and mindfulness were associated with relapse, independent of residual symptoms, previous depressive episodes, and mADM-use. Higher CR and lower mindfulness increased the risk of relapse. Self-compassion was not associated with relapse. For rumination, a significant interaction with mADM-use was found. Rumination was associated with relapse in patients who discontinued their mADM, while this effect was absent if patients continued mADM. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that CR, rumination, and mindfulness are associated with relapse in remitted MDD-patients before initiation of MBCT, independent of residual symptoms and previous depressive episodes. This information could improve decisions in treatment planning in remitted individuals with a history of depression.",

        "abstract": "Much research has demonstrated the beneficial effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological and physical health, but it is not known whether MBSR may impact cellular aging in healthy populations. Further, little research has evaluated MBSR against an active control condition, which precludes strong conclusions regarding the unique effects of mindfulness on psychological functioning. The present study examined the effects of MBSR versus music therapy-based stress reduction (MTSR) on trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and several psychological health outcomes, as well as leukocyte telomere length (LTL). One hundred and fifty eight Singaporean Chinese adults were recruited and randomly assigned to an eight-week MBSR or MTSR course. Participants provided blood samples and completed a battery of self-report measures pre- and post-intervention. Analyses showed that participants in the MBSR condition demonstrated significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms, trait mindfulness, and self-compassion compared to the control condition. Treatment condition did not predict changes in LTL, anxiety, stress, or happiness, though there was a trend for duration of home mindfulness practice to predict increases in LTL. Overall, the study demonstrated MBSR's unique effects in reducing depressive symptoms. Improvements in trait mindfulness and self-compassion correspond with theorized mechanisms of change underlying mindfulness training. The lack of intervention effect with regards to LTL suggests that a more intensive intervention may be required for mindfulness to exert noticeable impact on aging at the cellular level, or that the effect may only emerge over a longer term.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People of color (POC) who experience race-related stress are at risk of developing mental health problems, including high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Mindfulness meditation may be especially well suited to help POC cope, given its emphasis on gaining awareness and acceptance of emotions associated with discriminatory treatment. However, mindfulness meditation rarely reaches POC, and digital approaches could reduce this treatment gap by addressing traditional barriers to care. OBJECTIVE: This study will test the effectiveness of a self-directed app-based mindfulness meditation program among POC who experience elevated levels of race-related stress. Implementation outcomes such as treatment acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction will be examined. METHODS: Participants (n=80) will be recruited online by posting recruitment materials on social media and sending emails to relevant groups. In-person recruitment will consist of posting flyers in communities with significant POC representation. Eligible participants will be block randomized to either the intervention group (n=40) that will complete a self-directed 4-week mindfulness meditation program or a wait-list control condition (n=40) that will receive access to the app after study completion. All participants will complete measures at baseline, midtreatment, and posttreatment. Primary outcomes include changes in stress, anxiety, and depression, and secondary outcomes constitute changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, rumination, emotion suppression, and experiential avoidance. Exploratory analyses will examine whether changes in the secondary outcomes mediate changes in primary outcomes. Finally, treatment acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction will be examined descriptively. RESULTS: Recruitment began in October 2021. Data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling, a statistical methodology that accounts for the dependence among repeated observations. Considering attrition issues in self-directed digital interventions and their potential effects on statistical significance and treatment effect sizes, we will examine data using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to provide data on the effectiveness of a self-directed app-based mindfulness meditation program for POC recruited based on elevated race-related stress, a high-risk population. Similarly, meaningful clinical targets for POC affected by stressors related to race will be examined. Findings will provide important information regarding whether this type of intervention is an acceptable treatment among these marginalized groups.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high level of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to find helpful coping mechanisms. Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case analyses. Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive symptoms (d = -0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (d = -0.52) and anxiety symptoms (d = -0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic.",

This might be due to high levels of shame and self-criticism. Self-compassion can be a mechanism of change, especially for patients with eating disorders and childhood trauma. METHOD: A total of 130 patients with or without childhood trauma were admitted to 13 weeks of inpatient treatment and randomized to either compassion-focused therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Self-compassion and eating disorder symptoms were measured every week. The data were analyzed for within-person effects using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: We did not find a within-person effect of self-compassion on eating disorder symptoms. Rather, the analysis indicated that eating disorder symptoms predict self-compassion in the overall sample. However, we found a stronger within-person relationship between self-compassion and eating disorder symptoms in patients with trauma receiving compassion-focused therapy compared to the remaining patients in the study. CONCLUSION: Overall, eating disorder symptoms predicted subsequent self-compassion at a within-person level. Patients with trauma in compassion-focused therapy demonstrated a stronger relationship between self-compassion and eating disorder symptoms. More studies with a cross-lagged design are needed to further illuminate self-compassion as a mechanism of change for these patients.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02649114.",

        "title": "Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Neuroticism (Stress Vulnerability): A Pilot Randomized Study.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neuroticism, a characteristic associated with increased stress vulnerability and the tendency to experience distress, is strongly linked to risk of different forms of psychopathology. However, there are few evidence-based interventions to target neuroticism. This pilot study investigated the efficacy and acceptability of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with an online self-help intervention for individuals with high levels of neuroticism. The MBCT was modified to address psychological processes that are characteristic of neuroticism. METHOD: Participants with high levels of neuroticism were randomized to MBCT (n=17) or an online self-help intervention (n=17). Self-report questionnaires were administered preintervention and again at 4weeks postintervention. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses found that MBCT participants had significantly lower levels of neuroticism postintervention than the control group. Compared with the control group, the MBCT group also experienced significant reductions in rumination and increases in self-compassion and decentering, of which the latter two were correlated with reductions in neuroticism within the MBCT group. Low drop-out rates, high levels of adherence to home practice, and positive feedback from MBCT participants provide indications that this intervention may be an acceptable form of treatment for individuals who are vulnerable to becoming easily stressed. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT specifically modified to target neuroticism-related processes is a promising intervention for reducing neuroticism. Results support evidence suggesting neuroticism is malleable and amenable to psychological intervention. MBCT for neuroticism warrants further investigation in a larger study.",

        "title": "Mindfulness-based and cognitive-based stress prevention in student teachers (startklar): study protocol of a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Teachers and student teachers in Germany are a high-risk population for stress and stress-related mental health problems. This often leads to early retirement in subsequent professional life. Various trials have demonstrated positive effects of stress prevention training on the perceived stress and stress-related symptoms of teachers. Although many studies show positive effects of mindfulness-based stress interventions, there is not yet any mindfulness-based intervention for teachers or student teachers in Germany. The aim of this trial is to evaluate a training that combines mindfulness-based and cognitive interventions into one programme, addressing to the specific burdens of student teachers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study protocol presents a prospective block-randomised controlled trial. Assessment will take place at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up) for an intervention and waiting control group, and at a fourth assessment point for the waiting control group after receiving the training. The aim is to evaluate the effects of mindfulness-based stress prevention on stress, psychological morbidity, burnout and self-efficacy using validated measures. Participants are student teachers from German teacher training colleges and participation will be voluntary. The targeted total sample size is 96 at 3-month follow-up. The training will comprise three 4-hour sessions conducted every 2 weeks. The control group will participate in the training after the 3-month follow-up. The allotment will be randomised with a stratified allocation ratio by gender. After descriptive statistics have been evaluated, inferential statistical analysis will be conducted using repeated measures analysis of variance with interactions between time and group. Effect sizes will be calculated using partial \u03b7(2) values. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will be disseminated at conferences, in specialist magazines and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial has been approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.192.16 (10511). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00010897.",

        "title": "Efficacy of a mindfulness and compassion-based intervention in psychotherapists and their patients: Empathy, symptomatology, and mechanisms of change in a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, mindfulness and compassion-based interventions (MCBI) have been found to beneficially influence the acquisition of essential skills in psychotherapy and are a promising way to improve relationships with patients. In this regard, new studies are needed to evaluate the effects of MCBI on psychotherapists and their patients and to analyze the influence of these effects on the processes and outcomes of psychotherapy. In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluate the efficacy of an MCBI in psychotherapists' mindfulness skills and self-reported empathy, as well as its indirect effect on patients (patient-reported psychotherapists' empathy, therapeutic bond, and symptomatology). Finally, we present a multilevel structural equation model (MSEM) to analyze the relationship between these variables in psychotherapists and their patients. A group of psychotherapists (N = 63) were randomized to an MCBI or an active control group (empathy diary). We assessed psychotherapists and their patients (N = 121) before and after the MCBI and at follow-up evaluation. Psychotherapists' results showed an increase in psychotherapeutic mindfulness skills (PMS) after the MCBI and at follow-up, whereas self-reported empathy improved at follow-up. Patients' results showed an improvement in perceived empathy, therapeutic bond, and symptomatology after the MCBI. The improvements in symptomatology were maintained for somatization and anxiety at follow-up. According to the MSEM, the increase in PMS is related to an increase in patient-reported psychotherapists' empathy, which produces an improvement in therapeutic bond and their symptomatology. These results support the benefits of introducing MCBI in psychotherapists' training to improve the psychotherapy outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

        "title": "Designing Ruby: Protocol for a 2-Arm, Brief, Digital Randomized Controlled Trial for Internalized Weight Bias.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Weight bias internalization, also known as weight self-stigma, is a serious health concern for individuals with higher body weight. Weight bias internalization is associated with the greater avoidance of health care and health-promoting activities, disordered eating, social isolation, and weight gain. Elevated weight bias internalization has been associated with low self-compassion, yet few investigations have explored self-compassion as a potential mechanism for reducing internalized weight bias. OBJECTIVE: Ruby is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial that was designed to test the efficacy of a 4-week digital self-compassion intervention to reduce internalized weight bias compared with a wait-list control. METHODS: Adults with elevated internalized weight bias and a BMI of >30 kg/m(2) (N=80) were recruited. Ruby is a standalone digital trial that will be delivered entirely via a smartphone and will involve web-based data collection and text messages. The intervention content will include psychoeducation and daily mindfulness practices with a focus on self-compassion and body concerns. We will use intent-to-treat analyses to examine changes in weight bias internalization throughout time by treatment arm. The analyses will be conducted by using one-way analysis of covariance models and linear mixed models. RESULTS: The protocol was designed in May 2020 and approved in December 2020. Data collection is currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: Ruby will be the first digital standalone, self-compassion-based intervention designed to reduce internalized weight bias. Owing to its standalone digital delivery, Ruby may be a highly scalable treatment for internalized weight bias that can be delivered on its own or combined with other treatments. We expect Ruby to be accessible to many, as participants can access the digital intervention at times of the day that are the most convenient in their schedule and are not burdened by in-person time commitments, which can be a barrier for participants with competing demands on their time and resources. If efficacious, Ruby will be poised to expand a burgeoning body of literature related to psychological intervention in this area.

        "title": "Increasing autobiographical memory specificity: Using kindness meditation to impact features of memory retrieval.",
        "abstract": "Individuals with a history of depression have an increased risk for future episodes. This risk has been linked with impaired features of autobiographical memory retrieval that remain when depressive symptoms abate, including memory specificity, remoteness, valence, and vantage perspective. Rumination has been shown to influence these impairments and can be reduced via compassion training. We therefore investigated the effects of a self-compassion meditation on autobiographical memory retrieval in remitted depression. Baseline data were collected (n = 50) using an extended version of the Autobiographical Memory Test where participants with remitted depression retrieved specific memories from a remote time period (10 cues) and from any time period (10 cues). Valence and vantage perspective were rated. Participants were then randomly allocated to a self-compassion meditation or (control) colouring intervention group. Baseline measures were reassessed after four weeks of the intervention. Results revealed increased retrieval of specific memories in the self-compassion group in comparison to the colouring group, and an increase in positive and field memories across groups while no remoteness changes were observed. This self-compassion meditation demonstrated initial promise as an intervention to influence features of autobiographical memory retrieval in remitted depression. Improvements were shown in specificity, valence, and vantage perspective. Addressing these features with this type of intervention might reduce a cognitive vulnerability to depression and should be investigated in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Meditation practices purportedly help people develop focused and sustained attention, cultivate feelings of compassionate concern for self and others, and strengthen motivation to help others who are in need. We examined the impact of 3 months of intensive meditative training on emotional responses to scenes of human suffering. Sixty participants were assigned randomly to either a 3-month intensive meditation retreat or a wait-list control group. Training consisted of daily practice in techniques designed to improve attention and enhance compassionate regard for others. Participants viewed film scenes depicting human suffering at pre- and posttraining laboratory assessments, during which both facial and subjective measures of emotion were collected. At post-assessment, training group participants were more likely than controls to show facial displays of sadness. Trainees also showed fewer facial displays of rejection emotions (anger, contempt, disgust). The groups did not differ on the likelihood or frequency of showing these emotions prior to training. Self-reported sympathy--but not sadness or distress--predicted sad behavior and inversely predicted displays of rejection emotions in trainees only. These results suggest that intensive meditation training encourages emotional responses to suffering characterized by enhanced sympathetic concern for, and reduced aversion to, the suffering of others.",

        "abstract": "The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of a two-week self-compassion course on healthy self-regulation (personal growth self-efficacy and healthy impulse control) and unhealthy self-regulation (self-judgment and habitual negative self-directed thinking) in university students. We also examined the effects on self-compassion, anxiety and depression. Students (N = 158, 85% women, mean age = 25 years) were randomized to an intervention group and a waiting-list control group in a multi-baseline randomized control trial. Healthy self-control was measured by the Personal Growth Initiative Scale (PGIS) and the Self-Control Scale; unhealthy self-control was measured by the Non-judgement subscale from the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (reversed) and the Habit Index of Negative Thinking (HINT). Secondary outcomes were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-trait), the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). A 2 * 3 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed gains for the intervention-group in personal growth self-efficacy and healthy impulse-control and reductions in self-judgment and habitual negative self-directed thinking, as well as increases in self-compassion and reductions in anxiety and depression. After all participants had completed the course, the groups were combined and repeated measures ANOVAs showed that changes remained at six-month follow-up for personal growth self-efficacy, self-judgment and habitual negative self-directed thinking; as well as for self-compassion, anxiety and depression. Concluding, a short self-compassion course seems an effective method of increasing self-compassion and perceived control over one's life for university students, as well as increasing mental health.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a devastating disease that can lead to poststroke depression (PSD) and greatest impact on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Mindfulness meditation was viewed as one of the effective ways to reduce PSD in patients with cancer. The present study tried to investigate whether mindfulness meditation has potential benefits in PSD and QOL for sICH patients in China. METHODS: Two hundred and two patients in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, enrolled from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in a randomized controlled trial. After removing missing values, there were 67 in control group and 67 in intervention group. Patients in intervention group received 2-month mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and patients in control group received stress management education (ie, an active control). RESULTS: The results suggested that the significant differences of depression, trait mindfulness, social well-being, emotional well-being, and total score of QOL were found in intervention group from time 1 to time 2. Physical well-being and the score of NIH stroke scale experienced significant changes in both control group and intervention group over time. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based intervention has positive effects on sICH patients' depression, social well-being, and emotional well-being. However, the change of trait mindfulness over time could not explain these positive effects. Future studies could explore the mechanism of mindfulness-based intervention on sICH patients' depression and QOL and clarify the boundaries of the positive effects of mindfulness-based intervention.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Interparental conflict exposure places adolescents at risk for problems with stress and anxiety; existing prevention/intervention strategies focus on reducing interparental conflict. Mindfulness-based programmes may be a promising treatment strategy for this population, but studies have not yet tested whether they are effective in this high-conflict context. In addition, evidence suggests that extensions to traditional treatments, such as delivering components in daily life that are tailored to moments of need, can increase treatment efficacy, particularly when combined with in-person treatments and particularly for adolescents. However, there are no such extensions to mindfulness interventions available. The Moving 2 Mindful study aims to (1) develop an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) supplement to Learning to BREATHE (L2B), an evidence-based mindfulness intervention for adolescents; (2) refine the EMI programme and determine the best delivery plan; (3) examine the feasibility and acceptability of L2B Plus (L2B plus the developed supplement) and (4) examine the potential for L2B Plus to reduce stress and anxiety for adolescents from high-conflict homes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Moving 2 Mindful study proposes a mixed-methods approach to developing and refining a multimethod adaptive supplement to L2B. Feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness will be tested in a sample of 38 families, who will be randomly assigned to receive L2B Plus or an active health and wellness control condition and followed until 3 months postintervention. A range of psychosocial and physiological factors will be assessed at multiple time points. This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (ID NCT03869749; pre-results).

        "abstract": "School-based mindfulness trainings (SBMT) are a contemporary approach for intervening to promote students' social and emotional skills and well-being. Despite evidence from the larger field of evidence-based social and emotional learning programs demonstrating the importance of high-quality implementation, few studies have investigated factors impacting the implementation of SBMTs, particularly teacher-level influences. The present study addressed this issue by investigating whether teachers' stress, trust in their fellow teachers and principal, and expectations about the program at baseline predicted the quality of their implementation of a SBMT for students. In addition, we examined whether teachers' stress at baseline moderated the effect of training condition on implementation quality. Implementation quality was assessed via observations and teacher self-reports. Results from a sample of British secondary (middle-high) school educators (N = 81) indicated that teachers who felt more supported by their principals at baseline were later observed to implement the SBMT with greater quality, whereas teachers who had more positive expectations about the program felt more confident teaching the course in the future. Teachers' baseline stress moderated the effect of training condition on all measures of implementation quality; among teachers experiencing high stress at baseline, more intensive training led to higher quality implementation. Implications for practitioners and prevention researchers are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness has been applied in the United States and Europe to improve physical and psychological health; however, little is known about its feasibility and efficacy in a Brazilian population. Mindfulness may also be relevant in tackling obesity and eating disorders by decreasing binge eating episodes-partly responsible for weight regain for a large number of people-and increasing awareness of emotional and other triggers for overeating. The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and efficacy of two mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) addressing overweight and obesity in primary care patients: a general programme called Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and a targeted mindful eating protocol called Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare treatment as usual separately in primary care with both programmes (health promotion and mindful eating) added to treatment as usual. Two hundred forty adult women with overweight and obesity will be enrolled. The primary outcome will be an assessment of improvement in eating behaviour. Secondary outcomes will be (1) biochemical control; (2) anthropometric parameters, body composition, dietary intake and basal metabolism; and (3) levels of mindfulness, stress, depression, self-compassion and anxiety. At the end of each intervention, a focus group will be held to assess the programme's impact on the participants' lives, diet and health. A feasibility study on access to benefits from and importance of MBIs at primary care facilities will be conducted among primary care health care professionals and participants. Monthly maintenance sessions lasting at least 1 hour will be offered, according to each protocol, during the 3-month follow-up periods. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will result in more effective mindfulness-based interventions as a complementary treatment in primary care for people with overweight and obesity. If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of mindfulness programmes in this population, it will be possible to improve quality of life and health while optimising public resources and reaching a greater number of people. In addition, on the basis of the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing this intervention in primary care facilities, we expect to be able to suggest the intervention for incorporation into public policy.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the feasibility and initial efficacy of a 12-week group mindfulness-based intervention tailored for persons with social anxiety disorder (MBI-SAD). The intervention includes elements of the standard mindfulness-based stress reduction program, explicit training in self-compassion aimed at cultivating a more accepting and kinder stance toward oneself, and use of exposure procedures to help participants practice responding mindfully to internal experiences evoked by feared social situations. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to the MBI-SAD (n = 21) or a waitlist (WL) (n = 18) control group. Feasibility was assessed by the number of participants who completed at least 75% of the 12 weekly group sessions. Primary efficacy outcomes were clinician- and self-rated measures of social anxiety. Other outcomes included clinician ratings of illness severity and self-rated depression, social adjustment, mindfulness, and self-compassion. RESULTS: The MBI-SAD was acceptable and feasible, with 81% of participants attending at least 75% of sessions. The MBI-SAD fared better than WL in improving social anxiety symptom severity (p <= 0.0001), depression (p <= 0.05), and social adjustment (p <= 0.05). The intervention also enhanced self-compassion (p <= 0.05), and facets of mindfulness (observe and aware; p <= .05). MBI-SAD treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that an MBI that integrates explicit training in self-compassion and mindful exposure is a feasible and promising intervention for social anxiety disorder. The next step is to compare the MBI-SAD to the gold standard of cognitive-behavior therapy to determine equivalence or noninferiority and to explore mediators and moderators of treatment outcome.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epilepsy extends far beyond seizures; up to 80% of children with epilepsy (CWE) may have comorbid cognitive or mental health problems, and up to 50% of parents of CWE are at risk for major depression. Past research has also shown that family environment has a greater influence on children's and parents' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mental health than epilepsy-related factors. There is a pressing need for low-cost, innovative interventions to improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether an interactive online mindfulness-based intervention program, Making Mindfulness Matter (M3), can be feasibly implemented and whether it positively affects CWE's and parents' HRQOL and mental health (specifically, stress, behavioral, depressive, and anxiety symptoms). METHODS: This parallel RCT was planned to recruit 100 child-parent dyads to be randomized 1:1 to the 8-week intervention or waitlist control and followed over 20 weeks. The intervention, M3, will be delivered online and separately to parents and children (ages 4-10 years) in groups of 4-8 by non-clinician staff of a local community epilepsy agency. The intervention incorporates mindful awareness, social-emotional learning skills, and positive psychology. It is modeled after the validated school-based MindUP program and adapted for provision online and to include a parent component. DISCUSSION: This RCT will determine whether this online mindfulness-based intervention is feasible and effective for CWE and their parents. The proposed intervention may be an ideal vector to significantly improve HRQOL and mental health for CWE and their parents given its low cost and implementation by community epilepsy agencies.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors and their informal caregivers (family members, close friends) often experience significant impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), including disruptions in psychological, physical, social, and spiritual well-being both during and after primary cancer treatment. The purpose of this in-progress pilot trial is to determine acceptability and preliminary efficacy (as reflected by effect sizes) of CBCT(R) (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) compared with a cancer health education (CHE) attention control to improve the primary outcome of depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes of other HRQOL domains (e.g., anxiety, fatigue), biomarkers of inflammation and diurnal cortisol rhythm, and healthcare utilization-related outcomes in both cancer survivors and informal caregivers. METHODS: Forty dyads consisting of solid tumor survivors who have completed primary treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery) and their informal caregivers, with at least one dyad member with \u2265 mild depressive symptoms or anxiety, will be recruited from Tucson, Arizona, USA. Survivor-caregiver dyads will be randomized together to complete either CBCT or CHE. CBCT is a manualized, 8-week, group meditation-based intervention that starts with attention and mindfulness and builds to contemplative practices aimed at cultivating compassion to the self and others. The goal of CBCT is to challenge unexamined assumptions about feelings and behaviors, with a focus on generating spontaneous self-compassion and increased empathic responsiveness and compassion for others. CHE is an 8-week, manualized group intervention that provides cancer-specific education on various topics (e.g., cancer advocacy, survivorship wellness). Patient-reported HRQOL outcomes will be assessed before, immediately after (week 9), and 1 month after CBCT or CHE (week 13). At the same time points, stress-related biomarkers of inflammation (e.g., plasma interleukin-6) and saliva cortisol relevant for survivor and informal caregiver wellness and healthcare utilization will be measured. DISCUSSION: If CBCT shows acceptability, a larger trial will be warranted and appropriately powered to formally test the efficacy of this dyadic intervention. Interventions such as CBCT directed toward both survivors and caregivers may eventually fill a gap in supportive oncology care programs to improve HRQOL and healthcare utilization in both dyad members.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers experience higher levels of work-related stress and higher rates of sickness absence than workers in other sectors. Psychological approaches have potential in providing healthcare workers with the knowledge and skills to recognise stress and to manage stress effectively. The strongest evidence for effectiveness in reducing stress in the workplace is for stress-management courses based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). However, research examining effects of these interventions on sickness absence (an objective indicator of stress) and compassion for others (an indicator of patient care) is limited, as is research on brief CBT stress-management courses (which may be more widely accessible) and on MBIs adapted for workplace settings. METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol is for two randomised controlled trials with participant preference between the two trials and 1:1 allocation to intervention or wait-list within the preferred choice. The first trial is examining a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and the second trial an 8-session Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Life (MBCT-L) course, with both trials comparing intervention to wait-list. The primary outcome for both trials is stress post-intervention with secondary outcomes being sickness absence, compassion for others, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, wellbeing, work-related burnout, self-compassion, presenteeism, and mindfulness (MBCT-L only). Both trials aim to recruit 234 staff working in the National Health Service in the UK. DISCUSSION: This trial will examine whether a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and an 8-session MBCT-L course are effective at reducing healthcare staff stress and other mental health outcomes compared to wait-list, and, whether these interventions are effective at reducing sickness absence and presenteeism and at enhancing wellbeing, self-compassion, mindfulness and compassion for others. Findings will help inform approaches offered to reduce healthcare staff stress and other key variables. A note of caution is that individual-level approaches should only be part of the solution to reducing healthcare staff stress within a broader focus on organisational-level interventions and support.

        "title": "A mindfulness and compassion-based program applied to pregnant women and their partners to decrease depression symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of great change for women and their partners, often bringing substantial challenges and stress. Approximately 10%-20% of women suffer from mood disorders such as depression in the perinatal period. There are risks involved in using psychopharmacological interventions to treat perinatal depression. Mindfulness and compassion-based educational programs could be efficacious and cost-effective options for the prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of an adapted Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) program that includes compassion training for pregnant women in primary care (PC) settings in the Spanish National Health System to decrease perinatal depression. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. Participants will be pregnant women (n = 122) and their partners who wish to participate. They will be enrolled and assessed in PC settings and randomly assigned to either: (1) an adapted MBCP educational program tailored to the Spanish National Health System + treatment as usual (TAU); or (2) TAU only. The main outcome to be assessed will be depression, evaluated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Secondary outcomes will include self-reported measures of perceived stress, affects, mindfulness, self-compassion, maternal self-efficacy, and use of health and social services. Patients will be assessed at four timepoints: baseline; post-treatment; and at three and six months after childbirth. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be carried out using linear regression mixed models. Effect sizes will be estimated using Cohen's d. DISCUSSION: Perinatal depression is a significant health problem. An effective and low-cost childbirth education program that incorporates mindfulness and compassion practices may be a beneficial preventive complementary healthcare modality for expectant women and their partners. This study will be the first multicenter RCT in Spanish PC settings using adapted MBCP and compassion practices to reduce symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a medically unexplained condition characterized by symptoms from multiple organ systems following the perception of common odorants. The condition can cause severe functional impairment for afflicted individuals. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for individuals with MCS. METHODS: The intention-to-treat sample (ITT) included 69 individuals who had been randomized to either MBCT or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome measure was the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI), which measures the following aspects of MCS: impact of MCS on daily life, symptoms, and reactions following chemical exposures. Secondary outcome measures included the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) and the anxiety and depression subscales of the symptom checklist 92 (SCL-92). Participants were assessed at baseline and post treatment, and at follow-up periods of 6- and 12-months. RESULTS: We found no effect of MBCT on the primary outcome, nor did we find an effect on levels of depression or anxiety. We did, however, find positive changes in illness perceptions, which were sustained at 12-month follow-up. Dropout rates were low, suggesting MBCT was well received and regarded as an acceptable intervention by individuals with MCS. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that MBCT does not change overall illness status in individuals with MCS, but that MBCT positively changes emotional and cognitive representations. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.",

        "title": "Preliminary efficacy of a lovingkindness meditation intervention for patients undergoing biopsy and breast cancer surgery: A randomized controlled pilot study.",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite more women undergoing treatment for breast cancer and increased survival rates, many women suffer from anxiety and physical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue) surrounding diagnosis and surgery. Research investigating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for breast cancer patients during this period is limited. This randomized controlled pilot study examined the effect of a brief lovingkindness meditation intervention on these key outcomes. METHODS: Participants were 60 women who underwent core needle breast biopsy, received an abnormal biopsy result, and underwent breast surgery (White = 73.6%; African American = 22.6%; Asian American = 3.8%; Age M = 56). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions at breast biopsy: (1) lovingkindness meditation, (2) music, and (3) usual care. Assessments of anxiety, pain, fatigue, physiologic reactivity, and self-compassion occurred prior to patients' biopsy, following biopsy, 1 week after receipt of biopsy results, and 1 week following breast surgery. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling analyses demonstrated that lovingkindness meditation significantly improved pain (p = 0.02), self-compassion (p = 0.004), and heart rate (p = 0.02) over time compared to control conditions. There was a trend for anxiety (p = 0.05). Music significantly improved pain (p = 0.04) compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a lovingkindness meditation intervention for breast cancer patients during the diagnostic and surgical period. Improving psychological and physical well-being during this time frame has the potential to improve longer-term health outcomes during adjuvant treatment and survivorship. Interventions that cultivate positive adjustment during the diagnostic and surgical period of breast cancer are an important area of future research.",

        "title": "Trial Protocol: The use of mindfulness-based intervention for improving bracing compliance for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients: protocol for a randomised, controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most prevalent deforming orthopaedic condition; it causes significant disability when spinal curves progress beyond 45deg. Bracing is the primary treatment prescribed for adolescents with an immature skeleton who have spinal curves between 25 and 45deg. New evidence suggests that compliance with bracing significantly decreases the progression of high-risk curves to the threshold for surgery. Nonetheless, bracing is a stressful experience. Therefore, interventions that mediate health-related quality of life for AIS patients are of great interest. In the past few decades, numerous studies have documented the benefits of mindfulness training on chronic pain, stress management, anxiety and emotional disorders. Mindfulness might additionally provide AIS patients with psychosocial support. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: This study will investigate the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on bracing compliance and quality of life among AIS patients with poor bracing compliance. The study also plans to evaluate if the mindfulness-based intervention effect is sustained after the intervention period. The potential mechanism by which mindfulness affects bracing compliance will be explored. DESIGN: Single-blind, two-arm, randomised, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study will recruit 120 AIS patients aged between 10 and 15 years with non-satisfactory bracing compliance. Patients who have previously practised or are currently practising meditation or mindful yoga or who cannot finish the whole intervention will be excluded. The study will take place at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care building. INTERVENTION: Patients in the mindfulness-based intervention group will join weekly sessions for 8 weeks. This program is a short version of a mindfulness-based stress relaxation program to address the specific issues of AIS patients. Two to three experienced instructors will deliver the program. CONTROL: Control group patients will participate in an 8-week physiotherapy exercise program as recommended in the International Scientific Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) 2011 guideline. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is the 6-month post-intervention total score of bracing compliance. Secondary measures are non-bracing-specific quality of life, bracing-specific quality of life, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindful awareness and acceptance, self-efficacy, perception of stress, and general measure of health outcome. PROCEDURE: 120 participants will be assigned to either an intervention or control arm by simple randomisation, and the randomisation result will only be revealed once participants have confirmed availability to attend intervention classes. Clinicians of the scoliosis clinic and research staff will be blinded to the treatment allocation. ANALYSIS: ANCOVA will be conducted to compare the effect of mindfulness-based intervention versus physiotherapy exercise on the outcome measures. To investigate significant change over time, linear mixed models analyses will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. The R-package lavaan will be used to conduct structural equation modelling to study the potential mechanism of mindfulness. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This will be the first psychosocial intervention study conducted on braced AIS patients with the aim of improving patients' bracing compliance and quality of life. The results from this study will potentially carry significant impact on future AIS treatment by emphasising psychosocial care for braced AIS patients.",

In a randomized controlled trial (N = 30), we explored whether individuals with higher levels of pretreatment trait mindfulness would benefit more from MBSR intervention. Results demonstrated that relative to a control condition (n = 15), MBSR treatment (n = 15) had significant effects on several outcomes, including increased trait mindfulness, subjective well-being, and empathy measured at 2 and 12 months after treatment. However, relative to controls, MBSR participants with higher levels of pretreatment mindfulness showed a larger increase in mindfulness, subjective well-being, empathy, and hope, and larger declines in perceived stress up to 1 year after treatment.",

        "abstract": "In this pre-registered study, we evaluated the effects of a single-session, self-guided intervention, leveraging daily micropractice (<=20 seconds/day practice) of self-compassionate touch to enhance self-compassion. We randomly assigned undergraduates (N = 135) to one of two conditions: a single-session intervention in which they were taught self-compassionate touch or a finger-tapping active control. Then, we instructed them to practice for 20 seconds/day for one month. At baseline (T1) and one-month follow-up (T2), participants completed assessments of self-compassion, growth mindset, positive affect, stress, psychopathology, habit formation, and more. In confirmatory, intention-to-treat analyses (N = 135), we found no significant effects on these outcomes. However, in confirmatory, per-protocol analyses (comparing the subsets from each condition who practiced>28 times, N = 45), self-compassionate touch, relative to active control, predicted T1-to-T2 increases in self-compassion (beta = 0.71, p = .025), and reductions in stress (beta = -0.62, p = .047) and psychopathology (beta = -0.61, p = .046). In exploratory intention-to-treat analyses (N = 135), we found the same pattern of effects as in the per-protocol analyses among those who practiced self-compassionate touch more frequently relative to active control. We discuss factors associated with habit formation of daily practice. Daily micropractices have the potential for augmenting single-session interventions and for offering help when more time-intensive approaches may be less accessible.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program for decreasing stress and anxiety and improving resilience and quality of life among Department of Radiology physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 26 Department of Radiology physicians were randomized in a single-blind trial to either the SMART program or a wait-list control arm for 12 weeks. The program involved a single 90-min group session in the SMART training with two follow-up phone calls. Primary outcomes measured at baseline and week 12 included the Perceived Stress Scale, Linear Analog Self-Assessment Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. RESULTS: A total of 22 physicians completed the study. A statistically significant improvement in perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and mindfulness at 12 weeks was observed in the study arm compared to the wait-list control arm; resilience also improved in the active arm, but the changes were not statistically significant when compared to the control arm. CONCLUSIONS: A single session to decrease stress among radiologists using the SMART program is feasible. Furthermore, the intervention afforded statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in anxiety, stress, quality of life, and mindful attention.

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disabling syndrome characterized by chronic pain associated with fatigue. Its pathogenesis is unknown, but alterations in central sensitization, involving an imbalance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory biomarkers, appear to be implicated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of attachment-based compassion therapy (ABCT) on levels of BDNF, the inflammatory markers TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and the C-reactive protein (CRP), analysing whether biomarkers play a mediating/moderating role in improvements in FM functional status. Thirty-four female patients with FM participated in a RCT and were assigned to ABCT or relaxation therapy. Blood extractions were conducted at baseline and post-intervention, with self-report assessments of functional status (FIQ) at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. A pro-inflammatory composite was obtained by summing up IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and CRP normalized values. Non-parametric tests, analysis of variance and regression models were used to evaluate treatment and mediation/moderation. Compared to relaxation therapy, ABCT showed significant improvements in FIQ and decreases in BDNF, CRP, and pro-inflammatory composite. Changes in BDNF had a mediating role in FIQ. ABCT seems to reduce BDNF and appears to have anti-inflammatory effects in FM patients. Reductions in BDNF could be a mechanism of FM functional status improvement.Clinical Trial Registration: http://ClinicalTrials.gov , identifier NCT02454244. Date: May 27th, 2015.",

Risk and protective factors, assessed at baseline, 5 and 10 weeks, included body dissatisfaction, negative affect, loneliness, self-compassion, positive affect, and mindfulness. Mixed models controlling for baseline levels of outcome variables were run. On average, participants attended 20 out of 30 yoga classes, and the majority of participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the yoga series. Appearance orientation decreased and positive affect increased in the yoga group relative to the control group. After controlling for baseline levels, the yoga group had a significantly higher positive affect than the control group. Changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant, as compared to the control condition. Future yoga research directions are discussed including education about body image, measure and sample selection, and use of an implementation science framework.",

The mindfulness-based empowerment program has been found to enhance self-compassion, self-esteem and coping levels in women who have experienced violence. Therefore, it is recommended to promote the widespread adoption of mindfulness-based interventions for individuals who have undergone trauma, such as violence, to facilitate their re-empowerment and functional recovery.

        "abstract": "Despite growing evidence in support of mindfulness as an underlying mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), it has been suggested that nonspecific therapeutic factors, such as the experience of social support, may contribute to the positive effects of MBIs. In the present study, we examined whether change in mindfulness and/or social support mediated the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) compared to another active intervention (i.e. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy (SET)), on change in mood disturbance, stress symptoms and quality of life. A secondary analysis was conducted of a multi-site randomized clinical trial investigating the impacts of MBCR and SET on distressed breast cancer survivors (MINDSET). We applied the causal steps approach with bootstrapping to test mediation, using pre- and post-intervention questionnaire data of the participants who were randomised to MBCR (n = 69) or SET (n = 70). MBCR participants improved significantly more on mood disturbance, stress symptoms and social support, but not on quality of life or mindfulness, compared to SET participants. Increased social support partially mediated the impact of MBCR versus SET on mood disturbance and stress symptoms. Because no group differences on mindfulness and quality of life were observed, no mediation analyses were performed on these variables. Findings showed that increased social support was related to more improvement in mood and stress after MBCR compared to support groups, whereas changes in mindfulness were not. This suggests a more important role for social support in enhancing outcomes in MBCR than previously thought.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate possible statistical mediators in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on pain intensity in women treated for primary breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 129 women treated for breast cancer, presenting with persistent pain, who were randomly assigned to MBCT or a wait-list control. We previously reported a statistically significant and robust effect of MBCT on pain intensity (11-point numeric rating scale), which was included as the primary outcome. The proposed mediators were mindfulness (the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), self-compassion (the Short-Form Self-Compassion Scale), and pain catastrophizing (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale). Measurement points included baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 3- (T3) and 6-month (T4) follow-ups. All indirect effects of the mediators were tested in separate Multilevel Models, using the product-of-coefficients approach with bias-corrected confidence intervals (95% BSCI). The statistically significant mediators were then included in a multiple mediator model. RESULTS: Statistically significant indirect effects were found for mindfulness nonreactivity (B=-0.17, BSCI [-0.32 to -0.04]) and pain catastrophizing (B=-0.76, BSCI [-1.25 to -0.47]). No statistically significant indirect effect was found for self-compassion (B=-0.09, BSCI [-0.30 to 0.04]). In a multiple mediator model, including mindfulness nonreactivity and pain catastrophizing, only pain catastrophizing remained statistically significant (B=-0.72, BSCI [-1.19 to -0.33]), explaining 78% of the effect. DISCUSSION: The results of the present study may have clinical implications. An increased focus on the proposed mediators may optimize the clinical use of MBCT for persistent pain in women treated for breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) increases momentary positive emotions and the ability to make use of natural rewards in daily life. METHOD: Adults with a life-time history of depression and current residual depressive symptoms (mean age = 43.9 years, SD = 9.6; 75% female; all Caucasian) were randomized to MBCT (n = 64) or waitlist control (CONTROL; n = 66) in a parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The Experience Sampling Method was used to measure momentary positive emotions as well as appraisal of pleasant activities in daily life during 6 days before and after the intervention. Residual depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960). RESULTS: MBCT compared to CONTROL was associated with significant increases in appraisals of positive emotion (b* = .39) and activity pleasantness (b* = .22) as well as enhanced ability to boost momentary positive emotions by engaging in pleasant activities (b* = .08; all ps < .005). Associations remained significant when corrected for reductions in depressive symptoms or for reductions in negative emotion, rumination, and worry. In the MBCT condition, increases in positive emotion variables were associated with reduction of residual depressive symptoms (all ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS: MBCT is associated with increased experience of momentary positive emotions as well as greater appreciation of, and enhanced responsiveness to, pleasant daily-life activities. These changes were unlikely to be pure epiphenomena of decreased depression and, given the role of positive emotions in resilience against depression, may contribute to the protective effects of MBCT against depressive relapse.",

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one nontraditional treatment that has demonstrated efficacy in treating other mood and anxiety disorders, and preliminary data suggest its efficacy in SAD as well. METHOD: Fifty-six adults (52% female; 41% Caucasian; age mean [M] \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]: 32.8 \u00b1 8.4) with SAD were randomized to MBSR or an active comparison condition, aerobic exercise (AE). At baseline and post-intervention, participants completed measures of clinical symptoms (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Perceived Stress Scale) and subjective well-being (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, and UCLA-8 Loneliness Scale). At 3 months post-intervention, a subset of these measures was readministered. For clinical significance analyses, 48 healthy adults (52.1% female; 56.3% Caucasian; age [M \u00b1 SD]: 33.9 \u00b1 9.8) were recruited. MBSR and AE participants were also compared with a separate untreated group of 29 adults (44.8% female; 48.3% Caucasian; age [M \u00b1 SD]: 32.3 \u00b1 9.4) with generalized SAD who completed assessments over a comparable time period with no intervening treatment. RESULTS: A 2 (Group) x 2 (Time) repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on measures of clinical symptoms and well-being were conducted to examine pre-intervention to post-intervention and pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. Both MBSR and AE were associated with reductions in social anxiety and depression and increases in subjective well-being, both immediately post-intervention and at 3 months post-intervention. When participants in the randomized controlled trial were compared with the untreated SAD group, participants in both interventions exhibited improvements on measures of clinical symptoms and well-being. CONCLUSION: Nontraditional interventions such as MBSR and AE merit further exploration as alternative or complementary treatments for SAD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis has a great impact on psychological functioning of patients and can be associated with various mental health disorders and symptoms. The most prevalent one is depression, which ranges from 15 to 47%. Mindfulness Based Interventions are a relatively brief and cost-effective program that has been studied in patients with several chronic diseases and recently also in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Mindfulness Based Interventions are based on the assumption that a non-judgmental awareness and acceptance of one's moment-to-moment experience can have a positive effect on the adaptation to the disease, reducing the psychological burden and improving patients' quality of life. Several studies concluded that Mindfulness Based Interventions can be beneficial in terms of improving both psychological and psychical aspects of Multiple Sclerosis, but none of them compared the intervention with an active control group. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a group-based Mindfulness Based Intervention on depressive symptoms in patients with Multiple Sclerosis, as compared with an active control group. METHODS: The study design is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Eighty-eight patients with Multiple Sclerosis and depressive symptoms will be recruited and randomized to either Mindfulness Based Intervention or an active control group. The latter is designed to control for non-specific elements of the intervention and it comprises psycho-education and relaxation techniques. The primary outcome is the reduction of depressive symptoms as measured via the Beck Depressive Inventory-II. Secondary outcome measures are level of quality of life, anxiety, perceived stress, illness perception, fatigue and quality of interpersonal relationship. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, after treatment and 6 months after the end of the treatment. Caregivers will participate in groups together with patients. DISCUSSION: As far as we know this trial will be the first randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of group-based Mindfulness Based Intervention for patients with Multiple Sclerosis with a comparison with an active control group with a specific focus on depressive symptoms.

        "title": "Intervention for the Management of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms to Reduce Caregiver Stress: Protocol for the Mindful and Self-Compassion Care Intervention for Caregivers of Persons Living With Dementia.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress related to Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) is common, particularly among those who care for persons with challenging behaviors and personality or mood changes. Mindfulness and self-compassion programs are efficacious for managing stress. The skills of mindfulness and self-compassion, however, must be integrated with behavioral management skills in order to effectively improve caregiver stress. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to describe the development of the Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care (MASC) program, the first program that combines mindfulness and self-compassion with behavioral management skills to decrease caregiver stress, and its evaluation in the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD Learning (SOCIAL) study. METHODS: Using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stage model, we describe 3 phases of work encompassing NIH Stages 1A and 1B. In phase 1, we conducted 5 focus groups (N=28) of stressed individuals caring for persons with ADRD and challenging behaviors. Rapid data analysis informed the development of a 6-week online intervention. Phase 2 (NIH stage 1A) includes an open pilot (N>10) with optional exit interviews. Phase 3 (NIH stage 1B) is a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the intervention versus the Health Education Program control. Primary outcomes focus on feasibility with secondary outcomes encompassing acceptability, credibility, fidelity, and signals of preliminary efficacy. Phase 1 follows traditional recommendations for qualitative analyses (at the point of thematic saturation) which was achieved after 5 focus groups (N=28). For the phase 2 open pilot, up to 12 participants will be recruited. For the phase 3 feasibility study, recruitment of 80 caregivers will allow the assessment of feasibility benchmarks. Data for phase 1 included 5 focus groups. In phases 2 and 3, data collection will occur through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) surveys and an optional qualitative exit interview. Analyses will include hybrid inductive-deductive analyses for qualitative data and assessment of changes in our intervention targets and outcomes using t tests and correlation analyses. RESULTS: In phase 1, caregivers reported interest in a brief, online stress management program. Participants held misconceptions about mindfulness and self-compassion, but after detailed explanation thoughts, these skills could be helpful when directly linked to implementation during caregiving routines. Phases 2 and 3 will be completed by the end of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the protocol for the Supporting Our Caregivers in ADRD Learning study, as well as the development and feasibility testing of the Mindful and Self-Compassionate Care intervention. Future work will include a fully powered efficacy-effectiveness randomized controlled trial.

        "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effect of Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living (MBCL) training given to the informal caregivers of palliative patients on burnout and caregiving burden. A single-blind, randomized, controlled, experimental study was conducted with 54 caregivers of patients admitted to a hospital palliative care unit. The participants were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n = 26) and control group (n = 28). The experimental group received MBCL training twice a week for 4 weeks. Data were collected before and after the intervention using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Caregiver Burden Scale and Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. The data were analyzed using kurtosis and skewness coefficients, number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, chi-square test, independent samples t test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS version 22.0. The informal caregivers in the experimental group demonstrated a significant decrease in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores and an increase in personal accomplishment and self-compassion scores in posttest assessments after the MBCL intervention (P < 0.05). All of these parameters differed significantly between the experimental and control groups after the intervention (P < 0.05). MBCL training seems to be effective in reducing emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and increasing personal accomplishment and self-compassion among informal caregivers of palliative inpatients. The results of this study can be generalized to the caretakers of patients receiving palliative care in university hospitals.",

        "title": "Prevention of internalizing difficulties in the middle years: Protocol for a noninferiority randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.",
        "abstract": "AIM: Mindfulness-based interventions have been tested as preventive programs for childhood internalizing difficulties, but most research has been at a 'universal' level with small to null effects. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) has similar effects to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) when used as a small-group, targeted preventive program. Knowledge gaps include the longer-term effectiveness of MBCT-C relative to CBT and the benefits of adding a parent module. This trial aims to compare MCBT-C to traditional CBT, including a parent module, to 15-months post-intervention and to test the feasibility and acceptability of adding a parent module. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from primary schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in South Australia (n = 194). Children (aged 9-12) years with signs of internalizing difficulties (e.g., shy, withdrawn, worried), and their parents, will be eligible for this two-armed randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (RCT). Children will participate in 10 group sessions of MBCT-C or CBT, facilitated by psychologists, and parents from both conditions will participate in two parent-only group sessions. Child self-report measures include depression and anxiety, as well as attention, mindfulness and self-compassion. Parent measures include symptoms of depression and anxiety, mindfulness, and parent-child relationship strength. The primary outcome will be child anxiety and depression (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-25). Measures will be collected pre and post intervention, and at 3, 6, 12 and 15-month follow up. RESULTS: Schools will be recruited from October 2022. Nomination of children will commence from February 2023. Program implementation will begin May 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will have implications for the feasibility of involving parents in preventative programs, as well as whether mindfulness-based interventions prevent internalizing difficulties over time.",

        "title": "Understanding mechanisms of depression prevention: study protocol of a randomized cross-over trial to investigate mechanisms of mindfulness and positive fantasizing as intervention techniques for reducing perseverative cognition in remitted depressed individuals.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and involves high relapse rates in which persistent negative thinking and rumination (i.e., perseverative cognition [PC]) play an important role. Positive fantasizing and mindfulness are common evidence-based psychological interventions that have been shown to effectively reduce PC and subsequent depressive relapse. How the interventions cause changes in PC over time, is unknown, but likely differ between the two. Whereas fantasizing may change the valence of thought content, mindfulness may operate through disengaging from automatic thought patterns. Comparing mechanisms of both interventions in a clinical sample and a non-clinical sample can give insight into the effectivity of interventions for different individuals. The current study aims to 1) test whether momentary psychological and psychophysiological indices of PC are differentially affected by positive fantasizing versus mindfulness-based interventions, 2) test whether the mechanisms of change by which fantasizing and mindfulness affect PC differ between remitted MDD versus never-depressed (ND) individuals, and 3) explore potential moderators of the main effects of the two interventions (i.e., what works for whom). METHODS: In this cross-over trial of fantasizing versus mindfulness interventions, we will include 50 remitted MDD and 50 ND individuals. Before the start of the measurements, participants complete several individual characteristics. Daily-life diary measures of thoughts and feelings (using an experience sampling method), behavioural measures of spontaneous thoughts (using the Sustained Attention to Response Task), actigraphy, physiological measures (impedance cardiography, electrocardiography, and electroencephalogram), and measures of depressive mood (self-report questionnaires) are performed during the week before (pre-) the interventions and the week during (peri-) the interventions. After a wash-out of at least one month, pre- and peri-intervention measures for the second intervention are repeated. DISCUSSION: This is the first study integrating self-reports, behavioural-, and physiological measures capturing dynamics at multiple time scales to examine the differential mechanisms of change in PC by psychological interventions in individuals remitted from multiple MDD episodes and ND individuals. Unravelling how therapeutic techniques affect PC in remitted individuals might generate insights that allows development of personalised targeted relapse prevention interventions.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a specialized yoga program for individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) on pain, psychological, and mindfulness variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants with SCI (n=23) were outpatients or community members affiliated with a rehabilitation hospital. Participants were randomized to an Iyengar yoga (IY; n=11) group or to a 6-week wait-list control (WLC; n=12) group. The IY group participated in a twice-weekly 6-week seated IY program; the WLC group participated in the same yoga program, after the IY group's yoga program had ended. Pain, psychological, and mindfulness measures were collected at two time points for both groups (within 1-2 weeks before and after program 1 and at a third time point for the WLC group (within 1 week after program 2). RESULTS: Linear mixed-effect growth models were conducted to evaluate the main effects of group at T2 (postintervention), controlling for T1 (preintervention) scores. T2 depression scores were lower (F(1,18)=6.1, P<0.05) and T2 self-compassion scores higher (F(1,18)=6.57, P< 0.05) in the IY group compared to the WLC group. To increase sample size and power, the two groups were combined and analyzed across time by comparing pre- and postintervention scores. Main effects of time were found for depression scores, (F(1,14.83)=6.62, P<0.05), self-compassion, (F(1,16.6)=4.49, P<0.05), mindfulness (F(1,16.79)=5.42, P<0.05), mindful observing (F(1,19.82)=5.06, P<0.05), and mindful nonreactivity, (F(1,16.53)=4.92, P<0.05), all showing improvement after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The results indicated that a specialized 6-week yoga intervention reduced depressive symptoms and increased self-compassion in individuals with SCI, and may also have fostered greater mindfulness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calm, compassionate clinicians comfort others. To evaluate the direct psychophysiologic benefits of non-verbal communication of compassion (NVCC), it is important to minimize the effect of subjects' expectation. This preliminary study was designed to a) test the feasibility of two strategies for maintaining subject blinding to non-verbal communication of compassion (NVCC), and b) determine whether blinded subjects would experience psychophysiologic effects from NVCC. METHODS: Subjects were healthy volunteers who were told the study was evaluating the effect of time and touch on the autonomic nervous system. The practitioner had more than 10 years' experience with loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a form of NVCC. Subjects completed 10-point visual analog scales (VAS) for stress, relaxation, and peacefulness before and after LKM. To assess physiologic effects, practitioners and subjects wore cardiorespiratory monitors to assess respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout the 4 10-minute study periods: Baseline (both practitioner and subjects read neutral material); non-tactile-LKM (subjects read while the practitioner practiced LKM while pretending to read); tactile-LKM (subjects rested while the practitioner practiced LKM while lightly touching the subject on arms, shoulders, hands, feet, and legs); Post-Intervention Rest (subjects rested; the practitioner read). To assess blinding, subjects were asked after the interventions what the practitioner was doing during each period (reading, touch, or something else). RESULTS: Subjects' mean age was 43.6 years; all were women. Blinding was maintained and the practitioner was able to maintain meditation for both tactile and non-tactile LKM interventions as reflected in significantly reduced RR. Despite blinding, subjects' VAS scores improved from baseline to post-intervention for stress (5.5 vs. 2.2), relaxation (3.8 vs. 8.8) and peacefulness (3.8 vs. 9.0, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Subjects also had significant reductions in RR (P < 0.0001) and improved HRV (P < 0.05) with both tactile and non-tactile LKM. CONCLUSION: It is possible to test the effects of LKM with tactile and non-tactile blinding strategies; even with blinding in this small preliminary study, subjects reported significant improvements in well-being which were reflected in objective physiologic measures of autonomic activity. Extending compassion is not only good care; it may also be good medicine. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: US National ClinicalTrials.gov registration number, NCT01428674.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer patients report among the highest distress rates of all cancer patients. Partners report similar distress rates. The present study examined the effectiveness of additional mindfulness-based stress reduction (care as usual [CAU] + MBSR) versus solely CAU to reduce psychological distress in lung cancer patients and/or their partners. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. Mindfulness-based stress reduction is an 8-week group-based intervention, including mindfulness practice and teachings on stress. Care as usual included anticancer treatment, medical consultations, and supportive care. The primary outcome was psychological distress. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, caregiver burden, relationship satisfaction, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, rumination, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Linear mixed modeling was conducted on an intention-to-treat sample. Moderation (gender, disease stage, baseline distress, participation with/without partner) and mediation analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients and 21 partners were randomized to CAU + MBSR and 32 patients and 23 partners to CAU. After CAU + MBSR patients reported significantly less psychological distress (p = .008, d = .69) than after CAU. Baseline distress moderated outcome: those with more distress benefitted most from MBSR. Additionally, after CAU + MBSR patients showed more improvements in quality of life, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and rumination than after CAU. In partners, no differences were found between groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that psychological distress in lung cancer patients can be effectively treated with MBSR. No effect was found in partners, possibly because they were more focused on patients' well-being rather than their own.",

        "abstract": "Job-related burnout is one health outcome in nurses working in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) due to the heavy workload, which results in negative physical and psychological consequences. One newly introduced approach to improve coping is loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Some studies have shown the effectiveness of the LKM on the mental health of nurses, though more evidence is required to support them. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the LKM on job-related burnout of nurses working in NICU. This clustered controlled randomized clinical trial assessed job-related burnout before and after a month of practicing LKM guided through a virtual method. A total of 66 eligible NICU nurses from 2 referral children hospitals in Tehran were randomly assigned to 2 control (n = 33) and intervention (n = 33) groups. The intervention was performed 3 times a week for 1 month in the form of 20-minute audio files of LKM for the intervention group, and educational files on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic were sent to the control group. The instruments used in this study were the demographic information questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which participants completed before and after the intervention. The mean difference in the overall scores of burnout before and after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly reduced (P = .003), but no significant difference was observed in the control group (P = .018). These findings support the benefit of LKM in NICU nurses in reducing burnout.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The utility of brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) to improve empathy and theory-of-mind has been underinvestigated, particularly in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to examine the efficacy of a 14-day, fully self-guided, mindfulness EMI on the empathy and theory-of-mind domains for GAD. METHODS: Adults (aged \u226518 y) diagnosed with GAD were randomized to a mindfulness EMI (68/110, 61.8%) or self-monitoring app (42/110, 38.2%) arm. They completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report empathy measure and theory-of-mind test (Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task) at prerandomization, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU) time points. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted with the intent-to-treat principle to determine prerandomization to postintervention (pre-post intervention) and prerandomization to 1MFU (pre-1MFU) changes, comparing the mindfulness EMI to self-monitoring. RESULTS: Observed effects were generally stronger from pre-1MFU than from pre-post intervention time points. From pre-post intervention time points, the mindfulness EMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app on fantasy (the ability to imagine being in others' shoes; between-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.26, P=.007; within-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.22, P=.02 for the mindfulness EMI and Cohen d=-0.16, P=.10 for the self-monitoring app). From pre-1MFU time points, the mindfulness EMI, but not the self-monitoring app, improved theory-of-mind (a window into others' thoughts and intentions through abstract, propositional knowledge about their mental states, encompassing the ability to decipher social cues) and the fantasy, personal distress (stress when witnessing others' negative experiences), and perspective-taking (understanding others' perspective) empathy domains. The effect sizes were small to moderate (Cohen d=0.15-0.36; P<.001 to P=.01) for significant between-intervention effects from pre-1MFU time points. Furthermore, the within-intervention effect sizes for these significant outcomes were stronger for the mindfulness EMI (Cohen d=0.30-0.43; P<.001 to P=.03) than the self-monitoring app (Cohen d=-0.12 to 0.21; P=.001 to P>.99) from pre-1MFU time points. No between-intervention and within-intervention effects on empathic concern (feeling affection, compassion, and care when observing others in distress, primarily attending to their emotional well-being) were observed from pre-post intervention and pre-1MFU time points. CONCLUSIONS: The brief mindfulness EMI improved specific domains of empathy (eg, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective-taking) and theory-of-mind with small to moderate effect sizes in persons with GAD. Higher-intensity, self-guided or coach-facilitated, multicomponent mindfulness EMIs targeting the optimization of social relationships are likely necessary to improve the empathic concern domain in this population.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The academic development and widespread adoption of meditation practices for well-being and therapy have predominantly focused on secularised adaptations of Buddhist and Hindu techniques. This study aims to expand the field by investigating Christian and Islamic meditation that emphasize the spiritual significance of the heart through elements of visualisation and recitation. It compares the effects of spiritual heart-centred meditation with mindfulness meditation and a waitlist control, focusing on dimensions of social functioning, psychophysiology, cognition, and mental health. METHOD: This study employs a stratified 3-arm randomised controlled method with mixed-method repeated measures across three assessment time points: before intervention (T1), after an 8-week intervention (T2), and at a 3-month follow up (T3). The three conditions include spiritual meditation (either Christian or Islamic), mindfulness meditation (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction - MBSR), and a waitlist. Participants will be stratified into Christian and Muslim samples and randomly allocated to the spiritual meditation, MBSR, or waitlist control conditions. Importantly, participants assigned to the spiritual meditation condition will be matched to the spiritual meditation program corresponding to their religion. The intervention will be administered through a mobile phone app with daily 20-minute guided meditation sessions for eight weeks. Primary outcomes pertain to the domain of interpersonal functioning, focusing on prosociality, forgiveness, empathy, and perspective taking. Secondary outcomes include physiology: pain tolerance, pain intensity, stress reactivity assessed via heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), psychophysiological reactivity associated with a forgiveness task as measured through HR and HRV, attention (alerting, orienting, and executive attention networks), and mental health (stress, depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, positive and negative affect). DISCUSSION: This trial aims to test the effects of an app-based Christian and Islamic meditation, compared to secular mindfulness and a waitlist, using a randomised controlled trial. If the results yield positive outcomes, this study will support the efficacy of these contemplations, offering practitioners a way to enhance their well-being within their religious framework.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Depression is associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer survivors (BCSs), with higher prevalence among younger women. The Pathways to Wellness (PTW; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139) randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated beneficial effects of two behavioral interventions (survivorship education [SE] and mindful awareness practices [MAPs]) on depressive symptoms in younger BCS. We conducted an exploratory secondary analysis to identify moderators of intervention effects. METHODS: Women diagnosed with stage 0 to III breast cancer at or before age 50 years who completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of SE (n = 81), MAPs (n = 85), or waitlist control (WLC; n = 81). Moderators assessed at baseline included psychological distress (depression and anxiety), intervention preference, preparedness for survivorship, and time since initial diagnosis. Linear regression models tested the modifying effects of each variable on postintervention depression in SE versus WLC and MAPs versus WLC. RESULTS: Baseline levels of depression (beta = -.03, P < .01) and anxiety (beta = -.64, P = .02) moderated effects of SE on depressive symptoms, as did preparedness for survivorship (beta = 3.17, P = .02). Participants randomly assigned to SE who had the highest levels of depression or anxiety and who felt least prepared for survivorship showed the largest reductions in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention. Similar effects were not observed for MAPs. Intervention preference and time since diagnosis did not moderate intervention effects for either SE or MAPs. CONCLUSION: Our 6-week, group-based SE program may be most beneficial for women with higher levels of psychological distress and those who feel least prepared for cancer survivorship. By contrast, a 6-week mindfulness awareness practice intervention appears to benefit younger BCS regardless of pretreatment characteristics.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The current study builds on the expertise of National Gallery Singapore and Nanyang Technological University Singapore (NTU) in developing and piloting an enhanced version of the Slow Art program, namely \"Slow Art Plus\" for mental health promotion. METHODS: A single-site, open-label, waitlist Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design comprising of a treatment group and waitlist control group was adopted (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05803226). Participants (N = 196) completed three online questionnaires at three timepoints: baseline [T1], immediately post-intervention/s baseline [T2], post-intervention follow-up/immediately post-intervention [T3]. Qualitative focus groups were conducted to evaluate program acceptability. RESULTS: A mixed model ANOVA was performed to understand intervention effectiveness between the immediate intervention group and waitlist control group. The analyses revealed a significant interaction effect where intervention group participants reported an improvement in spiritual well-being (p = 0.001), describing their thoughts and experiences (p = 0.02), and nonreacting to inner experiences (p = 0.01) immediately after Slow Art Plus as compared to the control group. Additionally, one-way repeated measure ANOVAs were conducted for the intervention group to evaluate maintenance effects of the intervention. The analyses indicated significant improvements in perceived stress (p < 0.001), mindfulness (p < 0.001) as well as multiple mindfulness subscales, active engagement with the world (p = 0.003), and self-compassion (p = 0.02) 1 day after the completion of Slow Art Plus. Results from framework analysis of focus group data revealed a total of two themes (1: Experiences of Slow Art Plus, 2: Insights to Effective Implementation) and six subthemes (1a: Peaceful relaxation, 1b: Self-Compassion, 1c: Widened Perspective, 2a: Valuable Components, 2b: Execution Requisites, 2c: Suggested Enhancements), providing valuable insights to the overall experience and implementation of the intervention. DISCUSSION: Slow Art Plus represents a unique approach, offering a standardized, multimodal, single-session program that integrates mindfulness and self-compassion practices, as well as reflective and creative expressions with Southeast Asian art. It demonstrates potential in meeting the mental health needs of a wide range of individuals and could be readily incorporated into social prescribing initiatives for diverse populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies show that intense work schedules make health care professionals particularly vulnerable to emotional exhaustion and burnout. OBJECTIVE: In this scenario, promoting self-compassion and mindfulness may be beneficial for well-being. Notably, scalable, digital app-based methods may have the potential to enhance self-compassion and mindfulness in health care professionals. METHODS: In this study, we designed and implemented a scalable, digital app-based, brief mindfulness and compassion training program called \"WellMind\" for health care professionals. A total of 22 adult participants completed up to 60 sessions of WellMind training, 5-10 minutes in duration each, over 3 months. Participants completed behavioral assessments measuring self-compassion and mindfulness at baseline (preintervention), 3 months (postintervention), and 6 months (follow-up). In order to control for practice effects on the repeat assessments and calculate effect sizes, we also studied a no-contact control group of 21 health care professionals who only completed the repeated assessments but were not provided any training. Additionally, we evaluated pre- and postintervention neural activity in core brain networks using electroencephalography source imaging as an objective neurophysiological training outcome. RESULTS: Findings showed a post- versus preintervention increase in self-compassion (Cohen d=0.57; P=.007) and state-mindfulness (d=0.52; P=.02) only in the WellMind training group, with improvements in self-compassion sustained at follow-up (d=0.8; P=.01). Additionally, WellMind training durations correlated with the magnitude of improvement in self-compassion across human participants (\u03c1=0.52; P=.01). Training-related neurophysiological results revealed plasticity specific to the default mode network (DMN) that is implicated in mind-wandering and rumination, with DMN network suppression selectively observed at the postintervention time point in the WellMind group (d=-0.87; P=.03). We also found that improvement in self-compassion was directly related to the extent of DMN suppression (\u03c1=-0.368; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, promising behavioral and neurophysiological findings from this first study demonstrate the benefits of brief digital mindfulness and compassion training for health care professionals and compel the scale-up of the digital intervention.

        "title": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people with chronic fatigue syndrome still experiencing excessive fatigue after cognitive behaviour therapy: a pilot randomized study.",
        "abstract": "Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; sometimes known as myalgic encephalomyelitis). However, only a minority of patients fully recover after CBT; thus, methods for improving treatment outcomes are required. This pilot study concerned a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention adapted for people with CFS who were still experiencing excessive fatigue after CBT. The study aimed to investigate the acceptability of this new intervention and the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale randomized trial in the future. Preliminary efficacy analyses were also undertaken. Participants were randomly allocated to MBCT or waiting list. Sixteen MBCT participants and 19 waiting-list participants completed the study, with the intervention being delivered in two separate groups. Acceptability, engagement and participant-rated helpfulness of the intervention were high. Analysis of covariance controlling for pre-treatment scores indicated that, at post-treatment, MBCT participants reported lower levels of fatigue (the primary clinical outcome) than the waiting-list group. Similarly, there were significant group differences in fatigue at 2-month follow-up, and when the MBCT group was followed up to 6 months post-treatment, these improvements were maintained. The MBCT group also had superior outcomes on measures of impairment, depressed mood, catastrophic thinking about fatigue, all-or-nothing behavioural responses, unhelpful beliefs about emotions, mindfulness and self-compassion. In conclusion, MBCT is a promising and acceptable additional intervention for people still experiencing excessive fatigue after CBT for CFS, which should be investigated in a larger randomized controlled trial. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Only about 30% of people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) recover after cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT); thus, methods for improving treatment outcomes are needed. This is the first pilot randomized study to demonstrate that a mindfulness-based intervention was associated with reduced fatigue and other benefits for people with CFS who were still experiencing excessive fatigue after a course of CBT. Levels of acceptability, engagement in the intervention and rated helpfulness were high. A larger-scale randomized controlled trial is required.",

        "title": "Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention Program as an Adjunct to the Standard Treatment for Smoking: A Pragmatic Design Pilot Study.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Posttreatment relapse is a major roadblock to stemming the global epidemic of tobacco-related illness. This article presents results from a pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and initial efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) as an adjunct to standard relapse prevention treatment (ST) for smoking cessation. AIMS AND METHODS: Smokers (n = 86) in the maintenance phase of treatment were randomized to receive either ST plus MBRP (MBRP) (n = 44) or ST alone (ST) (n = 42). Data were collected at baseline and at 4-, 12-, and 24-week follow-up points. We evaluated the feasibility of the protocol with frequency analysis, and the efficacy with both intention to treat and complete case analyses of the effects of MBRP on abstinence. Secondary outcomes included mindfulness, craving, depression, anxiety, and positive/negative affect. RESULTS: High adherence suggested MBRP is acceptable and feasible. Participants in the MBRP group reported increases in mindfulness (M = -7.833, p = .016), and reductions in craving (M = 17.583, p = .01) compared with the ST group. Intention to treat analysis found that, compared with MBRP (36.4%), ST (57.1%) showed trend-level superiority in abstinence at Week 4 (Prevalence Ratio = 0.63, p = .06); however at Week 24, the ST group (14.3%) demonstrated a twofold greater decrease in abstinence, compared with the MBRP group (20.1%) (Prevalence Ratio = 2.25, p = .08). Therefore, the MBRP group maintained a higher abstinence rate for longer. Reported effects were greater in the complete case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MBRP holds promise for preventing relapse after aided tobacco quit attempts. IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest that MBRP is acceptable, feasible, and valued by participants. At 24-week follow-up, there was a large effect size and a statistical trend toward fewer MBRP patients relapsing compared with ST patients. MBRP conferred ancillary benefits including reductions in craving and increases in levels of mindfulness. MBRP for tobacco cessation is highly promising and merits further research.

        "title": "Testing the Efficacy of a Brief, Self-Guided Mindfulness Ecological Momentary Intervention on Emotion Regulation and Self-Compassion in Social Anxiety Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Theories propose that brief, mobile, self-guided mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) could enhance emotion regulation (ER) and self-compassion. Such changes are posited to be mechanisms of change. However, rigorous tests of these theories have not been conducted. OBJECTIVE: In this assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, we aimed to test these theories in social anxiety disorder (SAD). METHODS: Participants with SAD (defined as having a prerandomization cut-off score \u226520 on the Social Phobia Inventory self-report) were randomized to a 14-day fully self-guided MEMI (96/191, 50.3%) or self-monitoring app (95/191, 49.7%) arm. They completed web-based self-reports of 6 clinical outcome measures at prerandomization, 15-day postintervention (administered the day after the intervention ended), and 1-month follow-up time points. ER and self-compassion were assessed at preintervention and 7-day midintervention time points. Multilevel modeling determined the efficacy of MEMI on ER and self-compassion domains from pretrial to midintervention time points. Bootstrapped parallel multilevel mediation analysis examined the mediating role of pretrial to midintervention ER and self-compassion domains on the efficacy of MEMI on 6 clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated strong compliance, with 78% (149/191) engaging in at least 80% of the MEMI and self-monitoring prompts. MEMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app in decreasing ER goal-directed behavior difficulties (between-group Cohen d=-0.24) and lack of emotional clarity (Cohen d=0.16) and increasing self-compassion social connectedness (Cohen d=0.19), nonidentification with emotions (Cohen d=0.16), and self-kindness (Cohen d=0.19) from pretrial to midintervention time points. The within-group effect sizes from pretrial to midintervention were larger in the MEMI arm than in the self-monitoring app arm (ER goal-directed behavior difficulties: Cohen d=-0.73 vs -0.29, lack of emotional clarity: Cohen d=-0.39 vs -0.21, self-compassion domains of social connectedness: Cohen d=0.45 vs 0.19, nonidentification with emotions: Cohen d=0.63 vs 0.48, and self-kindness: Cohen d=0.36 vs 0.10). Self-monitoring, but not MEMI, alleviated ER emotional awareness issues (between-group Cohen d=0.11 and within-group: Cohen d=-0.29 vs -0.13) and reduced self-compassion acknowledging shared human struggles (between-group Cohen d=0.26 and within-group: Cohen d=-0.23 vs 0.13). No ER and self-compassion domains were mediators of the effect of MEMI on SAD symptoms (P=.07-<.99), generalized anxiety symptoms (P=.16-.98), depression severity (P=.20-.94), repetitive negative thinking (P=.12-.96), and trait mindfulness (P=.18-.99) from pretrial to postintervention time points. Similar nonsignificant mediation effects emerged for all of these clinical outcomes from pretrial to 1-month follow-up time points (P=.11-.98). CONCLUSIONS: Brief, fully self-guided, mobile MEMIs efficaciously increased specific self-compassion domains and decreased ER difficulties associated with goal pursuit and clarity of emotions from pretrial to midintervention time points. Higher-intensity MEMIs may be required to pinpoint the specific change mechanisms in ER and self-compassion domains of SAD.

        "title": "Time-out for well-being: A mixed methods evaluation of attitudes and likelihood to engage in different types of online emotional well-being programmes in the perinatal period.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Positive maternal mental health during the perinatal period contributes to general well-being and positive emotional bonds with the child, encouraging an optimal developmental trajectory. Online interventions to enhance maternal well-being and develop coping skills, such as meditation-based interventions, can be a low-cost way to improve mother and child outcomes. However, this depends on end-user engagement. To date, there is limited evidence about women's willingness to engage and preferences for online programmes. OBJECTIVES: This study explored pregnant women's attitudes towards and likelihood to undertake minimal online well-being training programmes (mindfulness, self-compassion, or general relaxation), engagement barriers and enablers, and programme structure preferences. DESIGN: A mixed methods triangulation design was undertaken using a validating quantitative model. Quantile regressions were applied to the quantitative data. Content analysis was undertaken for the qualitative data. METHODS: Consenting pregnant women (n = 151) were randomized equally to read about three online programme types. Participants were sent an information leaflet, tested by a consumer panel prior to distribution. RESULTS: Participants generally held positive attitudes about all three types of interventions, with no statistically significant differences in preferences between programme types. Participants appreciated the importance of mental health and were receptive to fostering skills to support their emotional well-being and stress management. The most frequent perceived barriers were lack of time, tiredness, and forgetfulness. Programme structure preferences indicated one to two modules per week, less than 15 min in duration, and over 4 weeks. Programme functionality, such as regular reminders and easy accessibility, is important to end users. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the importance of determining participant preferences in designing and communicating engaging interventions for perinatal women. This research contributes to the understanding of population-based interventions that can be provided as simple, scalable, cost-effective, and home-based activities in pregnancy for the benefit of individuals, their families, and society more broadly.",

        "title": "Cost-utility and biological underpinnings of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) versus a psychoeducational programme (FibroQoL) for fibromyalgia: a 12-month randomised controlled trial (EUDAIMON study).",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The EUDAIMON study focuses on fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a prevalent chronic condition characterized by pain, fatigue, cognitive problems and distress. According to recent reviews and meta-analyses, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a promising therapeutic approach for patients with FMS. The measurement of biomarkers as part of the analysis of MBSR effects would help to identify the neurobiological underpinnings of MBSR and increase our knowledge of FMS pathophysiology. The main objectives of this 12-month RCT are: firstly, to examine the effectiveness and cost-utility for FMS patients of MBSR as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU + the psychoeducational programme FibroQoL, and versus TAU only; secondly, to examine pre-post differences in brain structure and function, as well as levels of specific inflammatory markers in the three study arms and; thirdly, to analyse the role of some psychological variables as mediators of 12-month clinical outcomes. METHODS: Effectiveness, cost-utility, and neurobiological analyses performed alongside a 12-month RCT. The participants will be 180 adult patients with FMS recruited at the Sant Joan de Deu hospital (St. Boi de Llobregat, Spain), randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU + MBSR vs. TAU + FibroQol vs. TAU. A comprehensive assessment to collect functional, quality of life, distress, costs, and psychological variables will be conducted pre-, post-intervention, and at 12-month post-intervention. Fifty per cent of study participants will be evaluated at pre- and post-treatment using Voxel-Based Morphometry, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labeling, and resting state fMRI. A cytokine multiplex kit of high-sensitivity will be applied (cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 + high-sensitivity CRP test). DISCUSSION: The findings obtained from this RCT will indicate whether MBSR is potentially cost-effective for FMS and contribute to knowledge of any brain and inflammatory changes associated with MBSR in FMS patients. Specifically, we will determine whether there are morphometric and functional changes associated with participation in MBSR in brain regions related to meta-awareness, body awareness, memory consolidation-reconsolidation, emotion regulation and in networks postulated to underpin the sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative and affective-motivational aspects of the pain experience.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions have been increasingly applied to treat eating-related problems ranging from obesity to eating disorders. Yet few studies have empirically examined the mechanisms of a mindful approach to eating. The current studies examine the potential of brief mindfulness instructions to enhance the psychological and behavioral dimensions of eating. METHODS: In three experiments (total N = 319 undergraduates), we examined whether brief mindfulness instructions would enhance the positive sensory experience involved in tasting food as well as healthy eating behaviors. RESULTS: Relative to distraction control instructions, the first two studies demonstrated that brief mindfulness instructions increased the enjoyment of a commonly pleasurable food (chocolate; Study 1), and a food with generally more mixed associations (raisins; Study 2). The third study replicated and extended these findings to show that brief mindfulness instructions also led to lower calorie consumption of unhealthy food relative to distracted or no-instruction control conditions, an effect mediated by greater eating enjoyment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated the power of brief mindfulness instructions to positively impact both health-relevant behavior and sensory experience associated with eating food. Implications for both theory and clinical applications of mindfulness are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Extending previous research, we applied latent profile analysis in a sample of adults with a history of recurrent depression to identify subgroups with distinct response profiles on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and understand how these relate to psychological functioning. The sample was randomly divided into two subsamples to first examine the optimal number of latent profiles (test sample; n = 343) and then validate the identified solution (validation sample; n = 340). In both test and validation samples, a four-profile solution was revealed where two profiles mapped broadly onto those previously identified in nonclinical samples: \"high mindfulness\" and \"nonjudgmentally aware.\" Two additional subgroups, \"moderate mindfulness\" and \"very low mindfulness,\" were observed. \"High mindfulness\" was associated with the most adaptive psychological functioning and \"very low mindfulness\" with the least adaptive. In most people with recurrent depression, mindfulness skills are expressed evenly across different domains. However, in a small minority a meaningful and replicable uneven profile indicating nonjudgmental awareness is observable. Current findings require replication and future research should examine the extent to which profiles change from periods of wellness to illness in people with recurrent depression and how profiles are influenced by exposure to mindfulness-based intervention.",

        "title": "A randomised study to evaluate the potential added value of shared meditation involving people with cancer, health professionals and third persons compared to meditation conducted with patients only: design of the Implic-2 protocol.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In oncology, the suffering of patients and the burnout of health professionals are key issues. Mindfulness meditation is a holistic approach that can help to improve well-being. While numerous studies have shown the benefits of meditation for both patients and health professionals, the added value of offering shared meditation to groups of patients, health professionals and third persons has not been assessed. Beyond strengthening the relationship between carers and patients, opening up meditation sessions to third parties (neither carers nor patients) enables patients to escape the stigma of their illness. We previously conducted a pilot study that validated the feasibility and the relevance of shared meditation with a specifically designed programme. METHODS/DESIGN: IMPLIC-2 is a two-arm randomised study designed to assess the added value of this meditation programme (optimised following the pilot study), particularly for cancer patients (our target population). People motivated to follow the programme, without previous regular practice of meditation and able to participate in the sessions are eligible. The study will include 96 participants: 16 health professionals, 16 third persons and 64 patients. The latter will be randomized in two arms: the experimental arm (\"Shared\" meditation) consisting of 4 mixed groups of 8 patients, 4 health professionals and 4 third parties, and the control arm (\"Patient\" meditation) consisting of 2 groups of 16 patients. Validated questionnaires will be used to measure the effects of the programme, notably in terms of quality of life, perceived stress, feelings of self-efficacy, qualities of mindfulness and self-compassion, and carers' burn-out. Participants' perception of a change in their quality of life and satisfaction will be measured at the end of the programme. A complementary qualitative focus-group approach will be used to optimise implementation of the programme beyond the study. DISCUSSION: The well-being of oncology patients would be improved. Dealing with overworked carers would have a beneficial impact on the way they interact with patients. In addition, encounters between the three types of population will allow otherness to be viewed differently and alleviate suffering by promoting collective humanity.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: It is often assumed that psychosocial pain treatments work because of specific active components of the intervention. The degree to which common factors may contribute to improved pain outcomes is not well researched. The purpose of this study was to examine patient-related and therapist-related common factors during a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for headache pain trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a parallel group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial in which MBCT was compared with a control. A series of linear regression models and 1 bootstrap mediation model were conducted with the sample of participants that completed MBCT (N=21). RESULTS: In-session participant engagement was positively associated with treatment dose indicators of session attendance (P=0.038) and at-home meditation practice (P=0.027). Therapist adherence and quality were both significant predictors of posttreatment client satisfaction (P=0.038 and 0.034, respectively). Therapist appropriateness was not significantly associated with any of the variables of interest (P>0.05). Baseline pain intensity was positively associated with pretreatment expectations and motivations (P=0.049) and working alliance (P=0.048), and working alliance significantly predicted posttreatment patient satisfaction (P<0.001). Higher pretreatment expectations and motivation significantly predicted greater improvement in pretreatment to posttreatment change in pain interference (P=0.016); however, this relation was fully mediated by baseline pain intensity (P<0.05). DISCUSSION: Common factors play an important role in improving pain outcomes and patient satisfaction during a MBCT for headache pain intervention. Stimulating positive pretreatment expectations and patient motivation, as well as building strong rapport is an important component of treatment success.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caregivers of people with chronic conditions are more likely than non-caregivers to have depression and emotional problems. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in improving their mental well-being. METHODS: Caregivers of persons with chronic conditions who scored 7 or above in the Caregiver Strain Index were randomly assigned to the 8-week MBSR group (n = 70) or the self-help control group (n = 71). Validated instruments were used to assess the changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, self-efficacy, self-compassion and mindfulness. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at the 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Compared to the participants in the control group, participants in the MBSR group had a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms at post-intervention and at 3 months post-intervention (p < 0.01). The improvement in state anxiety symptoms was significantly greater among participants in the MBSR group than those of the control group at post-intervention (p = 0.007), although this difference was not statistically significant at 3 months post-intervention (p = 0.084). There was also a statistically significant larger increase in self-efficacy (controlling negative thoughts; p = 0.041) and mindfulness (p = 0.001) among participants in the MBSR group at the 3-month follow-up compared to the participants in the control group. No statistically significant group effects (MBSR vs. control) were found in perceived stress, quality of life or self-compassion. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR appears to be a feasible and acceptable intervention to improve mental health among family caregivers with significant care burden, although further studies that include an active control group are needed to make the findings more conclusive.",

While selected mindfulness-based interventions are effective in addressing symptoms of BPD, less is known regarding the effects of engaging in brief mindfulness practices on affective correlates of BPD. The present study investigated the effects of engaging in brief, daily mindfulness practice in a sample of young adults with elevated BPD symptoms. Ninety-two participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 2 weeks of daily mindfulness meditation or relaxation practice (active control), or to a no-practice control condition. Participants completed measures assessing depression, anxiety, stress, shame, difficulties with emotion regulation, trait mindfulness, and self-compassion before and after the practice period. Compared to the no-practice control condition, mindfulness practice resulted in significant improvements in trait mindfulness and self-compassion, whereas relaxation practice led to reductions in emotion regulation difficulties. No significant differences were found on any of the other outcomes between the mindfulness and relaxation conditions. The findings suggest that while both mindfulness and relaxation-based practices are effective in targeting selected transdiagnostic processes associated with BPD, more intensive interventions may be required for the practices to induce changes at the level of psychological symptoms.",

The accessibility of mindfulness-based interventions for cancer patients could be further improved by providing mindfulness using an individual internet-based format. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) group intervention for cancer patients in comparison with individual internet-based MBCT and treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS/DESIGN: A three-armed multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing group-based MBCT to individual internet-based MBCT and TAU in cancer patients who suffer from at least mild psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) \u2265 11). Measurements will be conducted prior to randomization (baseline), post-treatment and at 3 months and 9 months post-treatment. Participants initially allocated to TAU are subsequently randomized to either group- or individual internet-based MBCT and will receive a second baseline measurement after 3 months. Thus, the three-armed comparison will have a time span of approximately 3 months. The two-armed intervention comparison includes a 9-month follow-up and will also consist of participants randomized to the intervention after TAU. Primary outcome will be post-treatment psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes are fear of cancer recurrence (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory), rumination (Rumination and Reflection Questionnaire), positive mental health (Mental Health Continuum - Short Form), and cost-effectiveness (health-related quality of life (EuroQol -5D and Short Form-12) and health care usage (Trimbos and iMTA questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness).

METHODS: Patients between the ages of 13-21 years who received primary pediatric care at our urban outpatient clinic were eligible for study participation. Those who were interested were consented and randomly assigned to an eight-week program of MBSR or Healthy Topics (HT), a health education curriculum. To increase sensitivity to outcomes of interest, mixed methods were used to assess psychological symptoms, coping, and program experience. Analysis of variance and regression modeling were used; interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and coded for key themes. RESULTS: A total of 43 (26 MBSR, 17 HT) youths attended one or more sessions, of whom 35 [20 MBSR (77%), 15 HT (88%)] attended the majority of the sessions and were considered completers. Program completers were African American, 80% female, with average age of 15.0 years. Statistical analysis of survey data did not identify significant post-program differences between groups. Qualitative data show comparable positive experiences in both programs, but specific differences related to MBSR participants\u05f3 use of mindfulness techniques to calm down and avoid conflicts, as well as descriptions of internal processes and self-regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an active control program, MBSR did not result in statistically significant differences in self-reported survey outcomes of interest but was associated with qualitative outcomes of increased calm, conflict avoidance, self-awareness, and self-regulation for urban youths. Importantly, based on qualitative results, the HT program functioned as an effective active control for MBSR in this sample, facilitating a more rigorous methodological approach to MBSR research in this population. We believe the promising effects elucidated in the qualitative data have the potential for positive affective and behavioral outcomes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on biological and symptomatological markers of health among human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial design, data from 173 HIV+ patients (CD4 count > 250) not yet receiving antiretroviral therapy, who participated in either an 8-week MBSR (n = 87) or a brief education and support condition (n = 86) at the Imam Khomeini Hospital, were analyzed. Assessments included CD4 count, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90R), and Medical Symptom Checklist (MSCL) at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up periods. RESULTS: The treatment-adherent sample had a mean (standard deviation) age of 35.1 (6.5) years and 69% were male. Linear mixed-model estimates indicated that, in the MBSR condition, the mean CD4 count increased from baseline up to 9 months after treatment and then returned to baseline level at 12 months. Improvements in mean SCL-90R (up to 6 months) and MSCL (up to 12 months) scores were observed for the MBSR condition, whereas education and support condition scores remained the same over time; however, only MSCL improvements significantly differed between groups and these changes lasted up to the final assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that among treatment-adherent Iranian HIV+ patients not yet receiving antiretroviral drug treatment, MBSR seems to have the strongest potential to improve self-reported medical symptoms.

METHOD: 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients with chronic cough were studied in two sequential trials. For both studies, cough reflex sensitivity to citric acid (C5) was measured on two occasions, with urge to cough rated following each inhalation; between challenges subjects were randomised to (1) no intervention, (2) mindfulness or (3) no intervention but modified cough challenge (subjects suppress coughing). For the healthy volunteers, measures were 1 h apart and mindfulness was practised for 15 min. For the patients with chronic cough measures were 1 week apart and mindfulness was practised daily for 30 min. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers, median change (interquartile range (IQR)) in cough reflex sensitivity (logC5) for no intervention, mindfulness and suppression was +1.0 (0.0 to +1.3), +2.0 (+1.0 to +3.0) and +3.0 (+2.8 to +3.0) doubling concentrations (p = 0.003); there were significant reductions for both mindfulness (p = 0.043) and suppression (p = 0.002) over no intervention. In patients with cough, median change (IQR) in logC5 for no intervention, mindfulness training and voluntary suppression was 0.0 (-1.0 to +1.0), +1.0 (-0.3 to +1.0) and +1.0 (+1.0 to +2.0) doubling concentrations (p = 0.046); there was a significant reduction for suppression (p = 0.02) but not mindfulness (p = 0.35). Urge to cough did not change after mindfulness compared with control in either healthy subjects (p = 0.33) or those with chronic cough (p = 0.47). CONCLUSION: Compared with control, mindfulness decreased cough reflex sensitivity in healthy volunteers, but did not alter cough threshold in patients with chronic cough. Both groups were able to suppress cough responses to citric acid inhalation.",

        "title": "LessStress - how to reduce stress in school: evaluation of a universal stress prevention in schools: study protocol of a cluster-randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is detrimental to health, and children and young people have had to cope with significantly more stress since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, stress at school and in relation to learning is a major problem in this age group. Studies in Germany have indicated that the pandemic has led to a reduced quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Schools are an ideal setting for interventions against stress, which is one of the strongest predictors for the development of psychosocial problems. The present study seeks to address stress by means of a short prevention training programme in schools, including emotion regulation, mindfulness, and self-compassion. In addition to information material for self-study, students should have the opportunity to actively deal with the topic of stress and develop coping strategies within a short space of time. In contrast to very long stress reduction programmes that often last several weeks, the programme is delivered in just 90 min. METHODS: The effectiveness of the short and economical prevention programme LessStress will be examined in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) encompassing 1894 students. At several measurement time points, students from two groups (intervention and control) will be asked about their subjectively perceived stress levels, among other aspects. Due to the clustered nature of the data, mainly multilevel analyses will be performed. DISCUSSION: In Germany, there are no nationwide universal prevention programmes for students against stress in schools, and this gap has become more evident since the outbreak of the pandemic. Universal stress prevention in schools may be a starting point to promote resilience. By dealing with stress in a healthy way, mental health can be strengthened and maintained. Moreover, to reach at-risk students at an early stage, we advocate for a stronger networking between child psychiatry and schools.

In this randomised control trial, 44 human services professionals were randomly allocated either to a MMTP retreat group or to a control group. Following the MMTP intervention, no significant differences between the retreat and control groups were found on resilience, mindfulness and self-compassion variables. However, significant improvements were observed over time for the retreat group for mindfulness and self-compassion at one and four months and for resilience at four-months post MMTP intervention.

        "abstract": "Background: Police officers' high-stress levels and its deleterious consequences are raising awareness to an epidemic of mental health problems and quality of life (QoL) impairment. There is a growing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions are efficacious to promote mental health and well-being among high-stress occupations. Methods: The POLICE study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three assessment points (baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up) where police officers were randomized to mindfulness-based health promotion (MBHP) (n = 88) or a waiting list (n = 82). This article focuses on QoL, depression and anxiety symptoms, and religiosity outcomes. Mechanisms of change and MBHP feasibility were evaluated. Results: Significant group * time interaction was found for QoL, depression and anxiety symptoms, and non-organizational religiosity. Between-group analysis showed that MBHP group exhibited greater improvements in QoL, and depression and anxiety symptoms at both post-intervention (QoL d = 0.69 to 1.01; depression d = 0.97; anxiety d = 0.73) and 6-month follow-up (QoL d = 0.41 to 0.74; depression d = 0.60; anxiety d = 0.51), in addition to increasing non-organizational religiosity at post-intervention (d = 0.31). Changes on self-compassion mediated the relationship between group and pre-to-post changes for all QoL domains and facets. Group effect on QoL overall health facet at post-intervention was moderated by mindfulness trait and spirituality changes. Conclusion: MBHP is feasible and efficacious to improve QoL, and depression and anxiety symptoms among Brazilian officers. Results were maintained after 6 months. MBHP increased non-organizational religiosity, although the effect was not sustained 6 months later. To our knowledge, this is the first mindfulness-based intervention RCT to empirically demonstrate these effects among police officers. Self-compassion, mindfulness trait, and spirituality mechanisms of change are examined. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov. identifier: NCT03114605.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Heartfulness meditation practice, compared to Gratitude practice, leads to measurable changes in mental wellbeing among healthcare providers across the US. METHOD: Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following 6-week interventions: the trainer-guided virtual Heartfulness meditation program or the podcast-based self-guided gratitude practice group. The Professional Quality of Life Scale-5 (ProQOL-5) was used to determine Compassion Satisfaction (CS) and risk for Burnout (BO) and secondary traumatic stress (STS). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) was used to assess vigor, dedication, and absorption at work. Outcomes were collected at baseline and the end of the study period. Qualitative questions regarding the experience of learning and practicing were also offered at the end of the six weeks. RESULTS: The majority of participants were nurses (50%), followed by allied healthcare professionals (37%) and physicians (13%) (N = 83). There was a general trend towards increases in CS in the Heartfulness group compared to the gratitude group. However, this was not statistically significant. Strong evidence suggests there was a significant improvement in BO for the Heartfulness group between Week 0 and Week 6 (p = 0.002), as well as STS (p = 0.0004) and vigor (p = 0.0392). Qualitative data analysis revealed that the subjects in the Heartfulness arm reported improved sleep and decreased reactivity to stress. Subjects in the gratitude arm reported improved mood and favorable results using gratitude practices at home with family members. CONCLUSION: In our study, Heartfulness meditation practice was associated with a significant improvement in burnout and vigor at work, with a trend towards compassion satisfaction after six weeks compared with gratitude practices. Qualitative analysis indicates the benefits of both Heartfulness and Gratitude practices. Further randomized trials with a larger sample size are needed to explore these science-based practices for the wellbeing of healthcare workers.",

        "title": "The Chinese medicine construct \"stagnation\" in mind-body connection mediates the effects of mindfulness training on depression and anxiety.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have identified different, but highly correlated variables explaining the effects of mindfulness training. Many of them are limited by tautological explanation. Under the framework of the mind-body connection, mindfulness training cultivates body awareness and promotes self-management of illness. Stagnation, a concept from Chinese medicine, may help explain the mechanism of change in mindfulness training. METHODS: Individuals with depressive and anxiety symptoms (n=82) were randomized to either a Compassion-Mindfulness Therapy (C-MT) program or a waitlist control condition. The effect of stagnation as a mediator was investigated for dependent variables including depression, anxiety, and other physical and mental health variables. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stagnation, physical distress, daily functioning, positive affect, negative affect. RESULTS: Compared with the participants in the control group, those who completed C-MT demonstrated significant decreases in depression, F(1, 78)=15.67, p<.001, anxiety, F(1, 78)=7.72, p<.001, stagnation, F(1, 78)=4.96, p<.001, and other body-mind-spirit well-being measures. After entering the change in stagnation as the mediator, the effect of treatment reduced: depression (.35-.22), anxiety (.33-.05), and same patterns in other three secondary measures. The Sobel test was administered and significant reductions between group and depression (z=2.18, p=.029), anxiety (z=2.21, p=.027), and three secondary other measures (p<.05) were indicated. CONCLUSION: The study provides initial support for the role of stagnation in mediating changes in mindfulness training. It adds evidence to body-mind nondualism and offers new possibilities in studying treatment process and change mechanism.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Depression is a common comorbidity of diabetes, undesirably affecting patients' physical and mental functioning. Psychological interventions are effective treatments for depression in the general population as well as in patients with a chronic disease. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of individual mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in comparison with a waiting-list control condition for treating depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 94 outpatients with diabetes and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II] \u226514) were randomized to MBCT (n = 31), CBT (n = 32), or waiting list (n = 31). All participants completed written questionnaires and interviews at pre- and postmeasurement (3 months later). Primary outcome measure was severity of depressive symptoms (BDI-II and Toronto Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), well-being (Well-Being Index), diabetes-related distress (Problem Areas In Diabetes), and HbA1c levels were assessed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Results showed that participants receiving MBCT and CBT reported significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared with patients in the waiting-list control condition (respectively, P = 0.004 and P < 0.001; d = 0.80 and 1.00; clinically relevant improvement 26% and 29% vs. 4%). Both interventions also had significant positive effects on anxiety, well-being, and diabetes-related distress. No significant effect was found on HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Both individual MBCT and CBT are effective in improving a range of psychological symptoms in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

Previous research efforts suggesting this program may be beneficial in terms of reducing stress-related symptomatology and helping patients cope with chronic pain have been limited by a lack of adequate comparison control group. METHODS: Twenty-eight individuals who volunteered to participate in the present study were randomized into either an experimental group or a nonintervention control group. RESULTS: Following participation, experimental subjects, when compared with controls, evidenced significantly greater changes in terms of: (1) reductions in overall psychological symptomatology; (2) increase in overall domain-specific sense of control and utilization of an accepting or yielding mode of control in their lives, and (3) higher scores on a measure of spiritual experiences. CONCLUSIONS: The techniques of mindfulness meditation, with their emphasis on developing detached observation and awareness of the contents of consciousness, may represent a powerful cognitive behavioral coping strategy for transforming the ways in which we respond to life events. They may also have potential for relapse prevention in affective disorders.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a common condition that typically has a relapsing course. Effective interventions targeting relapse have the potential to dramatically reduce the point prevalence of the condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based intervention that has shown efficacy in reducing depressive relapse. While trials of MBCT to date have met the core requirements of phase 1 translational research, there is a need now to move to phase 2 translational research - the application of MBCT within real-world settings with a view to informing policy and clinical practice. The aim of this trial is to examine the clinical impact and health economics of MBCT under real-world conditions and where efforts have been made to assess for and prevent resentful demoralization among the control group. Secondary aims of the project involve extending the phase 1 agenda to an examination of the effects of co-morbidity and mechanisms of action. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is designed as a prospective, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a group comparison design between involving the intervention, MBCT, and a self-monitoring comparison condition, Depression Relapse Active Monitoring (DRAM). Follow-up is over 2 years. The design of the study indicates recruitment from primary and secondary care of 204 participants who have a history of 3 or more episodes of Major Depression but who are currently well. Measures assessing depressive relapse/recurrence, time to first clinical intervention, treatment expectancy and a range of secondary outcomes and process variables are included. A health economics evaluation will be undertaken to assess the incremental cost of MBCT. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial, including an examination of clinical, functional and health economic outcomes, will be used to assess the role that this treatment approach may have in recommendations for treatment of depression in Australia and elsewhere. If the findings are positive, we expect that this research will consolidate the evidence base to guide the decision to fund MBCT and to seek to promote its availability to those who have experienced at least 3 episodes of depression.

Our objective is to compare the clinical effectiveness of the MBCT program with a psycho-education programme and usual care in reducing anxiety symptoms in people suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS: A three armed randomized, controlled clinical trial including 9-month post-treatment follow-up is proposed. Participants screened positive using the Structure Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for general anxiety disorder will be recruited from community-based clinics. 228 participants will be randomly allocated to the MBCT program plus usual care, psycho-education program plus usual care or the usual care group. Validated Chinese version of instruments measuring anxiety and worry symptoms, depression, quality of life and health service utilization will be used. Our primary end point is the change of anxiety and worry score (Beck Anxiety Inventory and Penn State Worry Scale) from baseline to the end of intervention. For primary analyses, treatment outcomes will be assessed by ANCOVA, with change in anxiety score as the baseline variable, while the baseline anxiety score and other baseline characteristics that significantly differ between groups will serve as covariates. CONCLUSIONS: This is a first randomized controlled trial that compare the effectiveness of MBCT with an active control, findings will advance current knowledge in the management of GAD and the way that group intervention can be delivered and inform future research.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the impact of a breathing awareness meditation (BAM) program on ambulatory blood pressure and sodium handling in African American adolescents with high-normal systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels. DESIGN AND METHODS: Following three consecutive days of SBP screenings, 66 eligible ninth graders were randomly assigned by school to either BAM (n = 20) or health education control (n = 46) groups. The BAM group engaged in 10-minute BAM sessions at school and at home each day for three months. Teachers conducted sessions at school during health classes. Before and after the intervention, overnight urine samples were collected, and ambulatory SBP, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded periodically for 24 hours. RESULTS: Significant changes before and after the intervention were observed between BAM and control groups for SBP during school hours (-4.7 vs .9 mm Hg, P < .05), SBP at night (-4.8 vs -.6 mm Hg, P < .01), and heart rate during school hours (-6.7 vs -2.3 bpm, P < .02), adjusted for their respective preintervention levels. The overnight urinary sodium excretion rate decreased in the BAM group but increased in the control group (-.3 +/- 4.9 vs 1.1 +/- 4.0 mEq/hour, P < .03).

One way to address this need is to develop and test if culturally responsive mobile health (mhealth) applications are efficacious in reducing stress-related outcomes in this population. With this goal in mind, we employed a repeated-measures randomized control trial (RCT) across a 12-week intervention period to evaluate if participants in the intervention group outperformed a wait-list control group in reductions in stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, emotional regulation difficulties as well as in increases in self-compassion, resilience, and mindfulness attitudes and behaviors. Our sample included 170 Black/African American participants who were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition (n = 84) or the wait-list control group (n = 86). Participants in the intervention condition reported more self-compassion, used more mindfulness, and had greater self-efficacy using mindfulness; yet, no other differences were evident. Participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the app and gave it a positive rating for its relevance to their lives. These findings support the efficacy of a culturally responsive mindfulness mHealth app to enhance self-compassion and increase the use of health-promoting behaviors, like mindfulness, among African Americans.

        "title": "Innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress do not predict subsequent compassion meditation practice time.",
        "abstract": "Increasing data suggest that meditation impacts stress-related physiological processes relevant to health and disease. For example, our group recently reported that the practice of compassion meditation was associated with reduced innate immune (plasma interleukin [IL]-6) and subjective distress responses to a standardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]). However, because we administered a TSST after, but not prior to, meditation training in our initial study, it remained possible that associations between practice time and TSST outcomes reflected the fact that participants with reduced stress responses prior to training were more able to practice compassion meditation, rather than that meditation practice reduced stress responses. To help resolve this ambiguity, we conducted the current study to evaluate whether innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to a TSST conducted prior to compassion meditation training in an independent sample of 32 medically health young adults would predict subsequent amount of meditation practice time during a compassion meditation training protocol identical to the one used in our first study. No associations were found between responses to a TSST administered prior to compassion meditation training and subsequent amount of meditation practice, whether practice time was considered as a continuous variable or whether meditators were divided into high and low practice time groups based on a median split of mean number of practice sessions per week. These findings contrast strikingly with our original study, in which high and low practice time meditators demonstrated marked differences in IL-6 and distress responses to a TSST administered after meditation training. In addition to providing the first published data regarding stress responsivity as a potential predictor of subsequent ability/willingness to practice meditation, the current study strengthens findings from our initial work by supporting the conclusion that in individuals who actively engage in practicing the technique, compassion meditation may represent a viable strategy for reducing potentially deleterious physiological and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress.",

Compared to AE, MBSR yielded greater (i) reductions in negative emotion when implementing regulation and (ii) increases in attention-related parietal cortical regions. Meditation practice was associated with decreases in negative emotion and social anxiety symptom severity, and increases in attention-related parietal cortex neural responses when implementing attention regulation of negative self-beliefs.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is evidence that various meditation practices reduce distress, but little is known about the mechanisms of frequently repeating a mantram-a spiritual word or phrase-on distress reduction. Mantram repetition is the portable practice of focusing attention frequently on a mantram throughout the day without a specific time, place, or posture. PURPOSE: We examined the hypothesis of whether increases in positive reappraisal coping or distancing coping mediated the sustained decreases in anger found following a group-based mantram intervention that was designed to train attention and promote awareness of internal experiences. METHOD: A secondary analysis was performed on data collected from a randomized controlled trial that compared a group-based mantram intervention (n = 46) to an attention-matched control (n = 47) in a community sample of human immunodeficiency virus-positive adults. Positive reappraisal and distancing coping were explored as potential mediators of anger reduction. RESULTS: Participants in the mantram intervention reported significant increases in positive reappraisal coping over the 5-week intervention period, whereas the control group reported decreases. Increases in positive reappraisal coping during the 5-week intervention period appear to mediate the effect of mantram on decreased anger at 22-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a group-based mantram intervention may reduce anger by enhancing positive reappraisal coping.",

        "abstract": "Positive affect (PA) has an important role in resilience against depression and has been shown to increase with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of change in PA as well as develop insights that may benefit personalized medicine, the current study examined the contribution of genetic variation to individual differences in change in PA in response to MBCT. Individuals (n=126) with residual depressive symptoms were randomized to either an MBCT group or treatment as usual. PA was assessed using experience sampling methodology (ESM). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes known to be involved in reward functioning were selected. SNPs in the genes for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (CHRM2), the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and the \u03bc1 opioid receptor (OPRM1) significantly moderated the impact of treatment condition over time on PA. Genetic variation in the genes for CHRM2 and OPRM1 specifically had an impact on the level of PA following MBCT. The current study shows that variation in response to MBCT may be contingent on genetic factors associated with the regulation of PA. These findings contribute to our understanding of the processes moderating response to treatment and prediction of treatment outcome.",

        "title": "A brief self-administered psychological intervention to improve well-being in patients with cancer: results from a feasibility study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer have relatively high rates of anxiety and distress, adversely affecting their well-being and quality of life. Recent studies indicate that addressing these symptoms could result in better response to cancer treatment. Researchers have found that interventions that focus on increasing mental awareness and the frequency of positive experiences may have a greater impact on reducing psychological morbidity and increasing quality of life than interventions that target relief of psychological symptoms. AIM: To develop and test a brief, easy to use intervention that could improve well-being and quality of life in cancer patients. METHODS: We developed a simple well-being intervention that made few demands on patient time and required little training resource. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a deferred entry group. Measures of anxiety, depression, well-being and quality of life were administered at baseline and at follow-ups. RESULTS: Twenty-two women with metastatic breast cancer and 24 men with metastatic prostate cancer were recruited from oncology clinics. Thirteen women and 14 men completed the study. Both qualitative and quantitative data showed that the intervention was acceptable to users. There was statistically significant improvement in quality of life scores on WHOQOL-BREF post-intervention (p=0.046). Compliance with the intervention was good. CONCLUSIONS: This brief well-being intervention appears to be a promising technique for improving quality of life of cancer patients, without making undue demands on staff resources or patient time. If further studies confirm its effectiveness, it could prove to be a cost-effective intervention.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the practice of meditation is also related to alterations in low-level, bottom-up processing. Therefore, intersensory facilitation (IF) effects in a group of mindfulness meditators (MM) were compared to IF effects in an age- and gender-matched control group. Smaller and even absent IF effects were found in the MM group, which suggests that changes in bottom-up processing are associated with MM. Furthermore, reduced interference of a visual warning stimulus with the IF effects was found, which suggests an improved allocation of attentional resources in mindfulness meditators, even across modalities.",

        "abstract": "Reducing negative impacts of stress, for example through mindfulness training, benefits physical and psychological well-being and is becoming ever more crucial owing to large-scale societal uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19). Whereas extensive research has focused on mindfulness-related reductions in self-reported negativity, essentially no research has targeted task-based behavioral outcomes throughout long-term mindfulness trainings. Responses to emotionally ambiguous signals (e.g., surprised expressions), which might be appraised as either positive or negative, provide a nuanced assessment of one's emotional bias across diverse contexts, offering unique leverage for assessing the effects of mindfulness. Here, we compared the effects of short- and long-term training via Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on ratings of faces with a relatively clear (angry, happy) and ambiguous (surprised) valence. Ratings became more positive for ambiguity from the start (Week 1) to end of training (Week 8; p < .001), but there were no short-term effects (from a single class session). This shift toward positivity continued through an additional 8-week follow-up (Week 16; p < .001). Notably, posttraining valence bias (Week 8) was uniquely predicted by the nonreactivity facet of mindfulness (p = .01). Together, mindfulness promotes a relatively long-lasting shift toward positivity bias, which is uniquely supported by reduced emotional reactivity.",

        "title": "Longitudinal Factorial Invariance of a Brief Measure of Affect and Calm Focus.",
        "abstract": "Mindfulness-based practices for school-aged children are increasingly common in the United States. Positive and negative affect are theoretically and empirically associated with school outcomes, and these constructs are likely to be impacted by school-based mindfulness practices. Furthermore, mindful states, such as being calm and focused, targeted by mindfulness-based practices are a potential causal mechanism to improve learning and behavior. This study describes a test of longitudinal factorial invariance for a brief measure of affect states plus a state of calm focus that is appropriate for use in mindfulness intervention studies with elementary school-aged children. Data were collected from 97 fourth-grade students in an urban elementary school that was about 46% Hispanic and 44% White. Students listened to one of six different conditions each day for 24 school days: There were four individual mindfulness modules (cross-connect, pause buttons, belly breathing, and mindful minute), one condition that included all four of the modules together, and one condition that was a control activity (a grade-appropriate story presented via audiorecording). Students provided self-report of positive and negative emotions plus calm focus immediately before and after the presentation of the audio. Results showed high levels of internal consistency for the scales, low correlations between scales, and factorial invariance in the pre- and post-test design for five of the six conditions. These findings support the use of this measure in studies with older elementary school students. Future studies should further document construct validity through external validation of the scales.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has placed incredible demands on healthcare workers (HCWs) and adversely impacted their well-being. Throughout the pandemic, organizations have sought to implement brief and flexible mental health interventions to better support employees. Few studies have explored HCWs' lived experiences of participating in brief, online mindfulness programming during the pandemic using qualitative methodologies. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with HCWs and program facilitators (n = 13) who participated in an online, four-week, mindfulness-based intervention program. The goals of this study were to: (1) understand how participants experienced work during the pandemic; (2) understand how the rapid switch to online life impacted program delivery and how participants experienced the mindfulness program; and (3) describe the role of the mindfulness program in supporting participants' mental health and well-being. We utilized interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) to elucidate participants' and facilitators' rich and meaningful lived experiences and identified patterns of experiences through a cross-case analysis. This resulted in four main themes: (1) changing environments; (2) snowball of emotions; (3) connection and disconnection; and (4) striving for resilience. Findings from this study highlight strategies for organizations to create and support wellness programs for HCWs in times of public health crises. These include improving social connection in virtual care settings, providing professional development and technology training for HCWs to adapt to rapid environmental changes, and recognizing the difference between emotions and emotional states in HCWs involved in mindfulness-based programs.",

        "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that mindfulness-based therapies may be effective in treating a variety of disorders including stress, chronic pain, depression and anxiety. However, there are few valid and reliable measures of mindfulness. Furthermore, mindfulness is often thought to be related to spirituality, given its roots in Buddhist tradition, but empirical studies on this relationship are difficult to find. The present study: (1) tested the reliability and validity of a new mindfulness measure, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), (2) explored the relationship between mindfulness and spirituality, and (3) investigated the relationship between mindfulness and/or spirituality and alcohol and tobacco use in an undergraduate college population (N= 196). Results support the reliability of the FMI and suggest that spirituality and mindfulness may be separate constructs. In addition, smoking and frequent binge-drinking were negatively correlated with spirituality scores; as spirituality scores increased the use of alcohol and tobacco decreased. Thus, spirituality may be related to decreased substance use. In contrast, a positive relationship between mindfulness and smoking/frequent bingedrinking behavior was uncovered, and warrants further investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation is thought to lead to positive changes in cognitive and affective functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. One reason for this is that so far only very few studies considered the effects of specific meditation practices. We thus investigated the effects of engaging in one specific form of mindfulness meditation for a brief time period on behavioral and neural indicators of inhibitory control and metacognition. Performance on the Go/No-Go task and concurrent neural activity (EEG) was assessed before and after participants engaged in 3 weeks of mindful breath awareness meditation. Compared to a waitlist control group, meditation training enhanced the N2 event-related potential in No-Go trials and the error-related negativity (ERN) after error responses. As these two components reflect conflict and response monitoring, respectively, our results support the notion that mindfulness meditation improves metacognitive processes. The changes in the ERN were correlated with the accumulated amount of meditation time, highlighting the importance of meditation practice. Furthermore, meditation improved a behavioral marker of impulsive responding, indicating the relevance of mindfulness-based approaches for supporting health-related behaviors that are associated with deficits in impulsive control, such as substance abuse or over-eating. This study demonstrated that investigating one particular meditation practice rather than complex mindfulness-based interventions can contribute to a deeper understanding of mindfulness meditation mechanisms.",

The objective of the present study protocol is to describe the methods that will be used in a cluster randomised trial (CRT) that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness eating (ME) programme to reduce emotional eating (EE) in adults with overweight/ obesity in primary care (PC) settings.Methods and analysis A CRT will be conducted with approximately 76 adults with overweight/obesity from four PC health centres (dusters) in the city of Zaragoza, Spain. Health centres matched to the average per capita income of the assigned population will be randomly allocated into two groups: 'ME +treatment as usual (TAU)' and 'TAU alone'. The ME programme will be composed of seven sessions delivered by a clinical psychologist, and TAU will be offered by general practitioners. The primary outcome will be EE measured by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEN) at post test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be external and restrained eating (DEBQ), binge eating (Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh), eating disorder (Eating Attitude Test), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), mindful eating (Mindful Eating Scale), dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale). Anthropometric measures, vital signs and blood tests will be taken. A primary intention-to-treat analysis on EE will be conducted using linear mixed models. Supplementary analyses will include secondary outcomes and 1-year follow-up measures; adjusted models controlling for sex, weight status and levels of anxiety and depression; the complier average causal effect of treatment; and the clinical significance of improvements.",

        "abstract": "Empirical research has demonstrated associations between heart rate variability (HRV) and the regulation of emotion and behavior. Similarly, self-regulation of attention to one's experience of the present moment in an accepting and nonjudgmental manner is an essential characteristic of mindfulness that promotes emotional and behavioral regulation and psychological well-being. The present study investigated the relationship between mindfulness and HRV. A total of 23 undergraduate psychology students completed a recently developed measure of mindfulness, the mindful breathing exercise (MBE), which assesses the ability to mindfully stay in contact with one's breath during breathing meditation. Moreover, indices of HRV were measured during a short version of the MBE. As predicted, positive correlations were found between indices of HRV and mindfulness. The findings demonstrate that the ability to mindfully regulate one's attention is associated with higher HRV, a physiological correlate of physical and psychological health, and therefore support on a physiological level the potential benefit of the implemented mindfulness exercises in mindfulness-based clinical interventions.",

Participants were patients with depression and/or anxiety (N=19) in Japan. Of the 27 participants recruited, 19 participated in the study. Using stratified randomization, we allocated 10 participants to the intervention group, with an 8-week standard MBI, and nine to the waitlist control group.

The results revealed that depression, trait anxiety, trait mindfulness, and trait self-compassion did not significantly change. However, SC behaviors, mindful behaviors, and mood significantly improved with MBI. Moreover, the interaction between SC behaviors and mindful behaviors was significantly shown in the pre-intervention, suggesting that SC behaviors moderate the effect of mindful behaviors on mood in daily life.",

We address this important gap by examining self-structure in individuals with persecutory delusions using the card sort task, an established paradigm measuring key self-structure indices, including the degree to which self-structure is compartmentalized (characterized by primarily positive or negative attributes, as opposed to a mix of both), and the proportion and importance of nega-tive attributes. In Study 1, individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum diag-nosis with current persecutory delusions (clinical group, n = 27) and a healthy control group (n = 47) were com-pared on self-structure indices. In Study 2 (n = 27), the clin-ical group also completed the card sort task before and after randomization to either a 12-week mindfulness -based psychological therapy or treatment-as-usual control. In Study 1, self-structure differed significantly between the clinical and control groups. The clinical group had a greater proportion of negative attributes, assigned more importance to negative self-aspects, and had more com-partmentalized self-structures compared with controls. In Study 2 there were no associations between delusion sever-ity and self-structure. Large effect sizes for reductions in compartmentalization and proportion of negative attri-butes across self-aspects were found following mindfulness therapy. The findings highlight key differences in self -structure between individuals with persecutory delusions and healthy controls, and suggest that it might be possible to change self-structure following psychological therapy. These data support the central role of the self in theoretical models of paranoid thinking.",

Given dramatic strides during adolescence in competencies that may support mindfulness (e.g., emotion regulation), the high school years are a suitable window to study developmental changes in mindfulness. Using an accelerated cohort design to examine the longitudinal trajectory of mindfulness from 9th grade through 12th grade, we employed data from a 5-year study of 3,453 U.S. adolescents (55% female; 40% Latinx, 38% White, 13% Black, and 7% Asian) from high schools in three geographical regions in the U.S. Adolescents annually completed self-report surveys measuring mindful awareness and several internal and external factors. Latent growth curve analyses found that, after controlling for cohort, there was no average linear change in mindful awareness from grades 9 through 12, although there was significant interindividual variability in slopes. Within-person analyses found that in grades when needs-supportive climate was higher and discrimination was lower, adolescents reported greater mindful awareness. Unexpectedly, in grades when perspective taking and prosocial behaviors were higher, mindfulness was lower. These findings inform developmental understanding of mindful awareness and the ways that it naturally occurs and is supported during adolescence.",

We assessed an abbreviated four-week, twice-weekly mindfulness-based inter-vention program's effect on work-related mental health variables and examined whether the intervention impact was maintained at two-and six-month follow-up assessments. We also examined the training program's effects on work and life. Background: Previous research has shown that mindfulness interventions exert positive effects immediately after treatment. However, few studies have examined whether treatment effects are maintained over time or under different circumstances. Moreover, treatment effects among Chinese intensive care unit nurses have rarely been examined. Design: We conducted a randomized, non-blinded, parallel-group trial.

The resulting model outlines an experiential progression from psychoeducation and skill development/practice to increased mindful awareness, and empowered state experiences which led to the following outcomes: independent positive action, self-initiated positive state experiences, and increased embodied well-being. Participants reported increased self-compassion and self-acceptance, with decreased emphasis on disordered eating behaviors. Qualitative data is necessary for understanding why yoga works, from an experiential perspective.

        "abstract": "Young adult cancer survivors (YACS) are a vulnerable population that reports high anxiety, social isolation, and feelings of inadequacy after cancer treatment completion. Mindful self-compassion (MSC) provides strategies for coping with suffering. We explored how MSC practices addressed the psychosocial needs of a nationally recruited YACS sample (N=20, all female, age M=27.00, various cancer types) that participated in an 8-week MSC video-chat intervention. Descriptive qualitative analysis of the intervention recordings revealed three YACS' psychosocial needs: peer isolation, body concerns, and health-related anxiety. MSC practices addressed these in a number of ways including: self-reliance for emotional support, common humanity within the YACS community, gratitude, self-kindness, and acceptance. Meanwhile, the body scan practice initially triggered distress for some; implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Self-compassion involves the capacity to accept one's negative emotional experiences with kindness and mindful awareness, acknowledging them as part of the human condition. The present work is premised on the idea that self-compassion may be tied to the degree to which individuals are able to distinguish among their negative emotional states. We hypothesized that psychotherapy clients high in self-compassion will be better at distinguishing among their negative (but not positive) emotional states. Clients (N = 136) from a community clinic completed the Self Compassion Scale pre-and post-treatment. Clients' self-compassion levels as well as their emotional states were monitored before and after each psychotherapy session, respectively. Negative emotion differentiation was associated with both treatment and session level self-compassion; in contrast, positive emotion differentiation was not correlated with self-compassion levels. The implications of the findings will be discussed in light of contemporary accounts of self-compassion, affect dynamics, and affect regulation.",

Mindfulness-based programs for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) emerged about 20 years ago. Efficacy and effectiveness studies provide the evidence-base for these programs and the field of IDD is moving towards large scale implementation of these programs. This article presents a model for implementing mindfulness-based programs in community settings, including family and group homes, schools, vocational settings, and congregate care facilities. The model is based on the 3-tier positive behavior support (PBS) system commonly used in school, family, and agency settings. Specific mindfulness-based programs can be linked to each of the three tiers to improve the quality of life of people with IDD.",

        "title": "Study protocol of guided mobile-based perinatal mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI) - a randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "BackgroundPsychological distress is a common occurrence among women during the perinatal period. Maternal psychological distress (MPS) can also have a negative influence on neonatal outcomes such as infant health, child development or mother-child interaction. Hence, interventions to improve mental wellbeing during this period are vital. Mindfulness based intervention (MBI) has been found to be effective in reducing psychological distress. Delivery of MBI via the internet, making it accessible and inexpensive, is showing a promising positive effect in reducing psychological distress. A randomized control trial with sufficient power is required to confirm its positive effect among pregnant women. The positive effects of MBI have been found to be associated with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback; however, the efficacy of MBI on HRV has been rarely studied among pregnant women. Also, the potential association of HRV with MBI and psychological wellbeing needs further examination. This research aims to test the effectiveness of guided mobile-based perinatal mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI) among pregnant women experiencing psychological distress during the pre- and post-natal period, as well as examining the efficacy of GMBPMI on HRV.MethodThis study is a randomized controlled trial that follows a parallel design. Consenting pregnant women in their second trimester (between 12th and 20th week gestation) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (GMBPMI) or a control group (psychoeducation). The intended sample size is 198, with 99 participants in each group. Three levels of outcomes will be measured at baseline, post intervention in both the intervention and control groups, and at 36-week gestation and five-week postpartum. The primary outcomes include maternal psychological stress, mindfulness and positive appraisal HRV. Secondary outcomes are psychological and physical wellbeing. Tertiary outcomes include obstetric and neonatal outcomes, and social support. Analyses will follow an intention-to-treat method and repeated measures MANOVA will be conducted to compare changes in primary and secondary outcomes. A series of mixed-effects models will be fitted to assess the mediation effects.DiscussionThis trial expects to increase understanding of GMBPMI on HRV and psychological wellbeing for pregnant women, with extended support in both pre-and post-natal periods. The study could also potentially provide evidence for delivery of cost-effective and accessible services to pregnant women.",

Methods In total, 100 employees were recruited from a knowledge-based enterprise in China and randomly divided into the LKM training group (n = 50) and the control group (n = 50). The LKM training group underwent LKM training for 8 weeks, while the control group did not. Seven main variables (mindfulness, altruism positive affect, negative affect, playing dumb, rationalized hiding, and evasive hiding) were measured both before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the LKM training intervention. Results The LKM intervention significantly increased participants' altruism, and significantly reduced negative affect, playing dumb and evasive hiding, but did not significantly improve mindfulness, positive affect, and rationalized hiding. Conclusions LKM significantly improved employees' altruism, and significantly reduce their negative affect, but did not significantly improve their mindfulness and positive affect. For knowledge hiding, LKM significantly reduced playing dumb and evasive hiding, but had no significant effect on rationalized hiding. These results further elucidate the psychological effects of LKM and suggest the possibility of reducing knowledge hiding in the workplace.",

Community volunteers participated in an SCFM group or in a control group and self-reported at three points in time: at baseline (study, n = 73; control, n = 80), at the end of the 5-week five-session intervention (study, n = 57; control, n = 61) and at follow-up 5 weeks later (study, n = 47; control, n = 50). The SCFM was a Hebrew adaptation based on a mindful self-compassion programme, which is available online. The SCFM was held in person, in small groups (N < 20) over a 2-month period. A four-way interaction was found to be significant [F(2, 186) = 3.70, p = 0.027, & eta;(2)p = 0.038]. Post hoc tests showed that those who were initially low on self-compassion and participated in the SCFM experienced relief in their depressive symptoms and that their level of self-compassion was increased. This implies that self-compassion is a moderating trait, with the benefit of relieving suffering. By increasing the levels of self-compassion in individuals, it is possible to improve their psychological health.",

Participants were 57 full-time and part-time employees who completed a baseline survey and five daily diary entries. Data were analysed using multilevel modelling. On days when they experienced greater mindfulness, employees also experienced (a) greater daily job satisfaction via high-activation positive affect (but not low-activation positive affect nor negative affect) and (b) greater daily self-reported task performance via problem solving confidence. Our findings suggest that high-activation positive affect and problem solving confidence may be important daily mechanisms of mindfulness at work. Growing evidence links mindfulness to work-related outcomes; however, limited research has investigated the mechanisms involved. The present study is one of the first to collect empirical observations regarding how state mindfulness operates at work on a daily basis, providing support for both affective and cognitive pathways. Advances in this area can underpin a robust theoretical framework to guide the implementation of daily mindfulness practice and interventions targeting specific work-related outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Person-centered studies have grown in the mindfulness literature recently. Previous research has suggested four profiles of mindfulness, each with differential mental health and emotional outcomes. The present study supports the existence of these four profiles of mindfulness based on the five facets of mindfulness (observing, nonjudging, acting with awareness, nonreactivity, and describing). We provide further insight into differences in levels of psychopathology, positive psychology indicators, and spirituality among these profiles. Using model-selection criteria (e.g., BIC, AIC, entropy) in a latent profile analysis (LPA), we identified four clusters of individuals based on their scores on the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) among 1499 US participants. We then compared profiles across measures of positive psychology, psychopathology, and spirituality. Overall, we found support for the four profiles of mindfulness in the U.S. sample, replicating and extending findings from prior studies. In addition, the four profiles showed differential levels of previous experience with mindfulness, mind-body and meditative practice, and in positive psychology and spirituality measures. Specifically, the high-mindfulness profile appeared as the healthiest and most adjusted of the four profiles; the judgmental observing and nonjudgmental aware profile showed higher levels of anxiety, depression, and the lowest levels of well-being. By contrast, the average mindfulness displayed intermediate levels of adjustment, spirituality, and well-being. Spiritual and positive psychology outcomes among the nonjudgmentally aware and judgmental observing appeared mixed. In sum, mindfulness profiles are differentially associated with psychopathology, positive psychology, and spirituality.",

Methods A total of 88 participants were allocated to three conditions: MBSR training (n = 26), MSC training (n = 34), and control group (n = 28). Their levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, anxiety, and depression were measured at pre- and post-intervention. Results Compared to the control group, participants in the MBSR training showed significant improvements in mindfulness and reductions in anxiety and depression from pre to post. Participants in the MSC training, compared to the control group, reported significant increases in mindfulness and self-compassion. We observed that anxiety levels remained stable in the MSC group, while participants in the control group reported an increase in their scores over time. The reduction in depression scores observed among MSC participants did not differ, however, from that observed among members of the control group. Mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxiety scores presented similar trajectories in MBSR and MSC groups, while the MBSR group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in depression levels compared to the MSC group. Conclusions Incorporating these programs into the psychologists' training should be considered, as desirable skills such as mindfulness and self-compassion are enhanced.

The following parameters were assessed at baseline and posttreatment: parental stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, as well as general mindfulness, mindful parenting, and self-compassion. Each child's ADHD symptoms and behavioral/emotional symptoms were also measured.Results The MPP group showed significantly greater amelioration of parental stress (F = 8.79, p = .004, effect size d =0.44) compared with that of the TAU waitlist-control group after eight weeks. The MPP group also showed greater improvements in parental general mindfulness (F = 11.40,p < .001, effect size d = 0.56) and self-compassion (F = 17.83,p < .001, effect size d = 0.62), but not mindful parenting (F = 2.32, p = 0.131), compared to those of the TAU group. Improvements in general mindfulness and parental self-compassion mediated the effect of the Mindful Parenting Program on parental stress at posttreatment, with effect sizes of 0.46 and 0.46, respectively. For the MPP completers, improvements in general parental mindfulness, parental self-compassion, and mindful parenting correlated with improvements in their children's ADHD symptoms and behavioral symptoms. Correlation between the total practice times and outcome improvements was nonsignificant.Conclusions Our findings suggest that the Mindful Parenting Program may be effective for ameliorating parental stress among Chinese parents of children with ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Despite a growing literature supporting the salutary effects of mindfulness meditation on emotion regulation, the underlying mechanisms linking neural and subjective changes occurring during the actual practice of meditation with emotion regulatory effects observed after meditation remains virtually unexplored. The current study sought to address this gap in knowledge by testing the hypothesis that adoption of internally-directed focused attention, indexed by increased alpha and theta spectral power, during brief open monitoring (OM) mindfulness meditation predicts reduced emotional reactivity, as measured by the late positive potential (LPP). Results revealed that the OM meditation did not produce demonstrable differences in alpha and theta power but did increase self-reported sleepiness relative to controls. Follow-up analyses showed that sleepiness uniquely moderated the effect of meditation on the LPP, such that less sleepiness during meditation, but not the control audio, corresponded to smaller LPPs to negative images. Change in theta, but not alpha power, between meditation and rest was positively correlated with the LPP even after controlling for sleepiness. Although the primary hypothesis was unsupported, the findings demonstrate that phenomenological and neural changes occurring during OM meditation may modulate its subsequent \"off-the-cushion\" effects on emotional reactivity.",

The research plan was a semi-experimental design with a control group. Forty-four eligible young adults in Isfahan (Iran) enrolled in an MSC course. The participants consisted of 19 males (43%) and 25 females (57%) from 18 to 25 years old. They were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 24) and control (N = 23) groups. The experimental group participated in eight 2-h sessions of the MSC program. The results indicated that the experimental group showed a significant decrease in anxiety (p < .001), depression (p < .01), internal shame (p < .05), self-criticism (p < .000), and a significant increase in self-compassion (p < .01) compared to the control group in both post-test and follow-up.

Therefore, this study also focuses on the role of mindfulness-based therapies in alleviating anxiety and depression among Chinese university students. Method: For this purpose, \"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)\" therapy was taken into account. A total of 100 students were considered for this study. 50 of the students were incorporated in MBSR group while the remaining were included in control group. In this regard, the \"Affective Control Scale (ACS)\" was used for determining the anger, depression, anxiety and positive emotion among both groups. Results: The results obtained from this RCT showed that the positive emotion fear was less than the fear concerning depression, anger and anxiety. The incorporated MBSR therapy was found to be effective in decreasing anxiety and depression among university students in China (p < 0.001). Conclusion: As a result, different cognitive mechanisms (rumination, decentering and mindfulness) are found to be improved among such students.

The results showed that training had a positive effect on acceptance (t = -3.32, p = .00) and a negative effect on perceived stress (t = 3.57, p =.00), although it did not affect awareness significantly (t = .37, p = .77). It was also found that acceptance has a statistically significant full mediation on the relationship between training and perceived stress, with a negative indirect effect (a*b = -.26, Bootstrap CI95 = -.54 and -.02). Notably, awareness did not moderate the relationship between acceptance and perceived stress (b = -.31, t = -1.91, p > .05). The findings contribute to the literature from the perspectives of psychology and adult learning as it uses an experimental research design to investigate the underlying mechanism of the effect of MSC online training on perceived stress, critical in influencing a variety of behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Past research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions increase positive affect in non-clinical populations. However, the mechanisms underlying this increase are poorly understood. On the basis of previous empirical and theoretical accounts, we hypothesized that a decreased use of disengagement coping strategies in daily life would explain the benefits of a mindfulness-based intervention in terms of increased positive affect. We analysed the data of 75 healthy adult participants (58 women; 17 men) of different ages (M=49years old; SD=13; age range 19-81) who had been randomly allocated to 8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or to a waitlist control group. The results confirmed our hypothesis: Participants in the MBCT group showed significant improvements in positive affect compared to the control group, with decreased use of disengagement coping styles mediating these improvements. The implications of this study are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the effects of an online mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on postpandemic era nurses' subjective well-being, job burnout, and psychological adaptation. Previous studies on the psychological adaptability of nurses mainly focused on investigation rather than intervention. Ninety nurses were randomly classified into an intervention or control group. The intervention group received weekly online mindfulness-based stress reduction training for 8 weeks. The Subjective Well-being, Job Burnout, and Psychological Use scales were administered pre- and postintervention. Postintervention, nurses' positive emotions and life satisfaction significantly improved. Nurses' psychological adaptation was significantly higher postintervention than preintervention. The total scores for negative emotion, low personal accomplishment, and job burnout were significantly lower postintervention than preintervention. The scores for positive emotion and life satisfaction in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the scores for low personal accomplishment in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Online mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions can improve nurses' subjective well-being, reduce job burnout, and improve their level of psychological adaptability. Moreover, it could promote nurses' ability to communicate mindfully with patients and their families. This intervention could help promote the development of mindfulness in the nursing field.",

        "title": "Evaluating the feasibility and preliminary effects of an online compassion training program for nursing students: A pilot randomized controlled trial",
        "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of an online compassion training program for nursing students and preliminarily investigate its effects on mindfulness, self-compassion, and stress reduction. Methods: This study employed a randomized controlled trial design. Second-year students from a nursing college in Guangzhou, China, were recruited as research participants in August 2023. The intervention group participated in an 8-week online compassion training program via the WeChat platform, comprising three stages: mindfulness (weeks 1-2), self-compassion (weeks 3-5), and compassion for others (weeks 6 -8). Each stage included four activities: psychoeducation, mindfulness practice, weekly diary, and emotional support. Program feasibility was assessed through recruitment and retention rates, program engagement, and participant acceptability. Program effectiveness was measured with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Self-Compassion Scale - Short Form, and Perceived Stress Scale. Results: A total of 28 students completed the study (13 in the intervention group, 15 in the control group). The recruitment rate was 36.46%, with a high retention rate of 93.3%. Participants demonstrated high engagement: 69.2% accessed learning materials every 1-2 days, 93.3% practiced mindfulness at least weekly, with an average of 4.69 diary entries submitted per person and 23.30 WeChat interactions with instructors. Regarding acceptability, all participants expressed satisfaction with the program, with 92.4% finding it \"very helpful\" or \"extremely helpful.\" In terms of intervention effects, the intervention group showed a significant increase in mindfulness levels from pre-intervention (51.54 +/- 10.93) to postintervention (62.46 +/- 13.58) (P < 0.05), while no significant change was observed in the control group. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in post-intervention self-compassion and perceived stress levels, the intervention group showed positive trends: selfcompassion levels increased (35.85 +/- 8.60 vs. 40.85 +/- 5.54), and perceived stress levels slightly decreased (44.77 +/- 8.65 vs. 42.00 +/- 5.77). Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of an online compassion training program for nursing students and suggested its potential effectiveness in enhancing mindfulness, self-compassion, and stress reduction. Despite limitations such as small sample size and lack of long-term follow-up, preliminary evidence indicates promising prospects for integrating such training into nursing education. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings and assess the sustained impact of this approach on nursing education and practice.",

        "abstract": "Undergraduate and graduate students show elevated levels of stress and could thus benefit from mindfulness interventions, but the best way to teach mindfulness has not been established. The present study compared a stress management program that used formal meditations and informal practice (Mindful Stress Management; MSM) to one that used brief mindfulness exercises and informal practice (Mindful Stress Management-Informal; MSM-I), and a wait-list control. MSM participants exhibited significant within-group changes on all measures, and when compared to the wait-list control, greater levels of mindfulness, decentering, and self-compassion, as well as lower stress. Students in MSM-I had significant within-group changes on a subset of measures, and greater mindfulness and self-compassion compared to the wait-list. MSM participants showed more improvement in self-compassion, psychological inflexibility, and stress than did those in MSM-I. Mediational analyses found increases in one facet of mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreases in worry mediated reductions in stress for MSM participants, while no mediator reached significance for MSM-I. Finally, no significant relation between amount of formal meditation and informal practice and reductions in psychological distress or increases in mindfulness was found. Results suggest that a program with formal meditations and informal practice may be a more promising intervention for university student stress than one with brief mindfulness exercises and informal practice.",

        "title": "Construction and evaluation of a mindfulness-based quality of life and well-being program (MQW) in a randomized trial",
        "abstract": "Due to the multi-factorial nature of the self-report of happiness, an enhancement program was designed that focused on mental style (subjective processes), and relationships, work, money, health, and leisure (objective life domains). An examination of interventions revealed mindfulness training (subjective factors) and goal setting (objective factors) as effective change modalities. To address this, the Mindfulness-based Quality of Life and Well-being Program (MQW) was developed and evaluated against the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, Quality of Life Index, Personal Wellbeing Index-Adult, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, the Satisfaction with Life scale, and the newly developed Clinical Quality of Life Scale (CLINQOL). To explore training protocol effects, the program was delivered in a graduated (6 weekly sessions x 2 hours) and intensive (2 consecutive days x 6 hours) format. Using a randomized trial, participants were allocated across these conditions and a control. A total of 191 participants completed the study and were assessed at pre, post and follow up time points. Increases in mindfulness, quality of life, subjective well-being, and positive and negative affect (not life satisfaction), were greater in treated (combined formats) than control participants at post-test, and for mindfulness at follow up. Other than an increase in mindfulness for the 2 day condition at follow up, changes were similar in both intervention formats. Finally, to investigate what unique difference the MQW might have in comparison to teaching just mindfulness, the full version of the program was compared to an expanded section of the mindfulness component of the program. A total of 74 subjects began the program and filled out assessments across the three time periods. There was no difference between groups or an interaction between group and time. Overall, the findings provide preliminary evidence that a multi-dimensional training approach, using mindfulness and goal setting, may be a beneficial intervention model to enhance subjective and objective components in the perception of quality of life and well-being. However, further investigation into its added benefit to mindfulness alone is required.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Mother-infant attunement is fundamental to supporting infant socio-emotional development. Based on the assumption that we connect better with others if we are aware of and connected with our own experience, mindfulness could affect the maternal ability to attune to the infant. However, little is known about this topic in the first year of life. Study 1 aimed to investigate the role of maternal dispositional mindfulness and mindful parenting in mother-infant physiological and behavioral attunement at 3 months of age. Study 2 aimed to explore the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention not specific to parenting experience on mother-infant behavioral and physiological attunement and on maternal wellbeing at 9 months of age.Methods In Study 1, mother-infant (n = 67) behavioral and physiological attunement (i.e., co-regulation and RSA) were collected simultaneously each 20 s during face-to-face interaction. Mothers completed questionnaires about their dispositional mindfulness and mindful parenting. In Study 2, mother-infant dyads were randomly divided into a control (n = 20) and an intervention group (n = 29). The intervention group attended a 5-week mindfulness-based intervention. At T1 and T2, the same procedure described in Study 1 was applied and mothers reported about their wellbeing.Results Results showed that maternal mindfulness was associated with high physiological and behavioral attunement at 3 months and with more positive maternal behaviors and less stress at 9 months. Analysis evidenced a slight improvement in the intervention group in maternal dispositional mindfulness and a reduction in parenting stress at T2.Discussion Findings from both studies suggested that maternal mindfulness could represent a protective factor that could support mothers in fostering better dyadic interactions with their infants. The implementation of mindfulness-based interventions for mothers could have preventive and clinical implications.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Previous research has suggested Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) as being beneficial for people dealing with a variety of mental health issues in outpatient area. Method A clinical trial was conducted with 200 psychiatric inpatients testing the efficacy of a specially designed 6-week MSC program compared with a control intervention of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Each session lasted 75 min and took place once a week for each of the study groups. The primary end-point was the change in the self-compassion scale (SCS) total score from pre- to post treatment. Secondary end-points included changes in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18), and subjective feeling of happiness (single item). Results Of the 200 randomly assigned participants, the MSC group (M = 2.90, SD = 0.5) showed a significant improvement in SCS (F(1,198) = 25.57, p < .01, eta(2) = 0.11) after 6 weeks in comparison with the PMR group (M = 2.57, SD = 0.6, p > .05). Correspondingly, the MSC group stated a greater amount of happiness in comparison to the PMR group (p < .05). Furthermore, the GSI and SF-36 parameters improved in both study groups to the same extent during the 6-week treatment (p < .01). Conclusions These preliminary data suggest the clinical applicability of MSC in psychiatric patient groups, which merits further large-scale studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2001, more than 24000 solid-organ transplant surgeries were performed in the United States. Although survival rates have steadily risen over the past 2 decades, transplant recipients commonly experience a myriad of symptoms after transplantation that compromise quality of life. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia frequently occur despite excellent function of the transplanted organ. Use of complementary and alternative medicine has risen sharply over the past 10 years, particularly among people with chronic illnesses.METHODS: Twenty solid-organ transplant recipients were enrolled in a clinical trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction. During the 8-week course, subjects learned various forms of meditation and gentle hatha yoga. Participants were given audiotapes for home practice and maintained practice diaries. Longitudinal analysis focused on the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management, illness intrusion, and transplant-related stressors.RESULTS: Significant improvements in the quality and duration of sleep continued for 6 months after completion of the mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Improvements after the completion of the course were also noted in self-report measures of anxiety and depression.CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based stress reduction is an effective treatment in improving the quality and duration of sleep. Because sleep is highly correlated with positive mental health and overall well-being, these findings suggest that mindfulness-based stress reduction has the potential of being an effective, accessible and low-cost intervention that could significantly change transplant recipients' overall health and well-being.",

In this context, the ME approach is assumed to help modify maladaptive eating behaviors. This work investigated the effects of a brief ME intervention that focused on the non-judgmental awareness of different motivations to eat in order to study this mechanism.MethodUsing a randomized controlled trial design, participants were allocated to an intervention group (IG; n = 87) or waitlist control group (W-CG; n = 137). For a 2-week training phase, participants of the IG were instructed to take a mindful moment to rate their different motivations to eat once per day. Self-report data on emotional eating, external eating, and loss of control eating (primary outcomes) and intuitive eating, ME, mental well-being, and self-compassion (secondary outcomes) were gathered online pre, post, and 3 months after the training.

Method: The study was conducted with randomly assigned 19 female students attending to a public university in Turkey. The inclusion criteria were to have low scores on Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and Thriving Scale in pre-test assessment. Experimental group (n=10) received a 6-session MTP intervention developed by the first researcher while control group (n=9) received no intervention. To determine the immediate and long-term effects of the MTP, all participants completed post-tests two months after the program. Data were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA test.

        "abstract": "Contemplative approaches rooted in Buddhist traditions have been linked to the attenuation of response to social stress. Anticipatory cognitive appraisals of social situations potentially represent a mechanism explaining the stress-reducing effects of contemplative practices. The cognitive appraisal of threat is associated with an anticipated loss of social self-esteem. In contrast, the cognitive appraisal of challenge involves recognizing the potential for gain or growth in stressful situations and is associated with a more adaptive cardiovascular response. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled experiment performed in Switzerland, we evaluated the effects of two contemplative interventions on cognitive appraisals of challenge and threat and associated physiological profiles. The interventions were a standard Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program and a new program (MBSR-B), which included several elements from Buddhist practices. After an eight-week intervention, participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and underwent the assessment of primary cognitive appraisals and cardiovascular response to stress. The results demonstrated greater challenge appraisal in the MBSR (n = 20) and MBSR-B (n = 21) groups compared to Control (n = 24), and MBSR-B participants scored higher on the challenge than threat appraisal. At the physiological level, the groups did not differ on changes in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Still, an exploratory analysis demonstrated that the MBSR-B group's cardiovascular profile best resembled challenge appraisal. The results suggest that contemplative approaches foster challenge appraisal, contributing to a more adaptive response to stress.",

        "abstract": "Background: Health personnel are susceptible to high levels of work stress and burnout due to the psychological and emotional demands of their work, as well as to other aspects related to the organisation of that work. This paper describes the rationale and design of the MINDUUDD study, the aim of which is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness and self-compassion 4-session programme versus the standard 8-session programme to reduce work stress and burnout in Family and Community Medicine and Nursing tutors and residents.Methods: The MINDUDD study is a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms. Six Teaching Units will be randomised to one of the three study groups: 1) Experimental Group-8 (EG8); 2) Experimental Group-4 (EG4) Control group (CG). At least 132 subjects will participate (66 tutors/66 residents), 44 in the EG8, 44 in the EG4, and 44 in the CG. Interventions will be based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, including some self-compassion practices of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) programme. The EG8 intervention will be implemented during 8 weekly face-to-face sessions of 2.5 h each, while the EG4 intervention will consist of 4 sessions of 2.5 h each. The participants will have to practice at home for 30 min/day in the EG8 and 15 min/day in the EG4. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE), and Goldberg Anxiety-Depression Scale (GADS) will be administered. Measurements will be taken at baseline, at the end of the programs, and at three months after completion. The effect of the interventions will be evaluated by bivariate and multivariate analyses (Multiple Linear Regression).Discussion: If the abbreviated mindfulness programme is at least as effective as the standard program, its incorporation into the curriculum and training plans will be easier and more appropriate. It will also be more easily applied and accepted by primary care professionals because of the reduced resources and means required for its implementation, and it may also extend beyond care settings to academic and teaching environments as well.",

        "title": "The pursuit of euthymia",
        "abstract": "Psychiatrists often consider the positive characteristics displayed by a patient in their clinical judgment, yet current assessment and treatment strategies are shifted on the side of psychological dysfunction. Euthymia is a transdiagnostic construct referring to the presence of positive affects and psychological well-being, i.e., balance and integration of psychic forces (flexibility), a unifying outlook on life which guides actions and feelings for shaping future accordingly (consistency), and resistance to stress (resilience and tolerance to anxiety or frustration). There is increasing evidence that the evaluation of euthymia and its components has major clinical implications. Specific instruments (clinical interviews and questionnaires) may be included in a clinimetric assessment strategy encompassing macro-analysis and staging. The pursuit of euthymia cannot be conceived as a therapeutic intervention for specific mental disorders, but as a transdiagnostic strategy to be incorporated in an individualized therapeutic plan. A number of psychotherapeutic techniques aiming to enhance positive affects and psychological well-being (such as well-being therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy) have been developed and validated in randomized controlled clinical trials. The findings indicate that flourishing and resilience can be promoted by specific interventions leading to a positive evaluation of one's self, a sense of continuing growth and development, the belief that life is purposeful and meaningful, satisfaction with one's relations with others, the capacity to manage effectively one's life, and a sense of self-determination.",

However, the mechanisms through which CBIs produce these positive outcomes are not fully known. The amount of meditation practice in CBIs has been associated with the outcomes but the role of quality of practice has not yet been explored. Thus, in addition to examining the contribution of the Compassion Practice Quality Scale (CPQS) to predicting the main outcomes of a CBI (compassion cultivation training), the current study explored the scale's construct validity and sensitivity to change.Methods Data were drawn from a pretest-posttest study design (n = 74), and compassion practice quality, positive self-compassion, negative self-compassion, difficulties in emotion regulation, and body awareness were assessed.Results The CPQS was found to be a valid and reliable measure, showing pretest-posttest differences. Overall, CPQS baseline scores were positively associated with positive self-compassion and body awareness and negatively associated with negative self-compassion and difficulties in emotion regulation. Moreover, compassion practice quality explained a significant amount of variance in positive self-compassion (Delta R2 = .18, Delta F (4, 31) = 2.69, p = .049), after controlling for baseline positive self-compassion, previous meditation experience, and frequency of formal practice during the CBI.Conclusions The findings confirm the significance of compassion practice quality and the usefulness of the CPQS in compassion research. Future studies should continue to investigate the psychometric properties of the CPQS, describing the daily or weekly evolution of compassion practice and developing specific pedagogical strategies to foster compassion practice quality within CBIs.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Chemsex is a term used to describe sex acts using psychoactive substances to enhance the sexual experience/arousal and predominates among men who have sex with men (MSM). Chemsex drugs predominantly include gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and analogues, methamphetamine, mephedrone and erectile dysfunction agents (e.g., Sildenafil). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) combines cognitive therapy and mindfulness and has been shown to help support both sexual functioning and methamphetamine use. However, limited clinical trials have evaluated the use of cognitive mindfulness for chemsex in MSM. The present study assessed the effectiveness of an online mindfulness-based cognitive intervention (MBCI) among 29 MSM aged 18-30 years engaged in chemsex.Design and Setting: A mixed methods approach consisted of a randomised waitlist-controlled trial and a content analysis reviewing participants' feedback on MBCI. The design of the intervention was based on a behavioural taxonomy mapped to selected behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to support the reliability of MBCI in its delivery.Main Outcome MeasuresParticipants completed assessments measuring levels of chemsex, mindfulness, sexual self-efficacy and well-being, taken at Weeks 0, 8 and 12 (follow-up).Results: Participants reported lower levels of chemsex and higher levels of cognitive mindfulness, sexual self-efficacy and well-being postintervention and at the 12-week follow-up. The content analysis feedback responses yielded favourable outcomes, suggesting that participants developed a sense of self-compassion, confidence and positive identity.Conclusions: The MBCI effectively reduced chemsex; however, this study warrants replication with a larger, more diverse group of participants.",

        "abstract": "Solid organ and stem cell transplant patients and their caregivers report a substantial level of distress. Mindfulness-based stress reduction has been shown to alleviate distress associated with transplant, but there is limited experience in this population with other mindfulness-based interventions, or with combined transplant patient and caregiver interventions. We evaluated a novel, 6-week mindfulness-based resilience training (MBRT) class for transplant patients and their caregivers that incorporates mindfulness practice, yoga, and neuroscience of stress and resilience. Thirty-one heart, liver, kidney/pancreas, and stem cell transplant patients and 18 caregivers at Mayo Clinic in Arizona participated. Measures of stress, resilience, depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, positive and negative affect, and sleep were completed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months postintervention. At 6 weeks and 3 months, patients demonstrated significant (P<.005) improvements from baseline in measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Quality-of-life mental component (P=.006) and positive affect (P=.02) also improved at follow-up. Most participants adhered to the program, were satisfied with class length and frequency, and reported improved well-being as a result of the class. MBRT holds promise as an intervention to enhance resilience and manage stress for transplant patients and their caregivers.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychological treatment that might be beneficial for people with bipolar disorder (BD). Neurocognitive studies suggest that MBCT may have important effects on mood regulation and broad attentional and frontal-executive control in BD. In this qualitative study, the process of change of MBCT in people with BD is explored.Methods The current qualitative study was part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT for BD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 16 participants who participated in an 8-week MBCT. For reasons of triangulation, teachers were interviewed as well.Results Three themes arose from the data: (1) awareness of thoughts, emotions, bodily sensations, and behavior and insight into their inter-relationship; (2) behavioral change; and (3) positive consequences following MBCT. A distinction was made between general aspects and aspects related specifically to BD. Themes were divided into subthemes. Process of change took place in a non-linear, iterative fashion.Conclusions: Qualitative data support the notion that several cognitive and behavioral processes in BD could be potential targets for MBCT. We suggest that future mediation, neuroimaging, and cognitive experimental studies should explore MBCT as an adjunctive treatment strategy for BD by investigating possible working mechanisms of MBCT in BD.",

        "abstract": "Background Family carers of adults with learning disability and behaviours that challenge lead complex and stressful lives. Their caring role can leave them isolated and unsupported. In the UK, effective services designed to build resilience for people in long-term caring roles are lacking. There are none (to our knowledge) designed using a participatory health research (PHR) approach with family carers and professionals. Objective With positive behaviour support (PBS) and mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as key elements, a PHR approach was used to understand the basis for a successful course that supported the capabilities and resilience of family members in long-term caring roles. Design The research was guided by the principles of PHR with participation as the defining principle throughout. Central to the research were reflexive conversations (communicative spaces) where diverse knowledges were shared and critiqued. Findings Mindfulness/ACT can change long-standing response behaviours and build personal resilience and improve mental health. Elements enabling positive change included a facilitation approach for collaborative reflexivity and the complementary, interactive approach to collaborative enquiry for learning and decision making afforded by PHR. Discussion The use of PHR accessed knowledges that would have been lost to more traditional, professional-expert driven processes and facilitated change in constructs for action for both professionals and family carers. Findings challenge service providers to consider how experiential knowledge has agency in professional practice and service design. Reflection on the PHR process across the FaBPos project led to a re-consideration of quality issues in relation to PHR and participation.",

However, there is a need to identify the specific instructional strategies that will more consistently support positive embodiment and positive affect. We examined the effect of teaching a single yoga class using mindfulness-based instruction compared to appearance-based and neutral instruction alternatives on embodiment (i.e., state body surveillance, state body appreciation, pleasure during yoga) and changes in affect from before to after class. Female participants (N = 62; M-age = 23.89, SD = 6.86) were randomly assigned to a yoga class that emphasized: being mindfully present in one's body, changing one's appearance, or just getting into yoga poses. ANOVAs revealed significantly higher body surveillance (eta(2)(p) =.10) and lower forecasted pleasure (eta(2)(p) =.21) in the appearance class compared to the other two classes. Participants in the mindfulness class experienced greater improvement in affect (eta(2)(p) =.08) from before to after class and higher remembered pleasure during the yoga class (eta(2)(p) =.19) compared to those in the appearance class. Emphasizing changes to appearance in yoga instruction may place participants at risk for less positive affect and less positive experiences of embodiment compared to mindfulness-based or even neutral yoga instruction.",

        "abstract": "Changes in the health care environment, together with specific work-related stressors and the consequences on workers' health and performance, have led to the implementation of prevention strategies. Among the different approaches, those which are mindfulness-based have been institutionally recommended with an indication provided as to their effectiveness in the management of stress. The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of the mindfulness-based IARA Model((R)) (an Italian acronym translatable into meeting, compliance, responsibility, autonomy) in order to ameliorate perceived stress, anxiety and enhance emotional regulation among health care professionals (HCPs; i.e., doctors, nurses, and healthcare assistants). Four hundred and ninety-seven HCPs, 215 (57.2%) of which were women, were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based training or control group and agreed to complete questionnaires on emotion regulation difficulties (DERS), anxiety, and perceived stress. Results showed that HCPs who attended the IARA training, compared to the control group, had better emotional regulation, anxiety and stress indices after 6 months from the end of the intervention. Furthermore, the results confirmed the positive relationship between emotional regulation, perceived stress and anxiety. The present study contributes to literature by extending the effectiveness of IARA in improving emotional regulation and well-being in non-clinical samples. Moreover, the study provides support for the idea that some specific emotional regulation processes can be implicated in perceived stress and anxiety. From the application point of view, companies should invest more in stress management intervention, monitoring and training, in order to develop worker skills, emotional self-awareness, and relational resources.",

        "abstract": "Parents of children with developmental disabilities are more likely to report parental stress and depression. This, in turn, leads to vicious cycles of negative outcomes for these children and the family's well-being. To address the difficulties of such parents, the authors developed a brief mindfulness-based program for parents of children with developmental disabilities (six weekly sessions, nine total contact hours, and 10 min of daily home practice). A randomized control trial was designed to examine the effectiveness of the program, and 180 eligible parents were recruited and were allocated to intervention group and control group. The results showed that after completing the program, parents had significant improvements in parental stress (F[1, 176] = 4.76, p = .03), depression (F[1, 176] = 8.07, p = .01), and stress from parent-child dysfunctional interaction (F[1, 176] = 6.46, p = .01). Based on the pretest scores, parents with severe stress and depression reported more significant positive changes, and they reported moderate effect sizes of 0.62 for stress and 0.57 for depression, respectively. Participant satisfaction scores revealed that the parents were satisfied with the content and overall program arrangement, and agreed that their ability to cope with emotions and stress was enhanced. The results gave support to the program's feasibility. Future studies could further compare this brief program with a child behavior management program to investigate the outcomes and long-term benefits of this brief program.

The authors argue that attention may be an invaluable tool for promoting emotion regulation. Accordingly, they present evidence that selective attention to positive information reflects emotion regulation and that regulating attention is a critical component of the emotion regulatory process. Furthermore, attentional regulation can be successfully trained through repeated practice. The authors ultimately propose a model of attention training methodologies integrating attention-dependent emotion regulation strategies with attention networks. Although additional interdisciplinary research is needed to bolster these nascent findings, meditative practices appear to be among the most effective training methodologies in enhancing emotional well-being. Further exploration of the positive and therapeutic qualities of attention warrants the empirical attention of social and personality psychologists.",

The development of new preventive and intervention programs to support well-being in university students is a fundamental challenge for mental health professionals. We designed an 8-week online mindfulness-based program (eMBP) combining a face-to-face approach, text, audio, video components, and support psychotherapy principles with a unique intensive reminder system using the Facebook Messenger and Slack applications in two separate runs (N = 692). We assessed the program's effect on mindful experiencing, perceived stress, emotion regulation strategies, self-compassion, negative affect, and quality of life. The results of the presented pilot study confirmed that eMBP is a feasible and effective tool in university students' mental health support. The students who completed the eMBP reported a reduction of perceived stress with a large effect size ((p)eta(2) = 0.42) as well as a decrease of negative affect experience frequency and intensity ((p)eta(2) = 0.31), an increase of being mindful in their life (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire subscales:(p)eta(2) = 0.21, 0.27, 0.25, 0.28, 0.28), and a higher rate of self-compassion ((p)eta(2) = 0.28) with a medium effect size. A small effect size was found in the frequency of using a cognitive reappraisal strategy ((p)eta(2) = 0.073). One new result is the observation of an eMBP effect ((p)eta(2) = 0.27) on the decrease in attributed importance to the quality-of-life components replicated in two consecutive runs of the program.

The second aim was to gain feedback from those taking part, thus using their experiences to explore the challenges of introducing an MBI into a veterinary curriculum. By doing this, we aim to reflect and learn for future interventions. Qualitative feedback provided by participants of the MBI focus group was analyzed using thematic analysis and organized into two main themes: (1) \"Taking Part in the MBI and Beyond-What it Was Like and What Has the MBI Done for Me?\" and (2) \"Mindfulness for Veterinary Students-Reflections, Challenges, and Making it Happen.\" Experiences and outcomes of the MBI were positive.

        "abstract": "Aims. - The aim of this pilot comparative study was to compare the efficacy and the processes of two third wave psychotherapy interventions (a Mindfulness Based Intervention and a Positive Psychology Intervention) in the reduction of moderate to severe depression. Methods. - Twenty-seven patients (mean age = 44 years old) suffering from moderate to severe depression were recruited in a psychiatric clinic in the South -Est of France. They were randomized to either a Mindfulness Based Intervention (MBI; n = 10) or a Positive Psychology Intervention (PPI; n = 12) and compared to a Treatment As Usual (TAU; n = 5) group who benefited from psychoeducational and classical cognitive behavioral emotion regulation workshops. The interventions were based on existing validated mindfulness and positive psychology interventions (MBCT and CARE). Participants completed questionnaires before (T1), after (T2) and one month after the intervention (T3). These questionnaires measured depressive symptoms, hopelessness, well-being, authentic -sustainable happiness, psychological flexibility, procrastination, and attention orientation towards the positive aspects of life. These data were completed by qualitative data collected through semi -directed interviews at T2 in order to assess to what extent each participant had found the intervention useful and adapted to their needs. These interviews also assessed how much participants expressed motivation to continue the practices learnt. Results. - Participants showed reduced depressive symptoms and hopelessness, enhanced well-being, authentic -sustainable happiness, psychological flexibility, and attention orientation towards positive aspects of life at T2 in both interventions, which were maintained at T3. Procrastination significantly decreased at T2 only for the PPI group. The TAU control group only showed a significant increase in well-being at T2. The results from the semi -directed interviews underlined that the patients perceived the interventions as useful in terms of increased openness and self -kindness (MBI) as well as altruistic attitudes (PPI).<br /> Conclusion. - Although the interventions are distinct, the effects appear to be similar in terms of efficacy and mechanisms of action, apart from a greater behavioral activation in the PPI intervention. The mindfulness based intervention group intervention and the positive psychology group intervention carried out in this study appeared to be adapted to the patients and mostly positive psychology practices were reported to be easily used outside the sessions.

        "abstract": "Compassion-based interventions (CBIs) have been shown to be effective for increasing empathy and compassion, and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.",

Therefore, there is a need for an early intervention that is easily accessible and low in costs. The current study examined the effectiveness of an 8-session online mindful parenting training for mothers with elevated levels of parental stress.Methods: A total of 76 mothers were randomized into an intervention (n = 43) or a waitlist control group (n = 33). The intervention group completed pretest assessment prior to the online intervention. Participants completed a post intervention assessment after the 10 weeks intervention and a follow-up assessment 10 weeks later. The waitlist group completed waitlist assessment, followed by a 10-week waitlist period. After these 10 weeks, a pretest assessment took place, after which the waitlist group participants also started the intervention, followed by the posttest assessment. Participating mothers completed questionnaires on parental stress (parent-child interaction problems, parenting problems, parental role restriction) and other maternal (over-reactive parenting discipline, self-compassion, symptoms of depression and anxiety) and child outcomes (aggressive behavior and emotional reactivity) while the non-participating parents (father or another mother) were asked to also report on child outcomes.Results: The online mindful parenting intervention was shown to be significantly more effective at a 95% level than a waitlist period with regard to over-reactive parenting discipline and symptoms of depression and anxiety (small and medium effect sizes), and significantly more effective at a 90% level with regard to self-compassion, and mother-rated child aggressive behavior and child emotional reactivity (small effect sizes). The primary outcome, parental stress, was found to have a 95% significant within-group effect only for the subscale parental role restriction (delayed small effect size improvement at follow-up). No significant improvements on child outcomes were found for the non-participating parent.Conclusion: To conclude, the results provide first evidence that an online mindful parenting training may be an easily accessible and valuable intervention for mothers with elevated levels of parental stress.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence of COVID-19 has spurred a wide range of psychological morbidities. However, its influence on a vulnerable population with chronic conditions is less addressed. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychological health among patients with chronic diseases during the elevated psychiatric distress associated with the outbreak and examine the efficacy and feasibility of mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention (MBSR). The study involved 149 participants recruited from university hospital outpatient clinics. Patients were allocated into two groups: MBSR training program and control group. Standardized questionnaires were administered to assess depression, anxiety and stress prior to the MBSR program and at completion of the training after 8 weeks.ResultsThe results showed that MBSR intervention improved psychological distress and decreased the mean scores of depression, anxiety and stress.ConclusionsMindfulness training program based on audio and smartphone was feasible and effective when it was applied to patients with chronic diseases and showed positive impact on negative psychological stress domains. These findings pave the way for the integration of psychological support for patients with chronic illnesses in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to compare dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and positive psychotherapy (PPT) effects on perceived stress (PS) and quality of life (QOL) among patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Seventy six eligible patients with a Rome- IV diagnosis were randomly allocated in DBT (n = 18), MBCT (n = 20), PPT (n = 18), and control groups (n = 20). All the patients were evaluated for PS by perceived stress scale (PSS) and QOL by irritable bowel syndrome quality of life (IBS-QOL) on the studied groups at the time of their inclusion in the study and 8 weeks after it. Each of the intervention groups took part in 8 group sessions. Conversely, the control group were evaluated without any intervention. 46 female and 27 male in 4 groups completed the study. The results showed significant differences between the groups based on the variables of the PSS and IBS-QOL (p < 0.05). In addition, levels of PS were significantly lower for the MBCT intervention compared with the other groups; besides, the significant effects of the QOL variables represented the higher scores of the PPT compared to the treatment groups. The interventions could not be generalized to other samples. Some other limitations included the lack of conducting a follow-up plan. This study provides initial evidence that MBCT and PPT are more effective than other treatment groups on PS decrease and QOL improvement among patients with IBS, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The Mindfulness Based Flourishing Program (MBFP) is an online 8-week intervention developed for enhancing wellbeing with the use of mindfulness practices, through targeting a range of positive variables. The efficacy of the MBFP has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial, and in order to further establish it as an intervention with widespread application, cross-cultural validation is warranted. The current study was conducted with the primary aim of testing the validity of the MBFP with a Hong Kong Chinese population, as well as verifying its positive effects. A randomized wait-list controlled design was adopted with 115 participants (92 females, mean age=31.50). Intervention outcomes were compared between Hong Kong Chinese and British participants. Five positive variables were examined (self-compassion, meaning in life, positive and negative emotions, gratitude, and mindfulness), and measures were taken pre- and post-intervention. Significant gains in wellbeing measures were observed in both the Hong Kong Chinese and the British experimental groups. Levels of wellbeing post-intervention were also higher for the two experimental groups as compared to their control counterparts. The current study provides preliminary evidence for the MBFP's cross-cultural validity, and strengthens previous claims for its efficacy as a new, accessible alternative for enhancing wellbeing.",

This study investigated the role of mindfulness in strengths development, directly comparing the effects of mindfulness-based strengths practice (MBSP) and a form of CSBI without mindfulness. Ninety-five participants were randomly assigned to MBSP, CSBI, and blank control groups. Participants' mindfulness, character strengths, strengths knowledge, strengths use, psychological well-being (PWB), and subjective well-being (SWB) were assessed before and after the intervention, and one month later. The results showed that MBSP and CSBI were equally effective in enhancing character strengths, strengths knowledge, and strengths use. MBSP was more effective in promoting mindfulness, PWB, and overall character strengths, while CSBI was more effective in enhancing participants' SWB. The development of strengths knowledge and strengths use served as serial mediators of the increase in character strengths, and the development of mindfulness served as the mediator of the increase in PWB.",

In the study, a randomized control group pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test design was used. The study group consisted of 60 students (30 in an experimental group and 30 in a control group) continuing their education in different faculties of a foundation university during the Covid-19 pandemic in Turkey. A personal information questionnaire, Psychological Well-Being Scale and Life Satisfaction Scale were used to collect the study data. The Mindfulness-Based Physical Exercise Program was implemented in the experimental group, once a week for 8 sessions. The results suggested significant differences between the psychological well-being and life satisfaction post-test scores of the experimental and control groups in favor of the experimental group. In the sub-dimensions of psychological well-being, significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups in post-test scores of environmental mastery, personal growth, and purpose in life. There was no significant difference between the psychological well-being, positive relationships with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance sub-dimensions except personal growth sub-dimensions, and life satisfaction post-test and follow-up test scores of the university students in the experimental group. In the post-test comparisons of two groups, a significant difference was found between total psychological well-being, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, and self-acceptance, in favor of the experimental group.",

We also explored how the nurses felt about the practical and technical aspects of the intervention. Design: Qualitative interview study. Method: Individual interviews were conducted with eight of the 56 participants in the intervention study and used phenomenological analysis to illuminate how they made sense of their lived experiences of mindfulness training. Findings: Three themes illuminated the nurses' experiences: becoming aware, changing through mindfulness, and gaining the tools for mindfulness through workshops and the mobile application. The first two themes expressed personal experiences, whereas the third expressed experiences of the practical and technical aspects of the intervention. Most nurses found the mobile application easy to use and effective. Conclusions: Emergency care nurses can feel that the awareness and changes that come with mindfulness training benefit them, their colleagues, and the patients for whom they care. The findings also provide insights into the challenges of practicing mindfulness in a busy emergency care setting and into the practical aspects of using a smartphone application to train mindfulness.",

        "abstract": "Increases in mindfulness are assumed to lead to improvements in psychological well-being during mindfulness-based treatments. However, the temporal order of this association has received little attention. This intensive longitudinal study examines whether within-person changes in mindfulness precede or follow changes in negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) during a mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) program. This study also examines interindividual differences in the association between mindfulness and affect and possible predictors of these differences. Mindfulness, NA, and PA were assessed on a daily basis in 83 individuals from the general population who participated in an MBSR program. Multilevel autoregressive models were used to investigate the temporal order of changes in mindfulness and affect. Day-to-day changes in mindfulness predicted subsequent day-to-day changes in both NA and PA, but reverse associations did not emerge. Thus, changes in mindfulness seem to precede rather than to follow changes in affect during MBSR. The magnitude of the effects differed substantially between individuals, showing that the strength of the relationship between mindfulness and affect is not the same for all participants. These between-subjects differences could not be explained by gender, age, level of education, average level of mindfulness home practice, or baseline levels of mindfulness and affect. Mindfulness home practice during the day did predict subsequent increases in mindfulness. The findings suggest that increasing mindfulness on a daily basis can be a beneficial means to improve daily psychological well-being.",

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on promoting PTG, decreasing perceived stress and anxiety of Chinese BC patients. A randomized controlled trial of 60 BC patients (Stages I-III) was conducted. They were randomly divided to the 8-week MBSR group or usual care (UC) group. PTG inventory, Perceived Stress Scale of Chinese version (CPSS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) evaluated the PTG level, perceived stress and anxiety at three times(before intervention-T1, after intervention-T2 and follow up at 3 months-T3). A repeated-measures analysis of variance model was used to compare each outcome measure of two groups at the three times. There was one patient discontinued the intervention and one lose to follow up in MBSR group, finally 58 BC patients completed the research. There was no difference between two groups before the intervention. The results showed significant improvements in MBSR group comparing with the UC group that PTG level was much higher after the 8-week intervention and the follow up (F = 34.73, p<.00). At the same time, CPSS (F = 14.41, p<.00) and STAI (F = 15.24, p<.00) scores were significant decreased at T2 and T3. The results showed that MBSR promoted the level of PTG and decreased perceived stress and anxiety state of Chinese BC patients, and the results persisted at three months after intervention. The research preliminary proved that MBSR was suitable to Chinese BC patients. MBSR should be recommending to BC survivors in China.",

        "abstract": "Objective Mindfulness-based interventions target novel pain relief mechanisms not captured by legacy pain scales, including 1) cultivating awareness of pleasant and neutral sensations proximal to unpleasant sensations and 2) interoceptively mapping sensation location and spatial distribution. Methods We created a digital sensation manikin (SM) by overlaying a human figure silhouette with a grid of 469 \"sensation\" pixels. A series of five research questions examined the SM's discriminant validity, construct validity, incremental validity, convergence with an objective measure of pain attentional bias, and sensitivity to a mindfulness-based psychological treatment, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE). A sample of opioid treated chronic pain patients (n = 108; age, 53.79 (12.94) years; female, 65%) was recruited to answer research questions 1 to 5, and a sample of healthy controls (n = 91; age, 36.47 (13.50) years; female, 55%) was recruited as the comparison group for research question 1. Results Chronic pain patients reported significantly more unpleasant sensations than did healthy controls (p < .001, d = 1.23) and significantly fewer pleasant sensations (p = .001, d = 0.50). The SM also evidenced expected relationships with multiple measures of pain (r = 0.26-0.29) and well-being (r = -0.21 to 0.28), uniquely predicted pain interference (beta = -0.18), and exhibited a significant association with pain attentional bias (r = 0.25). Finally, mindfulness-based intervention via MORE significantly increased the ratio of pleasant to unpleasant sensations reported by chronic pain patients relative to an active control condition (p = .036, d = 0.51). Conclusions This study supports the SM's validity and indicates that assessing both pleasant and unpleasant sensations broadens the scope of pain measurement. Although the SM would benefit from further optimization, its continued use is likely to contribute to improved assessment and treatment options for chronic pain patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: Interpersonal sensitivity is a prominent mental health problem facing college students today. Trait mindfulness is a potential positive factor that may influence interpersonal relationships. However, the precise relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity remains elusive, which limits the optimization and further application of mindfulness-based intervention schemes targeting interpersonal sensitivity. This study aimed to explore (a) whether negative emotions mediate the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity and (b) whether the relationship among trait mindfulness, negative emotions, and interpersonal sensitivity is moderated by effectiveness/authenticity. We hypothesize that (a) negative emotions mediate the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity, and (b) effectiveness/authenticity moderates the indirect association between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity through negative emotions.Methods: One thousand four hundred nineteen Chinese college students (1,023 females, 396 males), aged from 17 to 23 (SD = 0.86, mean = 18.38), participated in this study. Their trait mindfulness, negative emotions, the effectiveness/authenticity, and interpersonal sensitivity were measured using well-validated self-report questionnaires.Results: Correlational analyses indicated that both trait mindfulness and effectiveness/authenticity were significantly and negatively associated with interpersonal sensitivity. Mediation analyses uncovered a partial mediating role of negative emotions in the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity. Moderated mediation analyses showed that in college students with high effectiveness/authenticity, the relationship between trait mindfulness and negative emotions was stronger, whereas the relationship between negative emotions and interpersonal sensitivity was weaker.Conclusion: Negative emotion is a mediator of the relationship between trait mindfulness and interpersonal sensitivity, which in turn is moderated by effectiveness/authenticity. These findings suggest a potential mechanism through which trait mindfulness influences interpersonal sensitivity. Mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to decrease interpersonal sensitivity and offer a basis for predicting individual differences in response to mindfulness-based interventions among individuals.",

All the groups received the same Physical Activity program. The Mindfulness condition group received daily training in the form of pre-recorded sessions while the Implementation group elaborated their specific plans once a week. Mobility, fatigue, and the impact of the disease on the patient's life were measured. Two measurement times are carried out in pre-post intervention, at baseline and after eight weeks.Results: Overall, after 8 weeks intervention, results show that there was a significant increase in Walking distance in the three groups. In addition, the within-group analysis showed a statistically significant improvement between pre and post intervention on the physical component of the Disease Impact scale in the Implementation Intention group (p = 0.023) with large effect size, in the Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (p = 0.008) with a medium effect size and in the control group (p = 0.028) with small effect size.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have experienced a remarkable development of studies among childhood and adolescent interventions. For this reason, dispositional mindfulness (DM) measures for children and adolescents have been developed to determine the effectiveness of MBI at this age stage. However, little is known about how key elements of DM (for example, cognitive de/fusion or experiential avoidance that both confirm psychological inflexibility) are involved in the mechanisms of the children and adolescents' mental health outcomes. This research examined the mediating effect of cognitive fusion between DM and anxiety and other negative emotional states in a sample of 318 Spanish primary-school students (aged between 8 and 16 years, M = 11.24, SD = 2.19, 50.8% males). Participants completed the AFQ-Y (Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for youth), which is a measure of psychological inflexibility that encompasses cognitive defusion and experiential avoidance; CAMM (DM for children and adolescents), PANAS-N (positive and negative affect measure for children, Spanish version of PANASC), and STAIC (an anxiety measure for children). The study accomplished ethical standards. As MBI relevant literature has suggested, cognitive defusion was a significant mediator between DM and symptoms of both negative emotions and anxiety in children and adolescents. However, experiential avoidance did not show any significant mediating relationship. Probably, an improvement of the assessment of experiential avoidance is needed. MBI programs for children and adolescents may include more activities for reducing effects of the cognitive defusion on their emotional distress.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis is a gynecological disease that involves a broad biopsychosocial compromise with the potential to create a negative vicious cycle. Despite the complexity of factors influencing women's improvement, most interventions investigated target just the peripheral nociceptive sources of endometriosis-related pain. An alternative is intervening in self-regulation, which can potentially influence multiple domains of the illness experience. The present study examines the effect of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention (bMBI) on attention and autonomic nervous system regulation in women with endometriosis-related pain. Also, explore the interaction between these self-regulation domains and the affective pain dimension. An exploratory analysis of the secondary outcomes of a pilot randomized controlled trial was performed. The vagally-mediated Heart Rate Variability (vmHRV) at rest, cognitive stress, and recovery was employed to measure autonomic regulation. The Flanker and Stroop tasks were used to estimate the attention domains. Results showed that bMBI (n = 26) significantly improved Flanker accuracy and Flanker and Stroop reaction time compared to the control group (n = 28). bMBI significantly increased vmHRV at rest and recovery after cognitive stress. Attention mediated the bMBI effect on affective pain improvement. Results suggest that bMBI improves self-regulation domains with the potential to develop a broad biopsychosocial benefit in the endometriosis context.Perspective: This article demonstrates the positive impact of a brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention on attention and parasympathetic regulation in women suffering from endometriosisrelated pain. This mindfulness-induced self-regulation improvement can benefit affective pain and potentially multiple psychophysiological processes relevant to endometriosis.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc",

MBSR group showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms at both V2 (p=0.03) and V3 (p=0.0461) compared to the baseline. There was a minimal effect on cognition - a group comparison analysis showed better psychomotor speed in the MBSR group compared to the control group at V2 (p=0.0493) but not at V3. There was a detectable change in immunological profiles in both groups, more pronounced in the MBSR group. Participants checked only positive/neutral answers concerning the attractivity/length of MBSR intervention. More severe cognitive decline (PVLT=36) was associated with the lower adherence to home practice.Conclusion: MBSR is well-accepted potentially promising intervention with positive effect on cognition, depressive symptoms and immunological profile.",

        "abstract": "Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) was first practiced by Buddhists and then developed by clinical psychologist. Previous studies on LKM have mainly focused on the impact of real person-guided meditation on depression, anxiety, and other negative psychology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explored the effect and mechanism of media-guided LKM on the improvement of social presence, mindfulness, spirituality, and subjective wellbeing (SWB). From the viewpoint of positive psychology, this study compared the different media effects of animated pedagogical agent (APA)-guided LKM and audio-guided LKM. A total of 82 flight attendants were recruited from airlines; then, they were randomly assigned to two groups: APA group (41 participants) and audio group (41 participants), which both underwent an 8-week LKM training intervention. The aforementioned four main variables were measured pre and post the meditation experiment. The results indicated that both APA-guided meditation and audio-guided meditation significantly improved subjects' spirituality and SWB. Compared with audio-guided meditation, APA-guided meditation significantly improved the subjects' spirituality, SWB, and social presence. Audio-guided meditation has no significant effect on social presence. This study highlights APA-guided meditation has a positive effect on spirituality, SWB, and social presence, which may provide individuals with a simple and easy method to improve their mental health.",

        "title": "The effects of a mindfulness-based lifestyle program for adults with Parkinson's disease: a mixed methods, wait list controlled randomised control study",
        "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative disease in developed countries. Current treatment for PD is pharmacologically focused and can have significant side-effects. There is increasing interest in holistic approaches including mindfulness to help manage the challenges associated with living with PD. We hypothesised that there would be an improvement in PD associated function and wellbeing in participants after participating in a 6-week mindfulness-based lifestyle program, and that these improvements would be sustainable at 6 months. Our primary objective was to determine changes in function and wellbeing associated with PD.Methods: An exploratory prospective, mixed-method, randomised control trial incorporating a before and after design with a waitlist control, with an embedded qualitative component was conducted in 2012-2013. Participants included community living adults with disability congruent to H&Y Stage 2 PD, aged 18-75, fluent in spoken and written English and able to attend at least four of six sessions of the program. Participants were randomised to the intervention or wait-list control groups at two locations. All participants in the wait-list control group eventually received the intervention. Two randomisation codes were created for each location. Allocation to the intervention or wait-list control was by random number generation. The program facilitator and participants were blinded to participant data.Results: Group 1 included 35 participants and group 2 (the waitlist control), 37. Data was analysed from 24 (group 1) and 33 (group 2) participants. The intervention group, compared to the waitlist control, showed a small improvement in function and wellbeing associated with PD immediately after the program (t-score = -0. 59) and at 6-month post intervention (t-score = -1.42) as reported by the PDQ-39 SI. However this finding was not significant (p = 0.56 and 0.16 respectively). A small yet significant effect size (beta = 0.23) in PDQ-39 ADL was reported in group 1 after 6-months post-intervention. This showed a positive improvement in the ADL as reported by group 1 after 6-months (t-score -1.8, p = 0.04). Four secondary measures are reported.Conclusions: Our findings suggest mindfulness-based lifestyle programs have potential to assist participants in managing the ongoing difficulties associated with a neurological condition such as Parkinson's disease. Importantly, our study shows promise for the long term benefits of such programs. Improvements to participant activities in daily living and mindfulness were retained at 6-months post intervention. A more definitive study should be conducted in a larger sample of PD patients to further explore these findings and their impact on reducing stress and anxiety in PD patients.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness interventions were shown to be effective in improving well-being and reducing perceived stress in several conditions. These effects were also found in online mindfulness-based training, especially in employees in organizational environments. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of an online mindfulness intervention on healthy employees, especially after the first Italian Covid-19 lockdown. Participants in the intervention group underwent an 8-week mindfulness online training program based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocol compared to a control (no-intervention) group. All participants filled in weekly surveys for the whole intervention duration via online questionnaires to measure their habits, mindfulness (FFMQ-15), emotion regulation (ERQ), positive and negative affect (PANAS), depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21), resilience (RSA) and insomnia (ISI). 69 participants in the intervention group and 63 in the no-treatment control group were considered in the longitudinal analyses. We found significant differences between the intervention and control groups over time in the measures of mindfulness (in particular the nonreactivity subscale), positive affect, depression, and insomnia. Moreover, we found that the frequency of practice and ease perceived in practicing were positively correlated to several indices of well-being (mindfulness, positive affect, cognitive reappraisal) and negatively correlated to several indices of stress (negative affect, depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, expressive suppression). These results show the importance and effectiveness of online mindfulness training programs to cope with stress among employees, especially after the Covid-19 lockdown.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Early Buddhist thought clearly recognizes the need for learning how to face one's own mortality, for which purpose mindfulness practice has a central role to play. Fear of death has also been studied in cognitive psychology, leading to what is known as the terror management theory. Actual research evidence in psychology has already shown that mindfulness practice may reduce fear and anxiety in general. However, there is a lack of research examining the specific effects of brief mindfulness practices on the fear of death and dying. In this study we tested the hypothesis that brief mindfulness practices used daily over a period of 6 weeks will result in a reduction of the fear of death and dying when compared to brief contemplative practices used as an active control condition.Methods Participants (n = 89) were randomly assigned to the mindfulness (n = 44) and the contemplation (n = 45) conditions and completed validated scales measuring four distinct fears related to either the process of dying or the final event of death (dying of oneself, death of oneself, dying of others, and death of others), mindfulness, and self-compassion at baseline, post-intervention (at 6 weeks) and follow up (1-3 weeks after the end of the 6-week intervention). ANOVA was used to investigate the effects of both interventions on outcome variables over time and between groups.Results Both mindfulness and contemplative practices were equally effective in reducing fear related to dying of oneself and death of others while increasing fear of dying of others, mindfulness, and self-compassion. No significant intervention effects were found for fear related to death of oneself only.Conclusions These results suggest that fears related to dying of oneself and death of others can be reduced using both mindfulness and contemplative practices that may simultaneously increase mindfulness and self-compassion.",

        "abstract": "Social, emotional, and behavioral problems present many issues and concerns for youth, families, and schools. Schools have adopted various frameworks of prevention and intervention meant to assist with such concerns. Two widely used frameworks are positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) and social-emotional learning (SEL). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness, implementation fidelity, and social validity of an integrated approach (PBIS + SEL) at Tier 2 in relation to students' prosocial classroom behavior. This was done using a common PBIS intervention, check-in/check-out (CICO), in conjunction with a common SEL intervention, mindful breathing (MB). Results suggest that CICO and CICO + MB may both be effective, feasible, and socially valid strategies for increasing prosocial classroom behavior and reducing externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in youth. More specifically, the MB component may produce small but additional valued outcomes compared to CICO alone. Future research should further investigate this value-added effect of MB when used with CICO for social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes as well as other possible methods of integration at Tier 2.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness based therapies (MBTs) for eating disorders show potential benefit for outcomes yet evidence is scarce regarding the mechanisms by which they influence remission from symptoms. One way that mindfulness approaches create positive outcomes is through enhancement of emotion regulation skills. Maladaptive emotion regulation is a key psychological feature of all eating disorders. The aim of the current study was to identify facets of emotion regulation involved in the relationship between mindfulness and maladaptive eating behaviours. In three cross-sectional studies, clinical (n=39) and non-clinical (n=137 and 119) female participants completed: 1) the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) eating specific scales (drive-for-thinness and bulimia) and the EDI psychological symptom scales (emotion dysregulation and interoceptive deficits); and 2) mindfulness, impulsivity, and emotion regulation questionnaires. In all samples mindfulness was significantly and inversely associated with EDI eating and psychological symptom scales, and impulsivity. In non-clinical samples interoceptive deficits mediated the relationship between mindfulness and EDI eating specific scales. Non-acceptance of emotional experience, a facet of interoceptive awareness, mediated the relationship between mindfulness and eating specific EDI scores. Further investigations could verify relationships identified so that mindfulness based approaches can be optimised to enhance emotion regulation skills in sufferers, and those at risk, of eating disorders.",

Therefore, a new program (M*E; Mindfulness para Entrenadores) was designed and implemented online for 6 weeks for coaches, support staff, and technical directors. Participants were 58 (57 men), aged between 23 and 58 (M = 31.8). The between-subject analysis (RM ANOVA 2*2) included experimental (n = 26) and wait-list control group (n = 21). A total of 29 completed the within-subject analysis (RM ANOVA) completing follow-up measurements until six months. The analysis was complemented with 21 individual semi-structured interviews. The experimental group showed significant improvements in mindfulness trait (p < .001), interpersonal mindfulness (p = .010), and a significant improvement in emotional regulation (p = .010) in comparison to the wait-list control group. The experimental group's positive trend in all variables' levels was maintained until six months after the program. The qualitative analysis showed a positive impact on professional, personal, and social areas with improvements related to performance and well-being. Several participants considered the program as \"fundamental\" for their professional role. This study provides information on best practices in implementing mindfulness-based programs, highlighting their practical orientation, the training plan, and the safe space. These results offer initial validation of the potential of the M*E and invite sports organizations to incorporate mindfulness-based programs specially designed for coaches, support staff and technical directors.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Traditional, 8-week, mindfulness-based interventions can effectively treat chronic pain, but require a time and resource investment too burdensome for many patients and providers. The solution to this logistical challenge may be to distill the core, therapeutic elements of an efficacious 8-week, mindfulness-based intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), into a 2-h, single-session intervention. Methods: In this study, the authors conducted a waitlist-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the impact of a 2-h, single-session adaptation of MORE (i.e., One MORE) on chronic pain patients' (N = 40) pain-related outcomes through 3-month follow-up. Results: Results indicated that One MORE significantly improved chronic pain patients' pain catastrophizing (i.e., primary outcome; F = 9.97, p = 0.002), pain intensity (F = 26.58, p < 0.001), pain interference (F = 39.43, p < 0.001), physical function (F = 16.29, p < 0.001), sleep (F = 16.66, p < 0.001), anxiety (F = 12.54, p < 0.001), and depression (F = 17.48, p < 0.001). One MORE also significantly increased theoretically indicated therapeutic mechanisms through the 3-month follow-up: mindfulness, positive reappraisal, savoring, self-transcendence. Discussion: Study results are promising, and if replicated, would suggest that One MORE is a highly scalable, low-cost (e.g., sustainable), nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic pain.

A convenience sample of full-time students at a public university was recruited for a 5-week study conducted mostly using an online platform. Participants were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT) intervention or a Neutral Clay Task (NCT). Anxiety, perceived stress, and salivary cortisol outcomes were measured. A total ofn= 77 participants completed the study. The MBAT group experienced significant reductions in anxiety and perceived stress compared to the NCT group. Significant reductions in salivary cortisol were observed, but only time could be identified as a confounding variable. Art making alone is not enough to induce significant positive responses, but this study suggests MBAT can, and that an online intervention could offer feasible and accessible mental health services on college campuses. Further refinement of biological data collection and analysis is needed to determine what the mediating effects MBAT could have, if any, at the molecular level.",

However, social functioning deficits have been unresponsive to current treatments.Aims: The study aims were to: i) describe the theoretical basis and therapeutic targets of a novel intervention targeting social functioning in UHR young people; and ii) examine its acceptability, safety and preliminary effect on social functioning.Methods: An international, multidisciplinary team developed a new intervention (MOMENTUM) to improve social functioning in UHR young people. MOMENTUM blends two novel approaches to social recovery: strengths and mindfulness-based intervention embedded within a social media environment, and application of the self-determination theory of motivation. The acceptability and safety of MOMENTUM were tested through a 2-month pilot study with 14 UHR participants.Results: System usage was high, with over 70% of users being actively engaged over the trial. All participants reported a positive experience using MOMENTUM, considered it safe and would recommend it to others. 93% reported it to be helpful. There were large, reliable improvements in social functioning (d = 1.83. p < 0.001) and subjective wellbeing (d = 0.75, p = 0.03) at follow-up. There were significant increases in the mechanisms targeted by the intervention including strengths usage (d = 0.70, p = 0.03), mindfulness skills (d = 0.66, p = 0.04) and components of social support.

        "abstract": "Peer navigators (PNs), including trained cancer survivor volunteers, can be an important resource to the cancer care team in reducing barriers to screening, treatment, and psychosocial care among underserved communities through their roles in outreach, education, advocacy, and peer support. As cancer centers face growing patient demand and evidence for integrating complementary therapies into conventional care, opportunities to envision new roles for PN arise. Based on psychosocial assessments conducted at an academic cancer center serving the low-income population of Bronx, NY, we found strong interest in both providing (44 %) and receiving (76 %) peer support, as well as in (76 %) mind-body practices (e.g., meditation). In research, these mind-body modalities and peer support have both been found to improve many aspects of physical and emotional outcomes in cancer patients, but none has looked at PNs as a potential resource for delivering such mind-body interventions. Towards this end, we conducted two pilot studies to train PN from an onsite peer navigation program called the BOLD Buddy Program, to deliver a well-defined, easy to learn, and culturally-aligned mind-body practice, i.e., Loving Kindness (LK) Meditation, to each other and to patients. Incorporating comparison to professional meditation instructors, our pilot work demonstrated that peer-lead LKM was associated with benefits to emotional well-being, relaxation, satisfaction, and perceived usability and that PNs were equally well-received in delivering LK as their professional counterparts. Evaluating 8 domains of feasibility using standardized measures, we were able to demonstrate that peer-lead LK was: in demand, acceptable, implementable, practical, adaptable, adoptable, expandable, and promising in efficacy.",

We describe the feasibility and acceptability of Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA), a culturally grounded intervention developed to prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Latina immigrants. We also compare participation in the intervention in-person with an online adaptation developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: ALMA was developed through several years of formative research in collaboration with community organizations serving Latino immigrants. The curriculum integrates mindfulness-based approaches with Latino cultural strengths to reduce stress, enhance coping strategies, and increase social support. Latina immigrant women who spoke Spanish were recruited from Latino serving organizations to participate in an intervention trial. The program consisted of eight sessions offered weekly in person to groups of similar to 20 Latina immigrants. After the onset of the pandemic, the program was adapted to be delivered online via zoom. Attendance and fidelity were monitored by intervention staff, and a satisfaction survey was given to participants post-intervention.Results: We enrolled 226 Latina immigrant women with an average age of 40 years and an average of 15.0 years living in the United States.

Mindfulness-based interventions have been developed for stress reduction in a variety of health contexts, including pregnancy. These interventions provide strategies that may help new mothers handle the physical, emotional, and relationship challenges of the postpartum period and increase acceptance of postpartum physical changes and body image. Limited research has explored whether women use skills learned in prenatal mindfulness classes for the postpartum experience and parenting. The purpose of this study was to explore women's experience with mindfulness in the year after childbirth.MethodsTwelve women who participated in a Mindfulness for Childbirth and Parenting course during pregnancy were interviewed between 2 and 16 months postpartum. The semistructured interview guide included questions on how participants may have used mindfulness to approach a variety of positive and negative postpartum experiences. Qualitative description methodology guided the research team to code the transcripts independently.

        "abstract": "Recent research suggests that mindfulness benefits emotion regulation and smoking cessation. However, the mechanisms by which mindfulness affects emotional and behavioral functioning are unclear. One potential mechanism, lower affective volatility, has not been empirically tested during smoking cessation. This study examined longitudinal associations among mindfulness and emotional responding over the course of smoking cessation treatment among predominantly low-socioeconomic status (SES) African American smokers, who are at high risk for relapse to smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Participants (N = 399, 51% female, mean age = 42, 48% with annual income <$ 10,000) completed a baseline measure of trait mindfulness. Negative affect, positive affect, and depressive symptoms were assessed at five time points during smoking cessation treatment (up to 31 days postquit). Volatility indices were calculated to quantify within-person instability of emotional symptoms over time. Over and above demographic characteristics, nicotine dependence, and abstinence status, greater baseline trait mindfulness predicted lower volatility of negative affect and depressive symptoms surrounding the quit attempt and up to 1 month postquit, ps < 0.05. Although volatility did not mediate the association between greater mindfulness and smoking cessation, these results are the first to show that mindfulness is linked to lower affective volatility (or greater stability) of negative emotions during the course of smoking cessation. The present study suggests that mindfulness is linked to greater emotional stability and augments the study of mindfulness in diverse populations. Future studies should examine the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on volatility and whether lower volatility explains effects of mindfulness-based treatments on smoking cessation.",

Although teachers did not perceive a decrease in job demands after the training, they felt more mindful and lowered their organizational commitment. Their mental health improved and their dedication during work increased. These findings may suggest that enhanced mindfulness enabled them to mentally disengage from work during their leisure time, which allowed them to experience fewer symptoms of psychological strain.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness-informed interventions (MIIs) are increasingly common but have not been extensively studied among families with elevated levels of risk (e.g., those involved in child protective services and/or receiving financial assistance). These families often experience high rates of stressors that can impact coping strategies, interpersonal dynamics, and relationships. Given that mindfulness has been shown to promote health and wellbeing, this study used a sample from two pilot randomized controlled trials to test the extent to which a mindfulness-informed intervention improved coping strategies and perceptions of children's behavior among 53 families with elevated risk. A principal components analysis with a direct oblimin rotation revealed that cognitive-emotion coping strategies could be characterized by three factors: positive adaptation, negative adaptation, and positive refocusing. Intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant group by time differences, with intervention participants demonstrating improvements in positive refocusing coping, positive adaptation coping, and perceptions of children's behavior problems compared to participants in the waitlist control group. No significant differences were found for negative adaptation coping strategies. Findings provide preliminary support for the benefits of mindfulness training in a sample generally underrepresented in the mindfulness intervention literature.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Mindfulness-based interventions for health professionals have been linked to improvements in burnout, well-being, empathy, communication, patient-centered care, and patient safety, but the optimal formats and intensity of training have been difficult to determine because of the paucity of studies and the heterogeneity of programs. A 4-days residential \"Mindful Practice\" workshop for physicians and medical educators featuring contemplative practices, personal narratives, and appreciative dialogs about challenging experiences may hold promise in improving participants' well-being while also improving compassionate care, job satisfaction, work engagement, and teamwork. Methods: We collected baseline and 2-month follow-up data during four workshops conducted in 2018 to 2019 at conference centers in the United States and Europe. Primary outcomes were burnout, work-related distress, job satisfaction, work engagement, patient-centered compassionate care, and teamwork. Results: Eighty-five of 120 participants (71%) completed both surveys (mean age was 49.3 and 68.2% female). There were improvements (P < .01) in two of three burnout components (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization), work-related distress, job satisfaction, patient-centered compassionate care, work engagement and meaning, teamwork, well-being, positive emotion, mindfulness, somatic symptoms, and spirituality. Effect sizes (standardized mean difference of change) ranged from 0.25 to 0.61. With Bonferroni adjustments (P < .0031), teamwork, general well-being, and mindfulness became nonsignificant. Discussion: An intensive, multiday, mindfulness-based workshop for physicians had clinically significant positive effects on clinician well-being, quality of interpersonal care and work satisfaction, and meaning and engagement, all important indicators of improved health and sustainability of the health care workforce. Future iterations of the program should increase the focus on teamwork.",

The aim of the current research was to investigate the immediate effects of single sessions of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on state anxiety and state mindfulness and establish whether there is a difference between the outcomes of the two practices. Altruism and boredom were used as covariates to observe whether they have a significant impact on the final results.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDUREUniversity students (N = 80) were randomly allocated to either the MM or LKM condition and were asked to complete the scales before and after they listened to audio guided meditation instructions. Prior to the meditation participants completed state mindfulness and state anxiety scales. Post-meditation participants again filled in state mindfulness and state anxiety scales, and trait scales on altruism and boredom.RESULTSThe results indicated that both types of mindfulness-based practices successfully decreased the initial levels of anxiety and elevated state mindfulness. Non-significant differences between the outcomes of the meditative practices were observed when controlling for altruism and boredom.CONCLUSIONSAlternative practices appeal more to some participants than to others. Clinical implications are discussed with a focus on the beneficial effects of both MM and LKM.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive and behavioral interventions have been shown to be efficacious when used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for psychotic disorders. However, little previous research has investigated potential mediators of change in psychological treatments for psychosis. Acceptance and mindfulness-based therapies do not focus on directly reducing the psychotic symptoms themselves, but instead attempt to alter the patient's relationship to symptoms to decrease their negative impact. The current study examined this issue with data from a previously published randomized trial comparing brief treatment with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) versus treatment as usual for hospitalized patients with psychotic symptoms (Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006a). Results showed that the believability of hallucinations at posttreatment statistically mediated the effect of treatment condition on hallucination-related distress. Hallucination frequency did not mediate outcome. The current study is a first step toward understanding the potential mechanisms of action in psychological treatments for psychosis.",

        "abstract": "Physical activity offers substantial mind-body health benefits and reduced mortality, yet many individuals are chronically underactive. Physical activity interventions may benefit from integrative approaches that join components of mindfulness and neurobiological models of behavior. Mindfulness increases one's awareness of cognitions and physical sensations to potentially facilitate self-regulation, while neurobiological models such as the dual system model of health behavior offer guidance on improving physical activity intervention targets. This 2-phase study includes an initial development process to create brief (similar to 4 min) mindfulness informed guided imagery audio files that target distinct cognitive and affective processes to promote physical activity. In the second phase, participants completed a 2-week pilot intervention study to gather qualitative and quantitative data on intervention feasibility and acceptability. Participants endorsed the mindfulness informed guided imagery as easy to use, enjoyable and helpful. Over a 2-week intervention period participants reported positive shifts in behavior change, physical activity enjoyment, increased mindfulness during physical activity, and increased physical exercise self-efficacy and satisfaction. Interview data revealed that participants increased their frequency of physical activity and tended to experience positive affect during physical activity, engaged in future oriented thinking and were able to view physical activity in a more positive light. Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of an integrative online mindfulness informed guided imagery intervention to promote physical activity enjoyment and engagement. This study extends health behavior change intervention research and provides supporting evidence for a flexible and tailorable online mindfulness-based intervention.",

        "abstract": "There has been an increased interest in the delivery of Mindfulness-Based Programmes (MBPs) in schools yet little is known about how people who deliver MBPs in schools carry out and experience implementation. In this qualitative study, we aimed to examine the experiences of school staff who have a personal mindfulness practice, and who also deliver MBPs to their students. We recruited eight school staff (age range 34-64) who taught students mindfulness, and carried out semi-structured interviews focusing on investigating their positive and negative experiences of delivering mindfulness in schools, how practicing and delivering mindfulness affected their work-life, and their experiences of implementing school-based MBPs. School staff reported that delivering MBPs deepened their own mindfulness practice. The practice enabled them to feel better attuned to others, increased compassion for both themselves and students, helped their emotional regulation, and enhanced resilience to stress. Unexpectedly, half of the participants reported making changes to their work roles and several explicitly linked these changes to the increased self-compassion developed through mindfulness practice. They reported enjoying teaching school students MBPs (and noted that some students embraced mindfulness, and some were reluctant to engage) and sometimes found driving the implementation of MBPs in their school challenging. There appear to be numerous benefits of a personal mindfulness practice for school staff and delivering school-based MBPs can increase feelings of personal accomplishment. Future research is needed into whether MBPs can improve student-teacher relationships, and how some schools have successfully implemented MBPs.",

This study was a psychological intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic to check extent to which brief mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) affect psychological well-being, resilience, and anxiety of HCPs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized trial study conducted from July to August 2020. One hundred and forty-seven COVID-19 frontline HCPs were randomized to a 2-week virtual intervention with a brief MBI or a PMR. Pre- and postintervention assessments were done using the State-Trait Anxiety-20-Item Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, and WHO-5 Well-Being Index.RESULTS: The final sample included 125 HCPs (64 in BMI group and 61 in PMR group) who completed pre- and post-intervention assessment. The results showed a significant improvement in the psychological well-being and reduction of the state anxiety of the two groups, but not in the trait anxiety or resiliency. Improvement was more in the group's brief MBI (81.3%) than in the group's PMR (51.8%) (P = 0.0001), concerning psychological well-being.CONCLUSION: Both the brief MBI and PMR improved the psychological well-being and reduced the anxiety of frontline healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic with a slightly better improvement in the brief MBI.",

        "abstract": "Background: Evidence suggests that psychedelic-assisted therapy carries transdiagnostic efficacy in the treatment of mental health conditions characterized by low mood and the use of avoidance coping strategies. Aims: While preliminary evidence suggests that psychological flexibility and emotion regulation processes play an important role within psychedelic therapy, this prospective study addressed methodological gaps in the literature and examined the ability of ayahuasca to stimulate acute states of cognitive reappraisal and long-term changes in psychological flexibility and mood. The study also explored whether moderating factors predisposed participants to experience therapeutic changes. Methods: Participants (N = 261) were recruited from three Shipibo ayahuasca retreat centers in Central and South America and completed assessments on mood, psychological flexibility, and acute ceremonial factors. Expectancy, demand characteristics, and invalid responding were controlled for with several validity scales. Results/Outcomes: Participants reported significant reductions in negative mood after three months, as well as increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Acute experiences of reappraisal during the ayahuasca ceremony exerted the strongest moderating effects on increases in positive mood and psychological flexibility. Increases in psychological flexibility statistically mediated the effects of acute psychological factors, including reappraisal, on changes in positive mood. Conclusions/Interpretation: These results highlight the role of acute psychological processes, such as reappraisal, and post-acute increases in psychological flexibility as putative mechanisms underlying positive outcomes associated with psychedelics. These results also provide support for the integration of third-wave and mindfulness-based therapy approaches with psychedelic-assisted interventions.",

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program is an effective program for improving well-being. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MBSR programs on the mental well-being of patients with COVID-19.Methods: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted in 2021. We used simple random sampling for recruiting 60 patients with COVID-19 and assigned them to the intervention and control groups. The intervention comprised eight sessions of the MBSR and was performed for the experimental group. The control group received routine post-discharge care. We used a self-report demographic and Ryff's Psychological Well-being Scale to collect data. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics including Covariance, MANCOVA, and effect coefficient were used. The Significance level was considered lower than 0. 05. We used SPSS version 21 for data management.Results: The mean score of mental well-being in the intervention group was 56.76 +/- 6.88 in the pretest stage and 80.76 +/- 7.53 in the post-test stage, and that in the control group was 54.40 +/- 10.31 in the pretest stage and 51.23 +/- 10.08 in the post-test stage.

        "abstract": "We investigated state effects of two forms of meditation on electroencephalography prefrontal alpha-asymmetry, a global indicator of approach versus withdrawal motivation and related affective state. A clinical series of previously depressed individuals were guided to practice either mindfulness breathing meditation (N=8) or a form of meditation directly aimed at cultivating positive affect, loving kindness or metta meditation (N=7). Prefrontal asymmetry was assessed directly before and after the 15-min meditation period. Results showed changes in asymmetry towards stronger relative left prefrontal activation, i.e., stronger approach tendencies, regardless of condition. Further explorations of these findings suggested that responses were moderated by participants' tendencies to engage in ruminative brooding. Individuals high in brooding tended to respond to breathing meditation but not loving kindness meditation, while those low in brooding showed the opposite pattern. Comparisons with an additionally recruited \"rest\" group provided evidence suggesting that changes seen were not simply attributable to habituation. The results indicate that both forms of meditation practice can have beneficial state effects on prefrontal alpha-asymmetry and point towards differential indications for offering them in the treatment of previously depressed patients.",

However, through that adaptation, important contextual factors of traditional contemplative cultures are often dropped or forgotten. This article presents a system of compassion and mindfulness training, Sustainable Compassion Training (SCT), which is designed to help people cultivate increasingly unconditional, inclusive, and sustainable care for self and others. SCT aims to recover important contextual factors of meditation that flexibly meet the diverse needs of modern secular and religious participants. SCT draws on Tibetan Buddhism in dialogue with caregivers, other contemplative traditions and relevant scientific theories to inform meditative transformation for secular contexts. We provide an overview of SCT meditations that includes both contemplative and scientific theories that draw out important features of them. Each meditation includes novel hypotheses that are generated from this dialogical process. We also provide links to audio-guided meditations.",

Those who wished others well (loving-kindness) had lower anxiety, greater happiness, greater empathy, and higher feelings of caring and connectedness than those in a control condition. The Interconnectedness condition resulted only in beneficial effects on social connection. Although social comparison theory suggests that downward social comparison should improve mood, this study found that it had no beneficial effects relative to the control condition and was significantly worse than the loving-kindness condition.

Most mindfulness programs are provided as multi-faceted packages encompassing a set of different mindfulness techniques, each with distinct focus and mechanisms. However, this approach overlooks potential individual differences, which may arise in response to practicing various mindfulness techniques. The present study investigated preferences for four prototypical mindfulness techniques [focused attention (FA), open monitoring (OM), loving-kindness (LK), and body scan (BS)] and identified factors that may contribute to individual differences in these preferences. Participants without prior mindfulness experiences were exposed to each technique through audio-guided instructions and were asked to rank their preferences at the end of all practices. Results indicated that preferences for loving-kindness were predicted by empathy, and that females tended to prefer loving-kindness more than males. Conversely, preferences for open monitoring were predicted by nonreactivity and nonjudgment of present moment experiences. Additionally, higher state mindfulness was detected for individuals' preferred technique relative to other alternatives. These findings suggest that individuals tend to prefer techniques compatible with their personalities, as the predictor variables encompass trait capacities specifically relevant to practicing these techniques. Together, our results suggest the possibility that assessing individual difference and then tailoring MBIs to individual needs could be a useful way to improve intervention effectiveness and subsequent outcomes.",

Methods Study 1 tested this training program in a randomized controlled trial, comparing the effects of loving-kindness practice on employee affect and motivation with an active (mindfulness) and a passive (waitlist) control condition. Analyses focused on both longitudinal effects (increases in affect and motivation over the training period) and state effects (effects of practice on daily affect and motivation). Study 2 conducted a 1-week study to further probe the state effects of loving-kindness and the effectiveness of formal vs. informal practice. Results Results indicated mixed support for longitudinal effects, with individuals in the loving-kindness condition showing increases in work motivation, affective valence, and activation over time but the majority of these increases not being statistically different from trends in the two control conditions. Analysis of state (day-level) effects found consistent support for a beneficial effect of loving-kindness practice on daily affective valence and motivation.

Convergent validity tests showed its relationships with optimism, hope, and altruism but none with forgiveness; discriminant validity tests found positive relationship with psychological entitlement but none with trait anger and greed. Results of the predictive validity test showed that Buddhist generosity mediated the relationship between loving kindness and happiness.

        "abstract": "The development of the compassionate self, associated with practices such as slow and deeper breathing, compassionate voice tones and facial expressions and compassionate focusing, is central to Compassion-Focused Therapy. This study explores the impact of a 2-week compassionate mind training (CMT) program on emotional, self-evaluative and psychopathology measures and on heart rate variability (HRV). Participants (general population and college students) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: CMT (n = 56) and wait-list control (n = 37). Participants in the CMT condition were instructed to practice CMT exercises during 2 weeks. Self-report measures of compassion, positive affect, fears of compassion, self-criticism, shame, depression, anxiety and stress and HRV were collected at pre- and post-interventions in both conditions. Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed significant increases in positive emotions, associated with feeling relaxed and also safe and content, but not activated, and in self-compassion, compassion for others and compassion from others. There were significant reductions in shame, self-criticism, fears of compassion and stress. Only the experimental group reported significant improvement in HRV. Developing awareness of the evolved nature and inherent difficulties of our minds allied with practicing CMT exercises has beneficial effects on participants' psychological and physiological well-being.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Many sport associations have responded to mental health issues in sport through the inclusion of self-management programs, such as mindfulness training, which may improve well-being through increasing one's competence in self-regulating stressors. Yet, the mechanisms accounting such changes lack a theoretical basis, particularly in athletes. Aim: To determine the effect of a mental health intervention comprising a mindfulness program for promoting well-being, reducing stress, and increasing competence in mental health self-management. This is the first study among athletes to test the mechanisms of change in a mindfulness program using Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Methods: A 2 (groups) * 2 (time-point) non-randomized controlled trial was conducted, and between-groups baseline differences were firstly assessed. Two competing regression models assessing singular and serial indirect mediating mechanisms were conducted, in which mindfulness (Model 1) and competence satisfaction (Model 2) were both tested as primary and secondary mediators predicting change scores in stress and well-being. Demographic variables (i.e., gender, age) were controlled for in the analyses. Results: Two hundred and thirty-eight student athletes (mean age = 20.47 years, SD = 3.30, 57.6% = males) participated, with 108 in the intervention group who received an instructional workshop, and a home-directed mindfulness program comprising daily meditation sessions. No baseline differences were found between intervention and control groups. In Model 1, mindfulness was not directly enhanced by the intervention, subsequently resulting in no indirect effects on competence, stress and well-being. In Model 2, the intervention was directly related to positive changes in competence (beta = 0.39, p < 0.05), subsequently resulting in indirect effects on mindfulness awareness (beta = 0.07, p < 0.05), stress (beta = -0.06, p < 0.05), and well-being (beta = 0.05, p < 0.05). In addition, serial indirect effects for the intervention on stress were present through competence and mindfulness awareness in sequence (beta = -0.02, p < 0.05), and; on well-being through competence, mindfulness awareness, and stress in sequence (beta = 0.01, p < 0.05; R 2 = 0.54). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based mental health interventions may be effective at reducing stress and promoting well-being in athletes, with the caveat that attention is given to the inclusion of mental health competence promotion in program design. However, it remains unclear whether increasing mindfulness itself can exert additional salutary effects. Our findings have an important bearing on how mindfulness programs are developed within athlete mental health interventions.",

The current study assessed the role of compassionate love in mediating the relationship between meditation and mental health in later life. METHOD: Using data from a nationwide web -based survey (N = 1,861), we examined the indirect effects of meditation on depressive symptoms and anxiety via compassionate love. RESULTS: Participants who practiced meditation (compared to those who did not) had significantly higher feelings of being loved (b = 0.11, p < 0.05); those who experienced more love had lower depressive symptoms (b = -2.10, p < 0.001) and anxiety (b = -0.99, p < 0.001). Meditation also had significant indirect effects (via compassionate love) on depressive symptoms (b = -0.23, p < 0.05) and anxiety (b = -0.11, p < 0.05).

        "abstract": "Mindfulness -based treatments are efficacious for psychotic disorders (PD). However, which components of mindfulness (i.e., attentive monitoring and nonjudgmental acceptance) are most relevant treatment targets is unclear. Further, there is a dearth of literature examining clinical correlates of mindfulness in people with PD. The present study aimed to examine group differences and clinical correlates of mindfulness in people with PD. We hypothesized that PD would report lower monitoring and acceptance than CN and that mindfulness components would be associated with symptoms including dysfunctional beliefs, alexithymia, neurocognitive ability, positive symptoms, and mood symptoms. Groups included individuals with PD (n = 54) and nonpsychiatric controls (n = 55). Participants completed self -report measures of mindfulness and related constructs and clinical interviews of symptoms. Results of ANOVA models indicated that global mindfulness was lower in PD relative to CN, with greatest differences evident for acceptance in the affective psychosis group. Regression models found that greater monitoring was associated with improved neurocognitive performance, while acceptance was associated with lower defeatist beliefs, alexithymia, and depression/anxiety symptoms.

        "abstract": "While a very few studies have been conducted on classifying loving kindness meditation (LKM) and non-meditation electroencephalography (EEG) data for a single session, there are no such studies conducted for multiple session EEG data. Thus, this study aims at classifying existing raw EEG meditation data on single and multiple sessions to come up with meaningful inferences which will be highly beneficial when developing algorithms that can support meditation practices. In this analysis, data have been collected on Pre-Resting (before-meditation), Post-Resting (after-meditation), LKM-Self and LKM-Others for 32 participants and hence allowing us to conduct six pairwise comparisons for the four mind tasks. Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a feature extraction method widely used in motor imaginary brain computer interface (BCI), but not in meditation EEG data. Therefore, using CSP in extracting features from meditation EEG data and classifying meditation/non-meditation instances, particularly for multiple sessions will create a new path in future meditation EEG research. The classification was done using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) where both meditation techniques (LKM-Self and LKM-Others) were compared with Pre-Resting and Post-Resting instances. The results show that for a single session of 32 participants, around 99.5% accuracy was obtained for classifying meditation/Pre-Resting instances. For the 15 participants when using five sessions of EEG data, around 83.6% accuracy was obtained for classifying meditation/Pre-Resting instances. The results demonstrate the ability to classify meditation/Pre-Resting data. Most importantly, this classification is possible for multiple session data as well. In addition to this, when comparing the classification accuracies of the six mind task pairs; LKM-Self, LKM-Others and Post-Resting produced relatively lower accuracies among them than the accuracies obtained for classifying Pre-Resting with the other three. This indicates that Pre-Resting has some features giving a better classification indicating that it is different from the other three mind tasks.",

Method: In a randomized controlled study (N = 42) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the neurocognitive mechanisms behind mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) combining loving-kindness meditation (LKM) on a group with subclinical depression compared with the relaxation group across emotional face n -back (EFNBACK) tasks and resting state. We also collected behavioral and self-reported data to confirm neurocognitive results. Results: During EFNBACK, the MBCT+LKM group showed greater activation in the left lingual gyrus and right inferior lateral occipital cortex. During rest, the MBCT+LKM group demonstrated increased connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and right inferior lateral occipital cortex, right anterior insula and left precentral gyrus. From amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) data, activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control decreased and activity in brain regions associated with sensorimotor increased. Conclusion: These results suggest that MBCT+LKM alleviate depression for subclinical individuals through improving executive function when they face negative stimuli.",

        "title": "Resilience@Work Mindfulness Program: Results From a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial With First Responders",
        "abstract": "Background: A growing body of research suggests that resilience training can play a pivotal role in creating mentally healthy workplaces, particularly with regard to protecting the long-term well-being of workers. Emerging research describes positive outcomes from various types of resilience training programs (RTPs) among different occupational groups. One specific group of workers that may benefit from this form of proactive resilience training is first responders. Given the nature of their work, first responders are frequently exposed to stressful circumstances and potentially traumatic events, which may impact their overall resilience and well-being over time.Objective: This study aimed to examine whether a mindfulness-based RTP (the Resilience@Work [RAW] Mindfulness Program) delivered via the internet can effectively enhance resilience among a group of high-risk workers. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comprising 24 Primary Fire and Rescue and Hazmat stations within New South Wales. Overall, 12 stations were assigned to the 6-session RAW Mindfulness Program and 12 stations were assigned to the control condition. A total of 143 active full-time firefighters enrolled in the study. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, immediately post training, and at 6-month follow-up. Measurements examined change in both adaptive and bounce-back resilience as well as several secondary outcomes examining resilience resources and acceptance and mindfulness skills.Results: Mixed-model repeated measures analysis found that the overall test of group-by-time interaction was significant (P=.008), with the intervention group increasing in adaptive resilience over time. However, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group in terms of change in bounce-back resilience (P=.09). At 6-month follow-up, the group receiving the RAW intervention had an average increase in their resilience score of 1.3, equating to a moderate-to-large effect size compared with the control group of 0.73 (95% CI 0.38-1.06). Per-protocol analysis found that compared with the control group, the greatest improvements in adaptive resilience were observed among those who completed most of the RAW program, that is, 5 to 6 sessions (P=.002).Conclusions: The results of this RCT suggest that mindfulness-based resilience training delivered in an internet format can create improvements in adaptive resilience and related resources among high-risk workers, such as first responders. Despite a number of limitations, the results of this study suggest that the RAW Mindfulness Program is an effective, scalable, and practical means of delivering online resilience training in high-risk workplace settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a mindfulness-based RTP delivered entirely via the internet has been tested in the workplace.",

        "abstract": "The beneficial effects of mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions have stimulated a rapidly growing body of scientific research into underlying psychological processes. Resulting evidence indicates that engaging with mindfulness meditation is associated with increased performance on a range of cognitive tasks. However, the mechanisms promoting these improvements require further investigation. We studied changes in behavioural performance of 34 participants during a multiple object tracking (MOT) task that taps core cognitive processes, namely sustained selective visual attention and spatial working memory. Concurrently, we recorded the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), an EEG signal elicited by the continuously flickering moving objects, and indicator of attentional engagement. Participants were tested before and after practicing eight weeks of mindful breath awareness meditation or progressive muscle relaxation as active control condition. The meditation group improved their MOT-performance and exhibited a reduction of SSVEP amplitudes, whereas no such changes were observed in the relaxation group. Neither group changed in self-reported positive affect and mindfulness, while a marginal increase in negative affect was observed in the mindfulness group. This novel way of combining MOT and SSVEP provides the important insight that mindful breath awareness meditation may lead to refinements of attention networks, enabling more efficient use of attentional resources.",

Mindfulness meditation has shown early efficacy in improving psychological distress among cancer patients. However, the overall scientific study of app-based mindfulness-based interventions is still in its early stages. The goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a commercially available mindfulness mobile app intervention \"Ten Percent Happier\" among AYA survivors of childhood cancer.METHODS: We conducted a single-arm pilot intervention with 25 AYA survivors of childhood cancer ages 18-29 years.RESULTS: A total of 108 potentially eligible individuals were initially identified for screening. Of the 45 individuals reached (contact rate = 41.67%), 20 declined to participate; 25 were enrolled in the study and completed the baseline survey (enrollment rate = 55.56%). Twenty-one participants completed the study (retention rate = 84%). Changes in several outcomes were promising, with medium to large effect sizes: Mindfulness (d = 0.74), Negative Emotion (d = 0.48), Perceived Stress (d = 0.52), and Mental Health (d = 0.45). Furthermore, results suggested that participants with consistent app usage showed greater improvement in reported outcomes than those who stopped their usage (e.g., Mindfulness: d = 0.74, Perceived Stress: d = 0.83, Mental Health: d = 0.51; Meaning and Purpose: d = 0.84; and Sleep Disturbance: d = 0.81). Qualitative feedback indicated high satisfaction, but participants suggested adding group or individual peer support to improve their experience with the app.CONCLUSIONS: AYA survivors can be difficult to reach, but a mindfulness app was feasible and acceptable to this group. In particular, the robust retention rate and high satisfaction ratings indicate that the meditation mobile app was well received. Preliminary results suggest positive changes in health-related quality of life outcomes, warranting a larger efficacy trial.",

Initial research presents mixed findings in MBI engagement related to participant characteristics, and there is a lack of research examining the influence of context on engagement, despite the critical role context plays in academic engagement. This study examines the contribution of student demographic characteristics and classroom context to MBI engagement. Methods: Survey engagement data were collected at three time points from 106 ninth grade students (M-age = 14.17 years, 60.4% female, 44.2% Black, 24.8% Hispanic/Latino) who participated in the Be CALM program during the 2021-2022 school year. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine trajectory of student engagement and assess student and classroom predictors of engagement. Results: There was no overall change in the trajectory of student engagement, although variability was observed across classes. Identifying as Hispanic/Latino was associated with lower engagement (beta = -.25, p = .008), although this did not appear to be related to program experience. Peer connections predicted engagement at the end of the program (beta = .39, p < .001). Post hoc analyses suggested that student engagement may be related to teacher program delivery quality. Conclusions: Student engagement in MBIs appears related to classroom context more than student characteristics, although further research with larger samples is needed to assess the link between engagement and program outcomes. Findings have implications for designing school-based MBIs and training school staff to deliver them in culturally responsive ways.",

        "abstract": "Background Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in treating major depression. Because mindfulness involves monitoring and accepting current experiences, it may lead people resolve incongruencies between emotional responses that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Mindfulness may thus foster congruence between implicit and explicit emotions. The current randomized controlled trial tested this notion. Methods N = 39 patients with an acute depressive episode were randomly assigned to an 8-week MBI (n = 24) or a psychopharmacological consultation condition (n = 15). Explicit and implicit mood and depressive symptoms were assessed before treatment and at the end of treatment. Results Compared with the control condition, patients receiving MBI demonstrated higher congruence between implicit and explicit negative mood after treatment. There was no such difference in congruence of implicit and explicit positive mood. Additional analyses showed that only within the MBI group, individual differences in explicit mood became less stable. In contrast, individual differences in implicit mood remained stable in both groups. Limitations There was no control group including an active psychological intervention, the sample was small, and emotional congruence was not assessed within persons. Conclusions These findings correspond with the idea that mindfulness reduces incongruencies between implicit and explicit emotional responses. We found preliminary evidence for this effect for negative emotional responses. There was suggestive evidence that congruence arose from the alignment of explicit responses (which became less stable) to implicit responses (which remained stable). Studying the interplay between implicit and explicit processes may shed light on the working mechanisms of clinical-psychological interventions.",

Methods Two hundred and fifteen patients were randomized in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) ( ID: NCT01476371) conducted in 2012 at 16 primary healthcare centres in southern Sweden. The patients were randomized to MGT or treatment as usual (TAU) and completed four psychometric self-rated scales after 8 weeks of treatment. Approximately 12 months after the completion of the 8-week treatment, the same scales were repeated. Ordinal and generalized linear-mixed models, adjusted for cluster effects, were used for the analysis. Results For all four psychometric scales (MADRS-S [Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale-S], HADS-D, HADS-A [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale A and D] and PHQ-9 [Patient Health Questionnaire-9]) the scores at the 1-year follow-up were significantly improved (all P values <0.001) in both groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the MGT and TAU in the psychometric scores at the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT comparing the long-term improvements after MGT with TAU. Although it cannot be excluded that our findings are a result of the natural course of common psychiatric disorders or other factors, they suggest a long-term positive improvement after both MGT and TAU.",

        "title": "How Does MBCT for Depression Work? Studying Cognitive and Affective Mediation Pathways",
        "abstract": "Mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce current symptoms and to prevent recurrence of major depressive disorder. At present, it is not well understood which underlying mechanisms during MBCT are associated with its efficacy. The current study (n = 130) was designed to examine the roles of mindfulness skills, rumination, worry and affect, and the interplay between those factors, in the mechanisms of change in MBCT for residual depressive symptoms. An exploratory but systematic approach was chosen using Sobel-Goodman mediation analyses to identify mediators on the pathway from MBCT to reduction in depressive symptoms. We replicated earlier findings that therapeutic effects of MBCT are mediated by changes in mindfulness skills and worry. Second, results showed that changes in momentary positive and negative affect significantly mediated the efficacy of MBCT, and also mediated the effect of worry on depressive symptoms. Third, within the group of patients with a prior history of <= 2 episodes of MDD, predominantly changes in cognitive and to a lesser extent affective processes mediated the effect of MBCT. However, within the group of patients with a prior history of >= 3 episodes of MDD, only changes in affect were significant mediators for the effect of MBCT.Trail Registration: Nederlands Trial Register NTR1084",

        "abstract": "Studies examining the health of public housing residents are limited. In response, community-based participatory research principles were used to develop an intervention aimed at improving health outcomes related to multifactorial risk behaviors among Latino families living in a low-income neighborhood. A two-part needs assessment was completed to guide the intervention: interviews with parents (n = 10) and a group model building (GMB) workshop with youth and parents (n = 40) to explore the parent-youth dynamic. Interviews indicated that poverty, youth disobedience, and inadequate communication between parents and youth led to parental stress. During the workshop, balancing and reinforcing feedback loops involving Communication, Trust, and Respect between youth and parents were identified. Based on these findings and collaboration with a community advisory board, a bilingual, mindfulness-based meditation intervention was designed to address community needs: positive parent-child interaction emphasizing trust and communication, stress reduction, and family well-being.",

        "abstract": "Objective Mindfulness has been defined as being intentionally aware of internal and external experiences that occur at the present moment, without judgment. Techniques that develop mindfulness, such as meditation, have positive effects on reducing insomnia, a sleep disorder that is common both during and after menopause. Our aim was to establish whether postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than postmenopausal women without sleep disorders.Methods Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years who did not use hormone therapy were recruited for the study. The sample included 14 women with insomnia and 12 women without insomnia or any other sleep disorder. The groups were comparable in age, schooling, and anxiety level. To assess mindfulness, we used the validated Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the attentiveness domain of the Positive and Negative Affect ScheduleExpanded Form.Results Participants with insomnia were less mindful than healthy women. The level of mindfulness was able to discriminate the group with insomnia from the healthy group, with 71.4% accuracy.Conclusions Postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than women without insomnia. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as meditation, may be beneficial for postmenopausal insomnia.",

They have been shown to be useful in reducing stress and enhancing well-being in different contexts. In this research, the effectiveness of an MBI was evaluated on variables that can promote successful job performance such as mindfulness trait, positive and negative affect, forgiveness, personality strengths and satisfaction with life. The intervention was carried out through a smartphone application called \"Aire Fresco\" (Fresh Air) during 14 days in the middle of the quarantine produced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study sample was composed of 164 Spanish people who were distributed in two groups: control group and experimental group, which were evaluated before and after the intervention. The MANCOVA performed showed an overall positive effect of the intervention on the variables evaluated. The different ANCOVAs carried out showed that the intervention was beneficial in increasing mindfulness trait, reducing negative affect or increasing life satisfaction, among others. Our study is, as far as we know, the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of a brief intervention in mindfulness conducted using a smartphone application in Spanish.",

Aims This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention on reducing prenatal stress compared to participation in health education groups. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a prenatal clinic of comprehensive tertiary care from April to October 2017. A total of 108 pregnant women were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Participants completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, fatigue, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness before, immediately after, and 15 weeks after the 4-week intervention period. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the intervention outcomes. Results The results supported greater improvement in terms of perceived stress (Wald chi(2)=26.94, p<0.001), fatigue (Wald chi(2)=17.61, p<0.001), positive affect (Wald chi(2)=9.03, p = 0.011), negative affect (Wald chi(2)=11.37, p = 0.003), and mindfulness (Wald chi(2)=24.97, p<0.001) in the intervention group than in the control group.

        "abstract": "Technology is increasingly being integrated into the provision of therapy and mental health interventions. While the evidence base for technology-led delivery of mindfulness-based interventions is growing, one approach to understand the effects of technology-delivered elements includes programs that retain some aspects of traditional face-to-face interaction. This arrangement offers unique practical advantages, and also enables researchers to isolate variables that may be underlying the effects of technology-delivered interventions. The present study reports on a pilot videoconference-delivered mindfulness-based group intervention offered to university students and staff members with wait-list controls. Apart from the first session of the 6-week course, the main facilitator guided evening classes remotely via online videoconferencing, with follow-up exercises via email. Participants were taught a variety of mindfulness-based exercises such as meditation, breathing exercises, and mindful tasting, as well as the concepts underpinning such practice. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires on depression, anxiety, repetitive negative thinking, dysfunctional attitudes, positive and negative affect, self-compassion, compassion for others, and mindfulness. For participants who attended at least five of the six sessions, scores on all outcome measures improved significantly post-intervention and remained stable at 3-week follow-up. The videoconference-delivered mindfulness-based group intervention appears to provide a viable alternative format to standard mindfulness programs where the facilitator and participants need to live in close physical proximity with each other.",

        "title": "Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression",
        "abstract": "Mindfulness has received considerable attention as a correlate of psychological well-being and potential mechanism for the success of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Despite a common emphasis of mindfulness, at least in name, among MBIs, mindfulness proves difficult to assess, warranting consideration of other common components. Self-compassion, an important construct that relates to many of the theoretical and practical components of MBIs, may be an important predictor of psychological health. The present study compared ability of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) to predict anxiety, depression, worry, and quality of life in a large community sample seeking self-help for anxious distress (N = 504). Multivariate and univariate analyses showed that self-compassion is a robust predictor of symptom severity and quality of life, accounting for as much as ten times more unique variance in the dependent variables than mindfulness. Of particular predictive utility are the self-judgment and isolation subscales of the SCS. These findings suggest that self-compassion is a robust and important predictor of psychological health that may be an important component of MBIs for anxiety and depression. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, heart rate variability (HRV) has been monitored in different forms of Shamatha quiescence meditation: three breath meditations, Settling the Mind in its natural state, Awareness of Awareness, Loving-kindness and Tonglen. Establish and test a practical means of monitoring neurobiological effects of meditation. Over 6 weeks, two experimental groups practiced Shamatha meditation on a daily basis (n = 20). HRV patterns and cortisol tests were monitored at three measuring points during these weeks, and an attention focus test was performed at the start and after 6 weeks. Six weeks of regular practice in Shamatha meditation were associated with HRV indices suggesting improvements in the homeostatic regulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in 85% of the HRV recordings (tachogram and frequency specter) of all 20 subjects. Further, a substantial decrease in cortisol levels was also noted. The attention focus test showed a significant increase of 18.7% in sustained attention, moving from medium to high attention focus, with a significant result of t(20) = - 8.764 and p < 0.001. Participants reported positive subjective changes in attention focus, sense of happiness and calmness and increased abilities in emotional regulation and attunement. Six weeks of regular practice in Shamatha meditation contributes to a substantial increase of attention focus and a decrease in stress levels evidenced in changes in diurnal cortisol measures. HRV biofeedback shows that the sympathetic nervous system is counterbalanced by increased vagal tone, and autonomic balance is enhanced by all Shamatha meditations, not only breath meditations, but also mind meditations: Settling the Mind in its natural state, Awareness of Awareness, Loving-kindness and Tonglen. Although these results are promising, further research is recommended with HRV biofeedback instruments to report statistical analysis and to understand unique HRV patterns in Shamatha mind meditation.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness-based strategies show promise for targeting the construct of impulsivity and associated variables among problematic alcohol users. This study examined the moderating role of intervention (mindfulness vs relaxation vs control) on trait impulsivity and three outcomes examined post-intervention (negative affect, positive affect, and urge to drink) among 207 college students with levels of at risk drinking. Moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between baseline impulsivity and the primary outcomes significantly differed for participants who underwent the mindfulness versus relaxation interventions. Notably, simple slope analyses revealed that negative urgency was positively associated with urge to drink following the mindfulness intervention. Among participants who underwent the relaxation intervention, analysis of simple slopes revealed that negative urgency was negatively associated with urge to drink, while positive urgency was positively associated with positive affect following the relaxation intervention. Findings suggest that level (low vs high) and subscale of impulsivity matter with regard to how a participant will respond to a mindfulness versus relaxation intervention.

In this paper, we report the results of an online experiment (n = 1000) comparing the impact of three different short-term mindfulness interventions on various (self-reported and incentivized) measures of mindfulness state and sustainable behavior. While only one of our interventions is found to impact environmental attitude and climate policy support directly, we show that the three meditation practices indirectly foster sustainable behavior through preidentified mediators.

        "abstract": "Female smokers often have higher levels of eating disorder symptoms than non-smokers, and concerns about eating and weight might interfere with smoking cessation. Thus, it is critical to identify factors to promote healthier eating and body image in this population. Initial research suggests that specific aspects of trait mindfulness predict lower body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms among non-smokers. However, these relationships are unknown among smokers. The current study examined associations between facets of trait mindfulness and eating disorder symptoms in 112 college female smokers (83% Caucasian: mean age 20 years, SD = 1.69). After controlling for relevant sociodemographic variables, Describing and Nonjudging facets of mindfulness predicted lower bulimic symptoms and body dissatisfaction (ps < .05), while Acting with Awareness predicted lower bulimic and anorexic symptoms, ps < .05. Observing predicted higher anorexic symptoms, ps < .05. These results suggest that specific mindfulness facets are related to lower eating disorder symptoms among smokers, whereas other facets are not associated or have a positive relationship with these symptoms. Mindfulness-based interventions focusing on Describing, Nonjudging, and Acting with Awareness may help to reduce eating pathology among female smokers, which could potentially improve smoking cessation rates in this population.

Theoretically, characteristics of mindfulness should be incompatible with distorted patterns of criminal thinking, but is this in fact the case? Among both 259 male jail inmates and 516 undergraduates, mindfulness was inversely related to the Criminogenic Cognitions Scale (CCS) through a latent variable of emotion regulation. However, in the jail sample, this mediational model also showed a direct, positive path from mindfulness to CCS, with an analogous, but nonsignificant trend in the college sample. Post hoc analyses indicate that the Nonjudgment of Self scale derived from the Mindfulness Inventory: Nine Dimensions (MI:ND) largely accounts for this apparently iatrogenic effect in both samples. Some degree of self-judgment is perhaps necessary and useful, especially among individuals involved in the criminal justice system.",

In this study, we use lovingkindness meditation to enhance positive attitudes toward the self and others. Meditation-based programs often include several components for which specific effects and dynamics are largely unknown, precluding conclusive support for their effectiveness. The present study tested actions underlying two main components of lovingkindness meditation programs: discussion and meditation. Discussion focuses on a conceptual understanding of lovingkindness, whereas meditation focuses on direct experiences and cultivation of lovingkindness. Participants (n = 54) were randomly assigned either to attend a 6-week lovingkindness discussion course or to be waitlisted for 6 weeks, both followed by attending a 6-week lovingkindness meditation course. Attending the lovingkindness discussion course alone had beneficial effects on attitudes toward the self, but not others. Attending the lovingkindness meditation course had additional positive impacts on attitudes toward the self and others. These findings suggest that understanding ideas of lovingkindness through knowledge-based discussion without meditation may be sufficient to create positive changes in the view of self. However, for more comprehensive changes in attitude toward others, direct experiences of lovingkindness through meditation may be necessary.",

Moreover, longitudinal data must be examined using appropriate study designs. We recruited 60 schizophrenia patients and randomly assigned them to an MBI or to a treatment-as-usual group. Negative symptoms, positive symptoms, mindfulness, and depression were assessed at baseline, post-course, and at a 3-month follow-up. Descriptive analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEES) were used to examine the effects of MBI. We found that MBI mitigated the severity of negative symptoms and of general schizophrenic psychopathology except for the positive symptoms and for those of depression. Unexpectedly, we did not find long-term effect of mindfulness on negative symptoms. Larger sample sizes, long-term practical course, more rigorous study procedures, and a double-blind design should be considered in future studies.",

In the experimental group (n = 42), a mindfulness session was performed that included different guided meditation exercises. In the control group (n = 26), an emotion recognition exercise was carried out, along with a series of creative activities. Results showed that the mindfulness session was effective, because there was a significant reduction in negative affect (d = -.56, p < .001) and state anxiety (d = -.54, p = .007) in the experimental group. Likewise, there was an increase in sOXT (d = .99, p < .001) in this group, compared with the control group.

This study focused on the long-term effects of this RCT during the nine-month follow-up period, and on possible predictors, moderators and working mechanisms.Methods: Distressed cancer patients (n=245) were randomized to MBCT or eMBCT. Data were collected at baseline, post-treatment, three- and nine-month follow-up. Data were analyzed with linear mixed effect models and (hierarchical) linear regressions.Results: Analyses revealed long-term reductions in psychological distress and rumination, and long-term increases in positive mental health and mental health-related quality of life (QoL) in both interventions over the course of the nine-month follow-up. Interestingly, patients reported less psychological distress in the follow-up period after eMBCT in comparison to MBCT. Less psychological distress, rumination and neuroticism, and more extraversion and agreeableness at baseline predicted less psychological distress at the nine-month follow-up after both interventions. Less mindful and conscientious patients at baseline benefited more from eMBCT than from MBCT. Regarding working mechanisms, changes in mindfulness skills, fear of cancer recurrence and rumination during both interventions predicted less psychological distress at follow-up.Conclusions: Our findings suggest most improvements in cancer patients' increase over time after both interventions. Furthermore, patients seemed to benefit more from eMBCT than MBCT based on psychological distress levels, especially those patients with low levels of mindfulness skills and conscientiousness.",

However, the applications and psychological outcomes of augmented reality (AR) technologies still remain to be widely explored and evaluated. This is particularly true for the use of AR for the self-management of stress, anxiety, and mood. In the current study, we examined the impact of a brief open heart meditation AR experience on participants with moderate levels of anxiety and/or depression. Using a randomized between-group design subjects participated in the AR experience or the AR experience plus frontal gamma asymmetry neurofeedback integrated into the experience. Self-reported mood state and resting-state EEG were recorded before and after the AR intervention for both groups. Participants also reported on engagement and perceived use of the experience as a stress and coping tool. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of the frontal, midline, and parietal scalp regions, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of anterior cingulate and insular cortical regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both versions of the AR meditation significantly reduced negative mood and increased positive mood. The changes in resting state EEG were also comparable between groups, with some trending differences observed, in line with existing research on open heart and other loving-kindness and compassion-based meditations. Engagement was favorable for both versions of the AR experience, with higher levels of engagement reported with the addition of neurofeedback. These results provide early support for the therapeutic potential of AR-integrated meditations as a tool for the self-regulation of mood and emotion, and sets the stage for more research and development into health and wellness-promoting AR applications.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety and depression co-occur in 50-70% of adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but treatment methods for these comorbid problems have not been systematically studied. Recently, two ASD-tailored protocols were published: mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We wanted to investigate if both methods are equally effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms among adults with ASD. 59 adults with ASD and anxiety or depression scores above 7 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, gave informed consent to participate; 27 followed the CBT protocol, and 32 the MBSR treatment protocol. Anxiety and depression scores, autism symptoms, rumination, and global mood were registered at the start, at the end of the 13-week treatment period, and at 3-months follow-up. Irrational beliefs and mindful attention awareness were used as process measures during treatment and at follow-up. Results indicate that both MBSR and CBT are associated with a reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults with ASD, with a sustained effect at follow-up, but without a main effect for treatment group. A similar pattern was seen for the reduction of autistic symptoms, rumination and the improvement in global mood. There are some indications that MBSR may be preferred over CBT with respect to the treatment effect on anxiety when the scores on measures of irrational beliefs or positive global mood at baseline are high. Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapies are both promising treatment methods for reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in adults with ASD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Previous research has shown the positive effects of meditation on physical and mental health, but little is known about what psychological processes occur during meditation. The current study investigated experience of affective states in Zen meditation during a 3-day meditation retreat using a single-case design. We used a novel push-button method to measure affective states and multilevel models to analyze the 6 single-case studies. As expected, we found that participants were more likely to have a no-self/spiritual or joy/elation experience toward the end of a meditation session than toward the beginning. Contrary to what we expected, there was no relationship between the meditation session variables and having an anguish/suffering experience. Individual differences had a non-negligible influence on the relationships for all 3 affective states, meaning that meditation did not produce the same results in the participants. We conclude by discussing how our method can be incorporated into future studies of meditation, or other religious variables.",

Its effectiveness on improving wellbeing in people with epilepsy (PWE) has been shown in a few studies. This study aimed to explore factors related to participants willingness to engage in psychological interventions from the perspective of patients with epilepsy.Methods: Participants answered a needs assessment questionnaire eliciting information about their illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ)), emotions (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), willingness to participate in psychological interventions, preferences in types of PPI and intervention designs, as well as banners in seeking mental health services.Results: A total of 154 patients with epilepsy participated, with a mean age of 37.3 years (range 16-86 years). Most patients had focal epilepsy (68.2%), and drug-resistant (59.1%). Majority (71.4%) of them indicated a strong willingness to participate in PPI. Out of nine types of PPI, character strengths, mindfulness-based and expressive based interventions were highly preferred. Those with negative illness perception (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.004), and being unemployed (p = 0.048) were more willing to participate in PPE Most participants preferred group rather than individual session, and a shorter duration (30 min) was favored by most.Conclusion: This study captured the self-report willingness to participate in psychological interventions. Findings suggested that psychological interventions delivered in short-group session were highly preferred. Future study is required to determine the feasibility of such design for patients with epilepsy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In recent three decades, studies have shown that MBSR has a positive effect on physical and psychological dimensions of chronic illnesses. Chemically pulmonary injured veterans have chronic pulmonary and psychological problems due to mustard gas exposure and complications of Iran-Iraq war. These stresses have negative effects on their general health and immune system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted on psychoneuroimmunology and MBSR in these patients.Forty male pulmonary injured veterans were randomly divided in two groups with 20 participants (MBSR and wait-list control). Then MBSR group received 8 weekly sessions of intervention. We tested mental health based on general health questionnaire (GHQ)-28 questionnaire, health-related quality of life (based on St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ)) and immunity in MBSR groups; before and after intervention \"mixed factorial analyses of variance\" test was used for analyzing data fpr each dependent variable and appropriate t-tests were done in The necessary condition.Results showed that mental health and health-related quality of life, in MBSR group compared to wait-list control improved [F (1,38)= 26.46, p< 0.001; F (1,38)= 49.52, p< 0.001 respectively] significantly.

        "abstract": "Meditation practice is believed to foster states of mindful awareness and mental quiescence in everyday life. If so, then the cultivation of these qualities with training ought to leave its imprint on the activity of intrinsic functional brain networks. In an intensive longitudinal study, we investigated associations between meditation practitioners' experiences of felt mindful awareness and changes in the spontaneous electrophysiological dynamics of functional brain networks. Experienced meditators were randomly assigned to complete 3 months of full-time training in focused-attention meditation (during an initial intervention) or to serve as waiting-list controls and receive training second (during a later intervention). We collected broadband electroencephalogram (EEG) during rest at the beginning, middle, and end of the two training periods. Using a data-driven approach, we segmented the EEG into a time series of transient microstate intervals based on clustering of topographic voltage patterns. Participants also provided daily reports of felt mindful awareness and mental quiescence, and reported daily on four experiential qualities of their meditation practice during training. We found that meditation training led to increases in mindful qualities of awareness, which corroborate contemplative accounts of deepening mental calm and attentional focus. We also observed reductions in the strength and duration of EEG microstates across both interventions. Importantly, changes in the dynamic sequencing of microstates were associated with daily increases in felt attentiveness and serenity during training. Our results connect shifts in subjective qualities of meditative experience with the large-scale dynamics of whole brain functional EEG networks at rest.",

Methods The 241 participants (18-81 years, M = 40.3, SD = 14.8; 64% female) completed an online questionnaire consisting of scales measuring mindfulness components (mindful attention, acceptance, non-judging), and mindfulness related qualities, including loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and empathy. The participants who reported being meditators (N = 122; 50.4%) were also asked questions about their meditation practice. Results Meditators differed significantly from non-meditators in relation to their levels of mindful attention (t((239)) = 4.80, p < .001, d = .63) and empathy (t(()(239)) = 2.80, p < .01, d = .37) but not for the other mindfulness components or related qualities. Multiple regression analyses indicated that practice variables (years of practice, frequency of practice, and length of session) explained a significant proportion of variance in mindful attention (R-2 = .27, p < .001) and empathy (R-2 = .15, p < .05). Conclusions The present findings are consistent with conceptualizations of mindfulness that focus on the centrality of mindful attention over acceptance and non-judging components, which is consistent with several Buddhist mindfulness traditions. Present findings also demonstrate the importance of practice for the cultivation of mindful attention. Future studies are required to increase our understanding of effects relating to the type of mindfulness undertaken and the influence of practice factors.",

Additionally, the study aimed to assess the internal consistency of the CAMM with this sample and to determine its convergent validity. All analyses were conducted for the entire sample as well as for males and females separately. Results confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAMM and the internal consistency of the ten CAMM items, and there were no significant gender group differences. The convergent validity was also supported, with significant correlations between CAMM scores and measures of psychological functioning/distress in the expected directions. When considering correlations separately by gender, mindfulness was weakly but significantly correlated with positive affect in females but not in males. All other correlations were comparable across gender. Overall, the CAMM appears to be a reliable and valid mindfulness measure for both boys and girls.",

However, most MBIs omit a central Buddhist idea that mindfulness promotes three crucial insights (the inevitability of suffering, impermanence, and interconnection) that are alleged to enhance human functioning.

Analyses with samples 2 and 3 replicated this model in both Thai and UK participants. In testing convergent and divergent validity with samples 2 and 3, the MIS had most of the expected associations with conceptually related constructs. To test discriminant validity, the insights of samples 1 and 2 (Thai residents, who have much exposure to Buddhist teaching) were compared with sample 3 UK residents (who do not).

Two hundred and seventy-eight undergraduate college student participants completed a series of questionnaires examining dispositional mindfulness, difficulties with emotion regulation, and delay of gratification skills. Linear regressions investigated the associations between five facets of mindfulness and each of the two components of self-regulation. Findings revealed that describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreacting mindfulness facets were negatively associated with difficulties with emotion regulation, and that observing, acting with awareness, and nonjudging mindfulness facets were positively associated with delay of gratification skills, after accounting for the effects of the other mindfulness subscales. These preliminary findings may have important clinical relevance, as greater self-regulation has critical implications for social, emotional, and academic functioning.",

The present study addressed the issue of stress management techniques for early career teachers (n = 24) and aimed to contribute to the research surrounding complementary interventions (CIs) for educators. The intervention was designed to include strategies that operated through cognitive and physiological mechanisms that regulated the stress response and increased awareness of behaviours, emotions, and reactivity. The self-report measures included perceived stress, attention awareness, subjective wellbeing, burnout, and job-related affective wellbeing. The results indicated a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress and increases in attention awareness and subjective wellbeing.

Behavioral activation and mindfulness significantly improved depressive symptoms and reward sensitivity. However, the effects of behavioral activation were not superior. The combination treatment versus the waiting group was insignificant regarding reward insensitivity. Explorative analyses revealed that all intervention groups reduced anhedonia substantially. Our findings imply that brief online interventions with behavioral activation and mindfulness-based approaches can impact reward insensitivity, while effects for a combination were less clear.

In cancer patients, it can negatively affect prognosis and posttreatment recovery processes. Since face-to-face psychological interventions are often inaccessible to cancer patients, researchers have recently been focusing on the effectiveness of eHealth adaptations of well-established approaches. In this context, there has been a call for high-quality randomised controlled trials that would allow for a direct comparison of different approaches, potentially addressing different needs and preferences of patients, and also for more systematic research focusing on how psychological interventions affect not only psychological but also biological markers of stress. Both of these questions are addressed in the present study.Methods: A randomised controlled trial will be carried out to test and compare the effectiveness of three eight-week eHealth programmes for the mental health support of cancer patients.

N = 440 of breast cancer survivors will be recruited at the end of their adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both) and randomly assigned to one of the three interventions - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Cancer (MBCT-Ca), Positive Psy-chology (PP), or Autogenic Training (AT) - or the treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. Psychological and biological markers of stress and adaptive functioning will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), three-month follow-up (T2), and nine-month follow-up (T3). Primary outcomes will include heart-rate variability and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, general quality of life, and positive mental health. Secondary outcomes will include the levels of serum cortisol and immunomarkers, sleep quality, fatigue, com-mon health symptoms, and several transdiagnostic psychological variables that are expected to be specifically affected by the MBCT-Ca and PP interventions, including dispositional mindfulness, emotion regulation, self-compassion, perceived hope, and gratitude. The data will be analysed using the mixed model repeated mea-sures (MMRM) approach.Discussion: This trial is unique in comparing three different eHealth interventions for cancer patients based on three well-established approaches to mental health support delivered on the same platform. The study will allow us to examine whether different types of interventions affect different indicators of mental health. In addition, it will provide valuable data regarding the effects of stress-reducing psychological interventions on the biomarkers of stress playing an essential role in cancer recovery processes and general health.",

        "abstract": "With rising average life expectancies and continuing early retirement, China has more retirees than ever before. This study builds from previous research to understand how mental and financial resources affect life satisfaction amongst 1,018 Chengdu, China retirees. Specifically, our research examined how the extents of mindfulness and pension influence life satisfaction and whether the relations are mediated by positive and negative affect (PANA). The SEM results indicate mindfulness has a significant direct (& beta; = 0.26) and an indirect (& beta; = 0.18) effect on life satisfaction via PANA, while the amount of pension has small effect on life satisfaction (& beta; = 0.04) and only via negative affect. The estimates, however, varied by gender and age. Mindfulness had a strong influence on reducing NA for female older adults while substantially increasing PA for male older adults. Additionally, the amount of pension significantly reduced NA for older retirees aged 65 and above. These findings call for increased mindfulness interventions and robust pension policies to better support retired older adults in China.",

        "abstract": "Dissociation is an involuntary defensive mechanism to protect oneself by avoiding unbearable internal conflicts or overwhelming emotions. Cultivating mindful awareness could allow the development of voluntary processes that can offer part of the self-protective function of dissociation while favoring internal integration processes. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of a 7-week Mindfulness Oriented Meditation (MOM) training on healthy individuals' self-reported dissociative experience, mindfulness skills and interoceptive awareness. After the training, in comparison to a waiting-list control group (N = 102), the MOM group (N = 110) showed reduced dissociative tendencies (p < .05), increased dispositional mindfulness (p < .001) and increased interoceptive awareness (in the aspects of not-worrying, self-regulation and body listening; p < .001). Moreover, correlational evidence showed that the more MOM participants increased in mindfulness skills after the training the more they reported increased interoceptive awareness and decreased dissociative functioning (p < .05). Mindfulness skills also improved with more home meditation practice executed by MOM participants (p < .05). These findings were attributed to a possible role of mindfulness meditation in enabling the development of volitional processes that afford psychological safety and integration, in contrast with the involuntary nature of dissociation.",

We predict that meditation may even more significantly alter \"ideal affect\" (how people ideally want to feel). As predicted, meditators ideally wanted to feel calm more and excited less than nonmeditators, but the groups did not differ in their actual experience of calm or excited states (Study 1). We ruled out self-selection and nonspecific effects by randomly assigning participants to meditation classes, an improvisational theater class, or a no class control (Study 2). After eight weeks, meditators valued calm more but did not differ in their actual experience of calm compared with the other groups. There were no differences in ideal or actual excitement, suggesting that meditation selectively increases the value placed on calm. These findings were not due to expectancy effects (Study 3). We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how meditation alters affective life.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesRecent meta-analyses suggest that mindfulness meditation may enhance prosocial behavior, while evidence regarding moral behavior is still scarce. We combined a randomized controlled mindfulness training design with an ecologically valid moral decision-making task (Temptation to Lie Card Game; TLCG), in which participants were tempted to deceive an opponent to increase their monetary payoff.MethodTLCG and self-report measures (in the domains of attention regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation, and change in the perspective of the self) were administered to participants who underwent the mindfulness meditation training (experimental group, n = 44) or were waitlisted (control group, n = 25) twice: before and after the 8-week training.ResultsConcerning moral decision-making, we observed a significant effect involving condition, time, and group. Trained participants deceived significantly less in the post-training as compared with the pre-training phase (p = 0.03), while untrained ones showed no significant change (p = 0.58). In the self-reports, significant effects involving time and group were found for the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) in Self-Regulation, Attention Regulation, Body Listening, and for the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) in Non-Reactivity to inner experience. Trained participants showed a time-related increase in all subscales scores, while untrained ones did not. Finally, a moderation analysis revealed a significant interaction between weekly mindfulness meditation training minutes and MAIA-2 Attention Regulation (post-training) on moral behavior change.ConclusionsOur preliminary results suggest that mindfulness meditation practice decreases self-serving dishonest behavior and increases awareness of one's bodily and emotional state. In particular, the amount of mindfulness meditation practice predicted moral behavior change in practitioners who reported the highest regulation of attention towards internal bodily signals.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.",

We examined whether brief meditation training affects cognition and mood when compared to an active control group. After four sessions of either meditation training or listening to a recorded book, participants with no prior meditation experience were assessed with measures of mood, verbal fluency, visual coding, and working memory. Both interventions were effective at improving mood but only brief meditation training reduced fatigue, anxiety, and increased mindfulness. Moreover, brief mindfulness training significantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning. Our findings suggest that 4 days of meditation training can enhance the ability to sustain attention; benefits that have previously been reported with long-term meditators. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Meditation is gaining popularity as an effective means of managing and attenuating pain and has been particularly effective for migraines. Meditation additionally addresses the negative emotional states known to exist with migraines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of meditation as an immediate intervention for reducing migraine pain as well as alleviating emotional tension, examined herein as a negative affect hypothesized to be correlated with pain. Twenty-seven migraineurs, with two to ten migraines per month, reported migraine-related pain and emotional tension ratings on a Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 10) before and after exposure to a brief meditation-based treatment. All participants were meditation-naive, and attended one 20-minute guided meditation session based on the Buddhist \"loving kindness\" approach. After the session, participants reported a 33% decrease in pain and a 43% decrease in emotional tension. The data suggest that a single exposure to a brief meditative technique can significantly reduce pain and tension, as well as offer several clinical implications. It can be concluded that single exposure to a meditative technique can significantly reduce pain and tension. The effectiveness and immediacy of this intervention offers several implications for nurses. (C) 2014 by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing",

Empirical studies on the relationship between attention and awareness have shown that attention does influence perceptual experience or appearance in addition to better performance in perceptual tasks. The practice of meditation also changes perceptual experience in addition to better perceptual performance. For example, a study with Sahaj Samadhi meditators utilizing negative color afterimages had shown that concentrative meditation influences visual experience. However the brain regions that are modified by meditation practice leading to such changes in visual experience or awareness are still not known. Here using negative color afterimages in a functional MRI study, we investigated the brain mechanisms underlying the changes in visual awareness as a function of attentional enhancement achieved through long-term concentrative meditation practice. We found increased activity in right lateralized inferior occipital and inferior frontal cortex, which suggests the importance of attentional control in modulating visual awareness. The results of this study indicate that the link between attention and conscious experience is possibly changed by meditation practices.",

Yet it is not clear why such a relation exists. This study examined the genetic and environmental contributions of present-moment attention to subjective wellbeing. Consistent with the \"generalist genes hypothesis\" and prior evidence, we hypothesized that presence and subjective wellbeing would show a substantial genetic correlation and smaller environmental correlation. Using a large epidemiological sample of healthy 16-year-old twins in the United Kingdom (N = 1136 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs), genetic overlap was found between presence and the cognitive component of subjective wellbeing (life satisfaction), and to a lesser extent, the affective component of subjective wellbeing (operationalized as happiness). The non-shared environmental overlap between these constructs was substantial. This study provides the first evidence known to us showing that present-centered attention, a primary component of mindfulness, has both genetic and environmental overlap with subjective wellbeing. The findings have implications for understanding mechanisms by which presence is associated with positive emotions and life satisfaction, and suggest, pending additional research, that mindfulness-based interventions to enhance wellbeing may be best suited to those with a genetic propensity toward mindful presence.",

In this context, contemplative practices such as mindfulness have been proposed as a strategy to help students on stress management.Methods: Forty university students (20 female), aged between 18 to 30 years (mean = 24.15; SD = 3.56), with no previous experience with meditation or yoga were recruited at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte and randomized to a mindfulness training (MT) or active control (AC) groups. We analyzed measures of anxiety, affect, stress, as well as state and trait mindfulness in order to evaluate the effects of trait mindfulness and a brief mindfulness intervention in forty healthy young students. Participants were classified as Low (n = 27, females = 13) or High (n = 13, females = 7) Trait Mindfulness by k-means clustering and compared between them using Wilcoxon sum rank test. Furthermore, the sample was randomly allocated to an AC (n = 20, females = 10) or a MT (n = 20, females = 10) group, and mixed analysis of variance was performed to analyze the effect of interventions. The mechanisms and role of trait mindfulness in the intervention was assessed by a moderated mediation analysis.Results: We found that High Trait individuals have lower anxiety trait, anxiety state and perceived stress levels. Only the MT group reduced their anxiety state and perceived stress after the intervention and increased their state mindfulness. Both groups reduced negative affect and cortisol, and no change was found in positive affect. Moderated mediation analysis showed that the training-induced change in state mindfulness mediated the increase in positive affect and the decrease in perceived stress and cortisol, regardless of trait mindfulness. For anxiety state the decrease only occurred in individuals with High Trait Mindfulness.Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that higher trait mindfulness is associated with low levels of psychological distress and that a brief mindfulness-based intervention seems to be useful to reduce distress measures in university students.",

The present study aimed to investigate the link between mindful attention awareness, perceived stress and subjective wellbeing without the presence of a complementary intervention to promote mindfulness-based strategies. Methods: The online survey participants (N = 257) were university students enrolled in initial teacher training. Self-report measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI). Results: PWI was negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.550, p = .001), MAAS was negatively correlated with PSS (r = -0.567, p = .001) and positively correlated with PWI (r = 0.336, p = .001). The mean score for PSS (M = 20.61, SD = 6.62) was above the reported norm (14.2). Conclusions: The findings suggest that higher levels of mindful attention awareness may be associated with lower levels of perceived stress and higher subjective wellbeing levels and lower levels of perceived stress may be associated with higher subjective wellbeing. The findings confirm that pre-service teachers are a demographic that experiences elevated levels of perceived stress regardless of the stage in initial teacher training programs.",

These included psychoeducation, mindfulness-based meditation and rituals to mark the deaths of colleagues. Staff SPACE (Stopping to Process and Consider Events) sessions were used to support staff in managing the many emotions they were experiencing. Positive psychology-based interventions were used to keep morale up and help people to stay motivated. The process of seeking feedback and making changes was introduced to support staff in feeling heard and having a voice. The maternal or master intervention within each of the above was the relational component.Practical implicationsThis work aimed to boost the emotional and psychological literacy of the system. This will be important in the aftermath of the pandemic and could have many benefits thereafter.Social implicationsThe post-COVID-19 health-care workforce will experience significant challenges in terms of readjustment and recovery.

This study expanded on our previous work to compare the effects of receiving or not receiving a brief daily mindfulness-based practice in large-scale university courses. Data were collected from 88 participants enrolled in two third-year psychology courses at a university in Southwestern Ontario, Canada at the beginning and the end of the semester. The scripted 'Three-Minute Breathing Space' mindfulness intervention took less than 5 min of class time each day in one course, while the course not receiving the intervention served as a control group. By the end of the semester, the intervention group reported experiencing greater enhancements in positive emotionality, and fewer episodes of mind wandering and distractibility than those in the control group. In contrast, there was no detectable effect on mindfulness or negative emotionality in either group. Those receiving the intervention also reported enjoying the practice, and more than half had used the practice outside the course. Results of this study, and others, suggest that brief mindfulness practices taught in university courses may play a role in promoting mental wellness among students. Future work should consider how this brief practice may be applied more broadly and what other resources might be made available to students.",

We used lag correlations to examine second-by-second coherence between subjective emotional experience and heart period within individuals across four different films. Participants were either: (a) experienced Vipassana meditators (attention to visceral sensations), (b) experienced dancers (attention to somatic sensations), and (c) controls with no meditation or dance experience. Results indicated a linear relationship in coherence, with meditators having highest levels, dancers having intermediary levels, and controls having lowest levels.

Already in the course of university studies, medicine and psychology students report mental distress and low life satisfaction. There is a need for interventions that promote better coping skills in students in order to prevent distress and future burnout. This study examines the effect of a seven-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme on mental distress, study stress, burnout, subjective well-being, and mindfulness of medical and psychology students.Methods: A total of 288 students (mean age = 23 years, 76% female) from the University of Oslo and the University of Tromso were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The control group continued with their standard university courses and received no intervention. Participants were evaluated using self-reported measures both before and after the intervention. These were: the 'General Health Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory Student version, Perceived Medical School Stress, Subjective Well-being, and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire' and additional indices of compliance.Results: Following the intervention, a moderate effect on mental distress (Hedges'g 0.65, CI = .41, .88), and a small effect on both subjective well-being (Hedges'g 0.40, CI = .27, .63) and the mindfulness facet 'non-reacting' (Hedges'g 0.33, CI = .10, .56) were found in the intervention group compared with the control group. A higher level of programme attendance and reported mindfulness exercises predicted these changes. Significant effects were only found for female students who additionally reported reduced study stress and an increase in the mindfulness facet 'non-judging'. Gender specific effects of participation in the MBSR programme have not previously been reported, and gender differences in the present study are discussed.Conclusion: Female medical and psychology students experienced significant positive improvements in mental distress, study stress, subjective well-being and mindfulness after participating in the MBSR programme.",

However, the underlying neural mechanism and possible intervention strategies of group-based Mahayana Buddhist intervention involved in emotion regulation are still unclear. This event-related potential (ERP) study investigated how compassion and wisdom meditations, two key components of the Awareness Training Program (ATP), may regulate emotion during different mental processing stages, namely attention deployment, cognitive change, and response modification. Eighty-five middle-aged working adults with moderate stress were voluntarily recruited for this study, using a 128-channel electroencephalogram system. After 7 weeks of training, participants (ATP attendance, n = 42; waitlist control, n = 43) were instructed to view negative pictures while practicing compassion or wisdom meditation, with corresponding priming words. Another normal priming condition and a neutral picture condition were set as control conditions. ERP results in the ATP group showed that negative pictures induced greater prefrontal activity (N400 component) in both compassion and wisdom meditation conditions compared with the normal condition, while the control group showed little difference between the conditions. Significantly higher heart rate variability was found in the compassion but not wisdom meditation when compared with the neutral priming condition. Correspondent changes in behavioural data were also found. Converging evidence showed that compassion meditation training could modulate negative emotion processing in stages of attention deployment, cognitive change, and behavioural responses. The prefrontal lobe could play an important role in the process of emotion regulation by compassion meditation, possibly due to the emphasis of the ATP on contemplative practices.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: A symptom cluster is very common among oncological patients: cancer-related fatigue (CRF), emotional distress, sleep difficulties, pain, and cognitive difficulties. Clinical applications of interventions based on non-ordinary states of consciousness, mostly hypnosis and meditation, are starting to be investigated in oncology settings. They revealed encouraging results in terms of improvements of these symptoms. However, these studies often focused on breast cancer patients, with methodological limitations (e.g., small sample size, no control group, and no follow-up). Another non-ordinary state of consciousness may also have therapeutic applications in oncology: self-induced cognitive trance (SICT). It seems to differ from hypnosis and meditation, as it involves the body more directly. Thus, investigating its clinical applications, along with hypnosis and meditation interventions, could improve available therapeutic options in oncology. This article details the study protocol of a preference-based longitudinal controlled superiority trial aiming to assess the effectiveness of 3 group interventions (hypnosis, meditation, and SICT) to improve oncological patients' quality of life, and more specifically CRF, emotional distress, sleep, pain, and cognitive difficulties (primary outcomes). Methods and analysis: A power analysis required a total sample of 160 patients. Main inclusion criteria are: cancer diagnosis, active treatments completed for less than a year, no practice of hypnosis, meditation, or SICT, and presence of at least one of these four symptoms: fatigue, sleep difficulties, depression, or anxiety. Each participant will choose the intervention in which they want to participate (hypnosis, mindful self-compassion meditation, SICT, or no intervention-control group). To test the effectiveness of the interventions, data will be collected by questionnaires and neurobiological measures and directly from the medical record at four time points: before inclusion in the study (baseline); immediately after the intervention; and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. The longitudinal data in each group will then be measured. Discussion: In addition to standard cancer therapies, there is a growing interest from patients in complementary approaches, such as hypnosis, meditation, and SICT. The results of this study will be useful to increase knowledge about short- and long-term effectiveness of 3 group interventions for CRF, emotional distress, sleep, pain, and cognitive difficulties in patients with different cancers.

        "abstract": "Dispositional mindfulness is often linked to higher positive affect and lower negative affect, and coping with stress has been hypothesized to mediate these links. However, few studies have explicitly tested the ways in which stress appraisals, coping strategies, or coping flexibility (i.e., fit of coping to controllability appraisals) uniquely relate to mindfulness and well-being. Drawing on a stress and coping framework, the present study tested the degree to which (a) lower stress appraisals mediate mindfulness' effects on daily positive and negative affect; (b) daily coping mediates mindfulness' impact on daily positive and negative affect, above and beyond the effects of stress appraisals; and (c) coping flexibility mediates mindfulness' impact on positive and negative affect, above and beyond the effects of stress appraisals and average daily coping. Participants were 157 undergraduate students (mean age = 17.81; 79% women), completing daily diary questionnaires regarding stress appraisals, coping, and affect for 1 week. Results demonstrate that lower average stress appraisals mediated 19% of mindfulness' effects on negative affect; further, average use of some \"mindful\" emotion-focused coping strategies (i.e., non-self-blame and acceptance) independently mediated 3%-13% of mindfulness' effects on positive and negative affect. Although mindfulness was associated with greater \"fit\" of problem-focused versus acceptance coping to high controllability appraisals, coping flexibility did not appear to mediate mindfulness' effects on either positive or negative affect. Thus, mindfulness-based stress management interventions may be most effective by promoting mindful coping to complement, rather than replace, problem-focused coping.",

        "abstract": "Background: Meditation is increasingly showing beneficial effects for psychiatric disorders. However, learning to meditate is not straightforward as there are no easily discernible outward signs of performance and thus no direct feedback is possible. As meditation has been found to correlate with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity, we tested whether source-space EEG neurofeedback from the PCC followed the subjective experience of effortless awareness (a major component of meditation), and whether participants could volitionally control the signal.Methods: Sixteen novice meditators and sixteen experienced meditators participated in the study. Novice meditators were briefly trained to perform a basic meditation practice to induce the subjective experience of effortless awareness in a progressively more challenging neurofeedback test-battery. Experienced meditators performed a self-selected meditation practice to induce this state in the same test-battery. Neurofeedback was provided based on gamma-band (40-57 Hz) PCC activity extracted using a beamformer algorithm. Associations between PCC activity and the subjective experience of effortless awareness were assessed by verbal probes.Results: Both groups reported that decreased PCC activity corresponded with effortless awareness (P < 0.0025 for each group), with high median confidence ratings (novices: 8 on a 0-10 Likert scale; experienced: 9). Both groups showed high moment-to-moment median correspondence ratings between PCC activity and subjective experience of effortless awareness (novices: 8, experienced: 9). Both groups were able to volitionally control the PCC signal in the direction associated with effortless awareness by practicing effortless awareness meditation (novices: median % of time = 77.97, P = 0.001; experienced: 89.83, P < 0.0005).Conclusions: These findings support the feasibility of using EEG neurofeedback to link an objective measure of brain activity with the subjective experience of effortless awareness, and suggest potential utility of this paradigm as a tool for meditation training.",

        "title": "Compassion meditation increases optimism towards a transgressor",
        "abstract": "Past research reveals important connections between meditative practices and compassion. Most studies, however, focus on the effects of one type of meditation (vs. a no-intervention control) on a single expression of compassion (e.g. offering a seat) towards a relatable target (e.g. a person on crutches), without exploring possible mechanisms. Hence, few studies include different types of meditation, active controls, multiple ways to express compassion, unrelatable targets, and potential mediators. To this end, the present study compared the effects of mindfulness meditation with those of compassion meditation on different expressions of compassion towards a convicted murderer. Seventy-four participants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness meditation, compassion meditation, or active control class, or a no-class control. After an 8-week programme, we assessed compassion by giving participants the option of fulfilling a murderer's request that they write him and then coding those letters for empathy, sympathy, forgiveness, and optimism. Participants in the compassion meditation class wrote more optimistic letters compared to participants in the other three conditions, in part because they valued positivity more. No statistically significant differences emerged for the other expressions of compassion. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of how meditation increases compassion towards unrelatable targets.",

        "title": "The Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Fidelity Measure (MORE-FM): Development and Validation of a New Tool to Assess Therapist Adherence and Competence",
        "abstract": "Objective: Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) is a mind-body therapy that unites complementary aspects of mindfulness training, third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and principles from positive psychology into an integrative treatment for addiction and its comorbidities. As interest in MORE has grown among researchers and clinicians, there is an increasing need to provide quality assurance measures to ensure treatment integrity during implementation of MORE. Here, we describe the development and validation of the Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Fidelity Measure (MORE-FM).Method: We developed a 17-item scale assessing therapist competence and adherence to the MORE treatment manual, which was then used for fidelity monitoring of 40 MORE treatment sessions across two Stage 2 and two Stage 1 RCT for addictive behaviors (e.g., opioid misuse, obesity) involving a total N = 295.Results: Internal consistency for the Adherence (alpha =.89) and Competence subscales (alpha =.92) was high, and interrater reliability was adequate (Adherence subscale ICC =.77; Competence subscale ICC =.51), with therapists exhibiting good-to-excellent levels of fidelity across all trials. Importantly, linear mixed modeling indicated that higher levels of overall fidelity were associated with greater reductions in opioid misuse across two Stage 2 RCTs (F-1,F-48.00 = 7.38, p=.009), indicating that the MORE-FM is a valid measure of treatment fidelity that can predict clinical outcomes.Conclusions: Findings from this study yielded insights for future iterations of the MORE-FM. In sum, the MORE-FM is a valuable tool for assessing and enhancing the integrity of MORE in future research trials and clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Research suggests that mindfulness-practices may aid smoking cessation. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness-practices on smoking are unclear. Response inhibition is a main deficit in addiction, is associated with relapse, and could therefore be a candidate target for mindfulness-based practices. The current study hence investigated the effects of a brief mindfulness-practice on response inhibition in smokers using behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures. Fifty participants (33 females, mean age 20 years old) underwent a protocol of cigarette exposure to induce craving (cueexposure) and were then randomly assigned to a group receiving mindfulness-instructions or control-instructions (for 15 minutes approximately). Immediately after this, they performed a smoking Go/ NoGo task, while their brain activity was recorded. At the behavioral level, no group differences were observed. However, EEG analyses revealed a decrease in P3 amplitude during NoGo vs. Go trials in the mindfulness versus control group. The lower P3 amplitude might indicate less-effortful response inhibition after the mindfulness-practice, and suggest that enhanced response inhibition underlies observed positive effects of mindfulness on smoking behavior.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesEmpirical studies have shown that the Four Immeasurables Meditations (FIM) can enhance compassionate decisions towards others, such as helping victims being treated unfairly in economic games. However, research investigating how FIM affects individuals' decisions when they themselves are victims is sparse. Thus, the current study utilized a randomized trial to scrutinize the causal influence of practicing FIM on people's reactions towards unfairness that is directed at them.MethodsMeditation novices (N=135) were randomly assigned to practice either a brief Appreciative Joy Meditation (AJM) or a matched neutral visualization. They then took part in the Ultimatum Game where they first acted as a proposer to propose an offer to another person, then acted as a responder to decide whether to accept a set of offers.ResultsThe AJM group accepted significantly more unfair offers, but neither proposed a higher offer to others nor changed the perception of fairness, as compared with the neutral visualization control group. Furthermore, self-reported emotional changes during meditation practice could not predict behavior in the Ultimatum Game, but the Self-Transcendence dimension of the Appreciative Joy Scale, which reflects one's ability to feel happy for others when one is in an inferior situation, predicted higher acceptance rate of unfair offers.ConclusionsThis study provided a piece of causal evidence that a brief practice of AJM can make people more tolerable to unfairness directed against them. Broadly, this study also inspired more investigations on attitudes towards people in superior situations in future studies on FIM.",

Methods: We enrolled 40 nurses from September 2019 to December 2019, and divided them into a control group (N=20) and an observation group (N=20) using a random number table. The control group received routine training, based on which the observation group received breathing meditation training. We compared their sustained attention index, fatigue score, mindfulness attention awareness score, mental state score, work stress score, career satisfaction score, and career happiness index. Results: After training, the sustained attention response time was shorter at 8:00 and 18:00 in the observation group than in the control group (p < .05). The physical fatigue score, mental fatigue score, reduced activity score, reduced motivation score, and overall fatigue score of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (p < .05). The observation group had a higher mindfulness attention awareness score than did the control group (p < .05). The SAS and SDS scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (p < .05). The work stress score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group, whereas the career satisfaction score and career happiness index were higher (p < .05). Conclusion: Breathing meditation training can improve the sustained attention level and mindfulness attention awareness level, reduce the feeling of fatigue and work stress, help adjust the mental state, and enhance the career satisfaction and career happiness of nurses in the operating room.",

        "abstract": "Ample research suggests that social connection reliably generates positive emotions. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide implicated in social cognition and behavior, is one biological mechanism that may influence an individual's capacity to extract positive emotions from social contexts. Because variation in certain genes may indicate underlying neurobiological differences, we tested whether several SNPs in two genes related to oxytocin signaling would show effects on positive emotions that were context-specific, depending on sociality. For six weeks, a sample of mid-life adults (N = 122) participated in either socially-focused loving kindness training or mindfulness training. During this timespan they reported their positive emotions daily. Five SNPs within OXTR and CD38 were assayed, and each was tested for its individual effect on daily emotions. The hypothesized three-way interaction between time, training type, and genetic variability emerged: Individuals homozygous for the G allele of OXTR rs1042778 experienced gains in daily positive emotions from loving-kindness training, whereas individuals with the T allele did not experience gains in positive emotions with either training. These findings are among the first to show how genetic differences in oxytocin signaling may influence an individual's capacity to experience positive emotions as a result of a socially-focused intervention.

        "abstract": "Mindfulness is defined as \"paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally\". Mindfulness is associated with positive affect, life satisfaction, self-esteem, lower negative affect and rumination. Conversely, evidence suggests a relationship between nicotine dependence and psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to compare the levels of Mindfulness and Subjective Well-Being (SWB) between smokers and non-smokers. Ninety seven smokers and eighty four non-smokers participated in the study (n = 181). The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-BR) and the Subjective Well-Being Scale (SWBS) were used. In all the factors of SWBS, the total scores in the FFMQ-BR and in the facets of Observing and Non-Reactivity, the non-smokers scored higher than the smokers. This study suggests that smokers present lower levels of Mindfulness and SWB than non-smokers. Consequently, we propose that Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) may help smokers deal with treatment and abstinence by increasing their level of SWB.",

We observed general training-related improvements followed by multi-year returns toward pre-training levels. However, beneficial changes in two personality attributes (agreeableness and neuroticism) were of moderate effect size (d = 0.51 and d = 0.45, respectively) and were retained across the 7-year follow-up. We further found that individual variation in changes was represented by three latent attributes: (Changes related to) Mindful Well-being, Resilient Extraversion, and Self-Compassionate Openness.

        "abstract": "College students are exposed to daily stressors throughout their academic careers, which can have lasting consequences to their health and well-being. Mindfulness practices, art therapy, and the simple act of manipulating clay have independently demonstrated positive effects on stress and anxiety, but there is little research on the feasibility of incorporating these into an online resource for students to proactively address their mental health. In this pilot study, full-time university students (N = 15) were randomly assigned to a mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) program that used clay for all art directives or an unstructured, undirected neutral clay-manipulating task (NCT) for 10 weeks. Anxiety symptoms, salivary cortisol concentrations, and perceived levels of stress were assessed. Within-group analysis demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety symptoms and cortisol concentrations for MBAT participants, with no significant decrease in perceived stress. NCT participants experienced a significant decrease in cortisol concentrations on Week 1 but not on Week 10, with no other statistical significance in outcomes detected. Between-group analysis generated no significant interactions between variables. Based on these results, the structure of a therapist-directed online MBAT program using clay has the capacity to elicit anxiety-reducing benefits and may produce a trained biofeedback response for combating stress, offering a feasible strategy for addressing the mental health crisis on college campuses.",

This paper provides a comprehensive account of therapy personalisation within this targeted approach. Design Case examples illustrate therapy delivery and descriptive data are presented on personalised thought content. Method Thought content was extracted from the webapp (n = 140 participants) and coded using newly devised categories: Worries: (1) Persecutory, (2) Negative social evaluation, (3) Negative self-concept, (4) Loss/life stresses, (5) Sensory-perceptual experiences and (6) Health anxieties. Safer thoughts: (1) Safer alternative (specific alternatives to worries), (2) Second-wave (generalised) coping, (3) Positive self-concept, (4) Positive activities and (5) Third-wave (mindfulness-based) coping. Data on therapy fidelity are also presented. Results Worries: 'Persecutory' (92.9% of people) and 'Negative social evaluation' (74.3%) were most common. 'General worries/ life stresses' (31.4%) and 'Negative self-concept' (22.1%) were present in a significant minority; 'Health anxieties' (10%) and 'Sensory-perceptual' (10%) were less common. Safer thoughts: 'Second-wave (general) coping' (85%), 'Safer alternatives' (76.4%), 'Positive self-concept' (65.7%) and 'Positive activities' (64.3%) were common with 'Third-wave' (mindfulness) coping observed for 30%. Fidelity: Only three therapy withdrawals were therapy related. Session adherence was excellent (mean = 15.2/16; SD = 0.9). Behavioural work was conducted with 71% of people (119/168). Conclusion SlowMo therapy delivers a targeted yet personalised approach. Potential mechanisms of action extend beyond reasoning. Implications for cognitive models of paranoia and causal interventionist approaches are discussed.",

In Saudi Arabia, literature is insufficient about MBSR and its effectiveness. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of MBSR in improving mindful state, stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students. Also, the study explores the association between the attendance rate of MBSR sessions and its effectiveness. Lastly, the study examines gender differences in response to MBSR.MethodsThis is a stratified randomized controlled study of 84 medical students from two medical schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They were recruited voluntarily from November 2018 to April 2021, and allocated to MBSR and waitlist groups using a stratified randomization method based on gender. MBSR group received eight weeks of sessions through audiovisual materials. An online survey utilizing validated questionnaires assessing stress, mindfulness, anxiety, and depression was used to evaluate both groups pre-program (time 0), post-program (time 1), and three months later (time 2).ResultsSeventy-one participants completed the post-test (time 1). There were no differences between study groups at time 0 and 1. However, in 41 subjects who completed the follow-up test (time 2), the anxiety dropped significantly in MBSR group (mean difference (MD), -3.935; 95% CI, -7.580 to -0.290). Furthermore, attending more MBSR sessions was inversely correlated with depression (r, -0.556; P, 0.002), and anxiety (r, -0.630; P, 0.000).

Therefore, these patients should be introduced to positive coping strategies. Evidences have showed that mindfulness-based interventions can positively impact the psychology of patients with mental disorders. This study was to explore the impact of a combination of mindfulness therapy and mentalization-based family therapy (MBFT) on suicidal ideation in adolescents with depressive disorder. Methods Eighty adolescent patients with depression and suicidal ideation admitted to our hospital from September 2021 to February 2022 were selected as subjects. They were divided into a control group and a study group using the random number table method, with each group comprising 40 subjects. The control group received MBFT, whereas the study group received both mindfulness therapy and MBFT. The psychological status and suicidal ideations of the two groups were compared before and after the intervention. Results The psychological health scores of both groups of patients were lower after the intervention, with the scores of the study group being lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The scores on the suicidal ideation scales for both groups were lower after intervention, and the study group scored lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The absolute values of the differences in psychological health scale scores and suicidal ideation scale scores before and after the intervention were higher in the study group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion The combination of mindfulness therapy and MBFT can improve the psychological condition of adolescents with depression, reduce their suicidal ideations, and help them develop a healthy and positive outlook toward life, making this method worthy of clinical recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation has been shown to promote emotional stability. Moreover, during the processing of aversive and self-referential stimuli, mindful awareness is associated with reduced medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity, a central default mode network (DMN) component. However, it remains unclear whether mindfulness practice influences functional connectivity between DMN regions and, if so, whether such impact persists beyond a state of meditation. Consequently, this study examined the effect of extensive mindfulness training on functional connectivity within the DMN during a restful state. Resting-state data were collected from 13 experienced meditators (with over 1000 h of training) and 11 beginner meditators (with no prior experience, trained for 1 week before the study) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Pairwise correlations and partial correlations were computed between DMN seed regions' time courses and were compared between groups utilizing a Bayesian sampling scheme. Relative to beginners, experienced meditators had weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions involved in self-referential processing and emotional appraisal. In addition, experienced meditators had increased connectivity between certain DMN regions (e.g. dorso-medial PFC and right inferior parietal lobule), compared to beginner meditators. These findings suggest that meditation training leads to functional connectivity changes between core DMN regions possibly reflecting strengthened present-moment awareness.",

The primary outcome was health-related psychological quality of life. Secondary measures were environmental, social and physical health related quality of life, frequency and intensity of psychotic symptoms and daily-life mindfulness.Method: Forty-four patients from a public community rehabilitation center for people with severe mental illness were recruited, and randomly allocated to Integrated Rehabilitation Treatment (IRT) or IRT plus MBI. Measures included PANSS interview, WHOQOL-BREF, and Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale. MBI comprised 26 one-hour weekly sessions. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.Results: One patient did not complete IRT + MBI and two did not complete IRT. At baseline there were no statistical group differences in demographic characteristics or primary and secondary outcomes. At post-treatment interaction between treatment and time in health-related psychological quality of life was statistically significant, and simple effect analysis showed significant differences for between and within subject factor in favor of MBI. Interaction was also significant in PANSS negative symptoms, simple effects showed a statistical trend in within subject factor. Time factor was significant in environmental and physical quality of life.Conclusions: Data suggest mindfulness added to IRT may enhance psychological quality of life in people with severe mental illness from a public community center. Results also suggest that mindfulness may impact frequency and intensity of negative symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Cultivating connectedness: Effects of an app-based compassion meditation course on changes in global identity, nature connectedness, and pro-environmental behaviour",
        "abstract": "Individual behaviour change and political measures are required to solve pressing global environmental crises such as climate change. Identification with an ingroup that includes all humanity (i.e., a global identity) was positively related to pro-environmental engagement in various studies, but little is known about how to foster a global identity. We argue that meditation with a focus on cultivating compassion might increase global identity because connectedness with people all over the world is a traditional goal of such practice. In a randomised controlled intervention study with pre-post design (N =164, Germany), participants received an app-based 7-day meditation course. Controlling for pre-survey levels, compared to the waiting control group, the meditation group reported stronger changes in global identity and pro-environmental behaviour but not climate policy support. We found that participating in the meditation course indirectly predicted changes in pro-environmental behaviour through a strengthened global self-investment, as one dimension of global identity. Moreover, we also found stronger changes in nature connectedness in the meditation group compared to the control group. Hence, a 7-day app-based compassion meditation course indeed seems to cultivate connectedness - with both humans and the broader natural world. Future research should compare different course curricula. Moreover, it should aim at diverse samples, longitudinal assessments, and investigate reasons for self-selecting in and dropping out of meditation-related studies.",

        "title": "Meditation and the cultivation of virtue",
        "abstract": "In recent decades, social psychology has produced an expansive array of studies wherein introducing a seemingly morally innocuous feature into the situation a subject inhabits often yields morally questionable, dubious, or even appalling behavior. Several fascinating lines of philosophical enquiry issue from this research, but the most pragmatically salient question concerns how we ought most effectively to develop and maintain the virtues so that such putatively morally problematic behavior is less likely to occur. In this paper, I examine four empirically embedded accounts of virtue cultivation: Hagop Sarkissian's social signaling, Mark Alfano's virtue labeling, Nancy Snow's self-punishment, and Peter Railton's implementation intentions. But none of these accounts of virtue cultivation provides adequate resources for regulating our affective states, whose attention-constricting and behavior-priming functional roles are likely at the root of much of our less than virtuous behavior. Instead, I defend an account of virtue cultivation that proceeds via meditation, which can help us to identify and regulate our emotions and moods. Further, meditation enables us to develop the attentional focus, emotional intelligence, and sense of social connection that ground (many of) the virtues and, thus, our virtuous behavior.",

        "abstract": "In French universities, only one out of two students is successful in his/her first year. The change of the working rhythm and the importance of self-regulated learning (relying on metacognition) can to a large extent explain these dramatic rates. Metacognition, as the process of being aware of one's own cognition and activity implies awareness and consciousness. Nowadays, its improvement has only been achieved through the training of monitoring for a specific task. Regarding awareness, techniques like meditation and relaxation (attentional practices or APs) lead to its general development. Therefore, we investigated the possible improvement of metacognition thanks to AP. We conducted a longitudinal study with two groups of students: one group took a training programme in autogenic training (an AP), and the second one received no training in awareness or metacognition. We found out that metacognition could be improved thanks to an AP. This approach could therefore be used as a global metacognitive remediation for students.",

        "title": "The Nondiscriminating Heart: Lovingkindness Meditation Training Decreases Implicit Intergroup Bias",
        "abstract": "Although meditation is increasingly accepted as having personal benefits, less is known about the broader impact of meditation on social and intergroup relations. We tested the effect of lovingkindness meditation training on improving implicit attitudes toward members of 2 stigmatized social outgroups: Blacks and homeless people. Healthy non-Black, nonhomeless adults (N = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 6-week lovingkindness practice, 6-week lovingkindness discussion (a closely matched active control), or waitlist control. Decreases in implicit bias against stigmatized outgroups (as measured by Implicit Association Test) were observed only in the lovingkindness practice condition. Reduced psychological stress mediated the effect of lovingkindness practice on implicit bias against homeless people, but it did not mediate the reduced bias against Black people. These results suggest that lovingkindness meditation can improve automatically activated, implicit attitudes toward stigmatized social groups and that this effect occurs through distinctive mechanisms for different stigmatized social groups.",

        "title": "Exploring the Embodied Mind: Functional Connectome Fingerprinting of Meditation Expertise",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short mindfulness-based interventions have gained traction in research due to their positive impact on well-being, cognition, and clinical symptoms across various settings. However, these short-term trainings are viewed as preliminary steps within a more extensive transformative path, presumably leading to long-lasting trait changes. Despite this, little is still known about the brain correlates of these meditation traits. METHODS: To address this gap, we investigated the neural correlates of meditation expertise in long-term Buddhist practitioners, comparing the large-scale brain functional connectivity of 28 expert meditators with 47 matched novices. Our hypothesis posited that meditation expertise would be associated with specific and enduring patterns of functional connectivity present during both meditative (open monitoring/open presence and loving- kindness and compassion meditations) and nonmeditative resting states, as measured by connectivity gradients. RESULTS: Applying a support vector classifier to states not included in training, we successfully decoded expertise as a trait, demonstrating its non-state-dependent nature. The signature of expertise was further characterized by an increased integration of large-scale brain networks, including the dorsal and ventral attention, limbic, frontoparietal, and somatomotor networks. The latter correlated with a higher ability to create psychological distance from thoughts and emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Such heightened integration of bodily maps with affective and attentional networks in meditation experts could point toward a signature of the embodied cognition cultivated in these contemplative practices.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveDepression is associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer patients, with higher prevalence among younger women. Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated therapeutic effects, the mechanisms of intervention effects are poorly understood. We investigated whether rumination, self-kindness, intrusive thoughts about cancer, cancer-related worry, or a sense of meaning and peace mediated the intervention effects of an MBI, Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs), on depressive symptoms. Additionally, we explored the same variables as mediators of a psychoeducation program, Survivorship Education (SE). Methods Women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer at age <50 years were randomized to 6 weeks of MAPs (n = 85), SE (n = 81), or wait-list control (WLC; n = 81). During preintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up (FU), we assessed depressive symptoms, rumination, self-kindness, intrusive thoughts, worry, and meaning and peace. Results MAPs and SE significantly reduced depressive symptoms at postintervention, and reductions remained through 6-month FU for MAPs. Models revealed that reductions in rumination (beta = -0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.64 to -0.07) and intrusive thoughts (beta = 1.17, 95% CI = -2.17 to -0.37) and improvements in self-kindness (beta = -1.09, 95% CI = -2.37 to -0.28) and meaning and peace (beta = -1.09, 95% CI = -3.16 to -0.56) mediated MAPs' effects at all time points. Reductions in worry (beta = -1.34, 95% CI = -2.47 to -0.45]) mediated effects at postintervention only. Worry and intrusive thoughts mediated SE effects at postintervention and 6-month FU, respectively. Conclusions Findings identified depression-relevant mediators of MAPs' effects, expanding the understanding of MBI mechanisms.

        "abstract": "BackgroundSystematic reviews and meta-analyses reveal the importance of an accepting attitude towards cancer for mental health and functional coping. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the German translation of the Peace, Equanimity, and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience (PEACE) questionnaire (Mack et al., 2008) and to investigate its associations with mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and related constructs.MethodsThe German version of the PEACE (PEACE-G) was created and validated with cancer patients in a cross-sectional two center questionnaire study. Construct validity was tested with confirmational factor analyses (CFA); Cronbach's alpha was used to determine internal consistency of items. We further examined associations with depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), distress (NCCN distress thermometer), HRQoL (SF-12), psychological flexibility (AAQ-II), resilience (RS-11) and acceptance scales, to evaluate concurrent and divergent validity.ResultsN = 213 cancer patients with different tumor entities participated in this study. Results of the CFA replicated the two-factor solution of the original PEACE (peaceful acceptance and struggle with illness) with satisfactory psychometric properties. Peaceful acceptance showed negative associations with depression, anxiety, distress, psychological inflexibility, and positive associations with HRQoL, acceptance, resilience, and mindfulness. Results of sensitivity analyses indicate a third factor (injustice/anger).ConclusionsThe results demonstrate the validity and reliability of PEACE-G in cancer patients and point to the essential role of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions in psycho-oncology.

        "title": "Individual Differences in the Relationship Between Attachment and Nomophobia Among College Students: The Mediating Role of Mindfulness.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in nomophobia, which is defined as the fear of being out of cellular phone contact, or \"feelings of discomfort or anxiety experienced by individuals when they are unable to use their mobile phones or utilize the affordances these devices provide\". However, only limited research can be found in terms of its determinants at present. Contemporary literature suggests that the relationships among attachment styles, mindfulness, and nomophobia have not been investigated.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the mediating effect of mindfulness on the relationship between attachment and nomophobia. In addition, the study also focuses on gender differences in attachment, mindfulness, and nomophobia. A theory-based structural model was tested to understand the essentials of the associations between the constructs.METHODS: The Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, Nomophobia Questionnaire, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale were used to collect data from undergraduate students (N=450; 70.9% women [319/450]; mean age=21.94 years [SD 3.61]). Two measurement models (ie, attachment and mindfulness) and a structural model were specified, estimated, and evaluated.RESULTS: The structural equation model shows that the positive direct effects of avoidant (.13, P=.03) and anxious attachment (.48, P<.001) on nomophobia were significant. The negative direct effects of avoidant (-.18, P=.01) and anxious attachment (-.33, P<.001) on mindfulness were also significant. Moreover, mindfulness has a significant negative effect on nomophobia for women only (-.13, P=.03). Finally, the Sobel test showed that the indirect effects of avoidant and anxious attachment on nomophobia via mindfulness were significant (P<.001). The direct and indirect effects of anxious attachment, avoidant attachment, and mindfulness altogether accounted for 33% of the total variance in nomophobia. Gender comparison results show that there is a significant difference in attachment based on gender (F2,447=6.97, P=.01, Wilk lambda=.97, partial eta2=.03). Women (mean 68.46 [SD 16.96]) scored significantly higher than men (mean 63.59 [SD 15.97]) in anxious attachment (F1=7.93, P=.01, partial eta2=.02). Gender differences in mindfulness were not significant (F4,448=3.45, P=.69). On the other hand, results do show significant gender differences in nomophobia (F4,445=2.71, P=.03, Wilk lambda=.98, partial eta2=.02) where women scored significantly higher than men.CONCLUSIONS: In general, individuals who are emotionally more dependent and crave more closeness and attention in the relationship tend to display higher levels of fear or discomfort when they have no access to their mobile phones. However, gender has a differential impact on the relationship between avoidant attachment and nomophobia. This study establishes the impact of mindfulness on nomophobia for women; therefore, future studies should test the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy approaches and confirm whether they are effective and efficient. On the basis of significant gender difference in nomophobia and attachment, we conclude that gender should be taken into account in mindfulness-based treatments dealing with nomophobia.",

        "title": "Neural responses underlying extraordinary altruists' generosity for socially distant others",
        "abstract": "Most people are much less generous toward strangers than close others, a bias termed social discounting. But people who engage in extraordinary real-world altruism, like altruistic kidney donors, show dramatically reduced social discounting. Why they do so is unclear. Some prior research suggests reduced social discounting requires effortfully overcoming selfishness via recruitment of the temporoparietal junction. Alternatively, reduced social discounting may reflect genuinely valuing strangers' welfare more due to how the subjective value of their outcomes is encoded in regions such as rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala. We tested both hypotheses in this pre-registered study. We also tested the hypothesis that a loving-kindness meditation (LKM) training intervention would cause typical adults' neural and behavioral patterns to resemble altruists. Altruists and matched controls (N = 77) completed a social discounting task during functional magnetic resonance imaging; 25 controls were randomized to complete LKM training. Neither behavioral nor imaging analyses supported the hypothesis that altruists' reduced social discounting reflects effortfully overcoming selfishness. Instead, group differences emerged in social value encoding regions, including rostral ACC and amygdala. Activation in these regions corresponded to the subjective valuation of others' welfare predicted by the social discounting model. LKM training did not result in more generous behavioral or neural patterns, but only greater perceived difficulty during social discounting. Our results indicate extraordinary altruists' generosity results from the way regions involved in social decision-making encode the subjective value of others' welfare. Interventions aimed at promoting generosity may thus succeed to the degree they can increase the subjective valuation of others' welfare.",

Our hypothesis was that both mindfulness skills and decision-making performance would improve in pilots who participated in the ARO program (n = 7), compared to a control group (n = 8). Mindfulness skills were measured with the FFMQ-15. Decision-making performance was evaluated in two tests that were implemented in scenarios in a full flight simulator. Five dependent variables were assessed, corresponding to the phases of the decision-making process when faced with an in-flight failure: reaction time after the first failure input, correctness of the first action, emergency procedure score, ejection procedure score, and quality of ejection. Adherence to the ARO program was assessed with the number of out-of-class individual mindfulness sessions and the number of out-of-class body-mind scans. No statistically significant improvement in mindfulness skills for the ARO group compared to the control group were found. Reaction time was significantly shortened for the ARO group compared to the control group-but only for complex failures. A positive effect on the correctness of the first action was also found. On the other hand, ARO training had no significant effect on the downstream phases of decision-making (emergency pro-cedure score, ejection procedure score and quality of ejection). Given the small sample size, these results must be considered with caution. However, they open up interesting avenues for future work, notably with regard to the benefits of mindfulness training on perceptual and atten-tional skills (to detect flight failure cues) and cognitive control skills (to diagnose and select appropriate pro-cedures). From an operational perspective, the program appears to have beneficial effects on safety and performance in elite populations who must face critical situations.",

We aimed to evaluate the effect of a structured Mediterranean diet intervention on the cortical structure of the maternal brain during pregnancy. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of the IMPACT BCN, a randomized clinical trial with 1221 high-risk pregnant women randomly allocated into three groups at 19-23 weeks of gestation: Mediterranean diet intervention, a mindfulness-based stress reduction program, or usual care. Maternal brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed during the third trimester of pregnancy in a random subgroup of participants. For this study, data from the Mediterranean diet and usual groups were analyzed. Maternal dietary intake, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and metabolite biomarkers were evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire, a 17-item dietary screener and plasma/urine samples, respectively. RESULTS: The cluster-wise analysis showed that the Mediterranean diet group participants (n = 34) had significantly larger surface areas in the right precuneus (90%CI: <0.0001-0.0004, p < 0.001) and left superior parietal (90%CI: 0.026-0.033, p = 0.03) lobules compared to the usual care group participants (n = 37). A larger right precuneus area was associated with high improvements in adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a high intake of walnuts and high concentrations of urinary hydroxytyrosol. A larger left superior parietal area was associated with a high intake of walnuts and high concentrations of urinary hydroxytyrosol.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: College students experience high levels of stress. Mindfulness meditation delivered via a mobile app may be an appealing, efficacious way to reduce stress in college students. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the initial efficacy and sustained effects of an 8-week mindfulness meditation mobile app-Calm-compared to a wait-list control on stress, mindfulness, and self-compassion in college students with elevated stress. We also explored the intervention's effect on health behaviors (ie, sleep disturbance, alcohol consumption [binge drinking], physical activity, and healthy eating [fruit and vegetable consumption]) and the feasibility and acceptability of the app. METHODS: This study was a randomized, wait-list, control trial with assessments at baseline, postintervention (8 weeks), and at follow-up (12 weeks). Participants were eligible if they were current full-time undergraduate students and (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) scored \u226514 points on the Perceived Stress Scale, (3) owned a smartphone, (4) were willing to download the Calm app, (5) were willing to be randomized, and (7) were able to read and understand English. Participants were asked to meditate using Calm at least 10 minutes per day. A P value <=.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 88 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age (SD) was 20.41 (2.31) years for the intervention group and 21.85 (6.3) years for the control group. There were significant differences in all outcomes (stress, mindfulness, and self-compassion) between the intervention and control groups after adjustment for covariates postintervention (all P<.04). These effects persisted at follow-up (all P<.03), except for the nonreacting subscale of mindfulness (P=.08). There was a significant interaction between group and time factors in perceived stress (P=.002), mindfulness (P<.001), and self-compassion (P<.001). Bonferroni posthoc tests showed significant within-group mean differences for perceived stress in the intervention group (P<.001), while there were no significant within-group mean differences in the control group (all P>.19). Similar results were found for mindfulness and self-compassion. Effect sizes ranged from moderate (0.59) to large (1.24) across all outcomes. A significant group*time interaction in models of sleep disturbance was found, but no significant effects were found for other health behaviors. The majority of students in the intervention group reported that Calm was helpful to reduce stress and stated they would use Calm in the future. The majority were satisfied using Calm and likely to recommend it to other college students. The intervention group participated in meditation for an average of 38 minutes/week during the intervention and 20 minutes/week during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Calm is an effective modality to deliver mindfulness meditation in order to reduce stress and improve mindfulness and self-compassion in stressed college students. Our findings provide important information that can be applied to the design of future studies or mental health resources in university programs.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an effective treatment for remitted and currently depressed patients. It is, however, unknown whether MBCT is effective for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients. METHOD: A pragmatic, multicenter, randomized-controlled trial was conducted comparing treatment-as-usual (TAU) with MBCT + TAU in 106 chronically depressed outpatients who previously received pharmacotherapy (\u22654 weeks) and psychological treatment (\u226510 sessions). RESULTS: Based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, participants in the MBCT + TAU condition did not have significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those in the TAU condition (-3.23 [-6.99 to 0.54], d = 0.35, P = 0.09) at posttreatment. However, compared to TAU, the MBCT + TAU group reported significantly higher remission rates (\u03c7(2) (2) = 4.25, \u03c6 = 0.22, P = 0.04), lower levels of rumination (-3.85 [-7.55 to -0.15], d = 0.39, P = 0.04), a higher quality of life (4.42 [0.03-8.81], d = 0.42, P = 0.048), more mindfulness skills (11.25 [6.09-16.40], d = 0.73, P < 0.001), and more self-compassion (2.91 [1.17-4.65], d = 0.64, P = 0.001). The percentage of non-completers in the MBCT + TAU condition was relatively high (n = 12, 24.5%).

CONCLUSION: Although the ITT analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in depressive symptoms of MBCT + TAU over TAU, MBCT + TAU seems to have beneficial effects for chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients in terms of remission rates, rumination, quality of life, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Additionally, patients who completed MBCT showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms. Reasons for non-completion should be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness meditation has met increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy for anxiety disorders, but prior studies have been limited by methodological concerns, including a lack of an active comparison group. This is the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the manualized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program with an active control for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a disorder characterized by chronic worry and physiologic hyperarousal symptoms. METHOD: Ninety-three individuals with DSM-IV-diagnosed GAD were randomly assigned to an 8-week group intervention with MBSR or to an attention control, Stress Management Education (SME), between 2009 and 2011. Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA; primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement scales (CGI-S and CGI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Stress reactivity was assessed by comparing anxiety and distress during pretreatment and posttreatment administration of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). RESULTS: A modified intent-to-treat analysis including participants who completed at least 1 session of MBSR (n = 48) or SME (n = 41) showed that both interventions led to significant (P < .0001) reductions in HAMA scores at endpoint, but did not significantly differ. MBSR, however, was associated with a significantly greater reduction in anxiety as measured by the CGI-S, the CGI-I, and the BAI (all P values < .05). MBSR was also associated with greater reductions than SME in anxiety and distress ratings in response to the TSST stress challenge (P < .05) and a greater increase in positive self-statements (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MBSR may have a beneficial effect on anxiety symptoms in GAD and may also improve stress reactivity and coping as measured in a laboratory stress challenge.

The evidence for efficacy, feasibility, and safety of virtually delivered yoga for patients with IBS is unknown. METHODS: Adults diagnosed with IBS were randomized to either Hatha yoga intervention of 8 weekly online classes delivered virtually or an advice-only control group and assessed at baseline and postintervention. We used an unadjusted ANOVA to determine differences between and within groups on the primary outcome (decrease of \u226550 points in IBS Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS]) and secondary outcomes (quality of life, anxiety and depression, fatigue, somatic symptoms, perceived stress, COVID-19 stress, and self-compassion). We assessed feasibility through recruitment and attrition rates, adherence, participant satisfaction, and safety (i.e., adverse events). RESULTS: Seventy-nine people participated (mean age 45.4 years [SD = 14.0], 92% women, 20% attrition rate). IBS-SSS decreased significantly in the treatment group (\u0394 change = 54.7, P = 0.028), but not in the control group (\u0394 change = 22.6, P = 0.277). Fourteen patients (37%) in the yoga group reached a clinically relevant decrease of \u226550 points on the IBS-SSS postintervention compared with 8 patients (20%) in the control group ( P = 0.242). No significant difference was found between groups in IBS-SSS score postintervention ( P = 0.149), but significant differences in favor of the treatment group for quality of life ( P = 0.030), fatigue ( P = 0.035), and perceived stress ( P = 0.040) were identified. The yoga program demonstrated feasibility. Intention to practice yoga decreased significantly in both groups from baseline to postintervention ( P < 0.001). However, the decline in intention did not correlate with practice minutes. DISCUSSION: Virtually delivered yoga is safe and feasible, and effective in reducing IBS symptoms. Based on the primary end point, the intervention was not superior to an advice-only control group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health care workers experience high stress. Accessible, affordable, and effective approaches to reducing stress are lacking. In-person mindfulness-based interventions can reduce health care worker stress but are not widely available or accessible to busy health care workers. Unguided, digital, mindfulness-based self-help (MBSH) interventions show promise and can be flexibly engaged with. However, their effectiveness in reducing health care worker stress has not yet been explored in a definitive trial. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an unguided digital MBSH app (Headspace) in reducing health care worker stress. METHODS: This was a definitive superiority randomized controlled trial with 2182 National Health Service staff in England recruited on the web and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to fully automated Headspace (n=1095, 50.18%) or active control (Moodzone; n=1087, 49.82%) for 4.5 months. Outcomes were subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (primary outcome) Scale short form; Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; Maslach Burnout Inventory; 15-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire minus Observe items; Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form; Compassionate Love Scale; Penn State Worry Questionnaire; Brooding subscale of the Ruminative Response Scale; and sickness absence. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses found that Headspace led to greater reductions in stress over time than Moodzone (b=-0.31, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.14; P<.001), with small effects. Small effects of Headspace versus Moodzone were found for depression (b=-0.24, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.08; P=.003), anxiety (b=-0.19, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.06; P=.004), well-being (b=0.14, 95% CI 0.05-0.23; P=.002), mindfulness (b=0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.34; P=.001), self-compassion (b=0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.64; P<.001), compassion for others (b=0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.04; P=.04), and worry (b=-0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.09; P=.005) but not for burnout (b=-0.19, -0.04, and 0.13, all 95% CIs >0; P=.65, .67, and .35), ruminative brooding (b=-0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.00; P=.06), or sickness absence (\u03b3=0.09, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.34). Per-protocol effects of Headspace (454/1095, 41.46%) versus Moodzone (283/1087, 26.03%) over time were found for stress, self-compassion, and compassion for others but not for the other outcomes. Engagement (practice days per week) and improvements in self-compassion during the initial 1.5-month intervention period mediated pre- to postintervention improvements in stress. Improvements in mindfulness, rumination, and worry did not mediate pre- to postintervention improvements in stress. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: An unguided digital MBSH intervention (Headspace) can reduce health care workers' stress. Effect sizes were small but could have population-level benefits. Unguided digital MBSH interventions can be part of the solution to reducing health care worker stress alongside potentially costlier but potentially more effective in-person mindfulness-based interventions, nonmindfulness courses, and organizational-level interventions.

        "title": "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness Versus Yoga: Effects on Depression and/or Anxiety in College Students.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders are two of the most common mental disorders in the United States. These disorders are prevalent among college students. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different types of intervention practices (mindfulness vs. yoga) and a noninterventional control group in mitigating the effects of depression and/or anxiety in college students. METHOD: A sample of 90 students (both genders) over age 18 who had a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression was recruited from 11,500 undergraduate college students in a mid-size university. The study's design included stratified-randomized controlled repeated measures with three groups: a mindfulness intervention group, a yoga-only intervention group, and a noninterventional group. Participants were randomly assigned to the aforementioned three groups. Participants in the intervention groups received an 8-week training either in mindfulness or yoga. Depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms, self-compassion, and mindfulness were measured at baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12. RESULTS: Depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms decreased significantly (p < .01) from baseline to follow-up conditions in both the mindfulness and yoga intervention groups. The changes in mindfulness scores were also significant in both groups. However, the changes in self-compassion scores were significant only in the mindfulness intervention group. No significant changes in the control group were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study can provide useful information to nurses and other health care providers. This study may have implications for a cost-effective treatment for depression and anxiety.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Quality of life (QOL) of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is reported to be the lowest among skin diseases. To our knowledge, mindfulness and self-compassion training has not been evaluated for adults with AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness and self-compassion training in improving the QOL for adults with AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2019 through October 2022 included adults with AD whose Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score, a skin disease-specific QOL measure, was greater than 6 (corresponding to moderate or greater impairment). Participants were recruited from multiple outpatient institutes in Japan and through the study's social media outlets and website. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive eight 90-minute weekly group sessions of online mindfulness and self-compassion training or to a waiting list. Both groups were allowed to receive any dermatologic treatment except dupilumab. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in the DLQI score from baseline to week 13. Secondary outcomes included eczema severity, itch- and scratching-related visual analog scales, self-compassion and all of its subscales, mindfulness, psychological symptoms, and participants' adherence to dermatologist-advised treatments. RESULTS: The study randomized 107 adults to the intervention group (n = 56) or the waiting list (n = 51). The overall participant mean (SD) age was 36.3 (10.5) years, 85 (79.4%) were women, and the mean (SD) AD duration was 26.6 (11.7) years. Among participants from the intervention group, 55 (98.2%) attended 6 or more of the 8 sessions, and 105 of all participants (98.1%) completed the assessment at 13 weeks. The intervention group demonstrated greater improvement in the DLQI score at 13 weeks (between-group difference estimate, -6.34; 95% CI, -8.27 to -4.41; P < .001). The standardized effect size (Cohen d) at 13 weeks was -1.06 (95% CI, -1.39 to -0.74). All secondary outcomes showed greater improvements in the intervention group than in the waiting list group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of adults with AD, integrated online mindfulness and self-compassion training in addition to usual care resulted in greater improvement in skin disease-specific QOL and other patient-reported outcomes, including eczema severity. These findings suggest that mindfulness and self-compassion training is an effective treatment option for adults with AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier: UMIN000036277.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Younger women are at risk for depression and related symptoms following breast cancer. The Pathways to Wellness study, a randomized, multi-institution, three-arm trial, tested the efficacy of two behavioral interventions for younger breast cancer survivors with elevated depressive symptoms: mindful awareness practices (MAPs) and survivorship education (SE) (Clincaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139). METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before 50 years of age who had completed treatment and had elevated depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of MAPs, SE, or wait-list control (WLC). Assessments were conducted preintervention and postintervention and at 3-month and 6-month postintervention follow-ups. Analyses compared each intervention to WLC using linear mixed models. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale; secondary outcomes included change in fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven women (median age = 46 years) were randomly assigned to MAPs (n = 85), SE (n = 81), or WLC (n = 81). MAPs and SE led to significant decreases in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention relative to WLC (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, -4.7 [-7.5 to -1.9]; SE, -4.0 [-6.9 to -1.1]), which persisted at 6-month follow-up for MAPs (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, -3.7 [-6.6 to -0.8]; SE, -2.8 [-5.9 to 0.2]). MAPs, but not SE, also had beneficial effects on fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms that persisted at 6-month follow-up (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness meditation and SE reduced depressive symptoms in younger breast cancer survivors. These interventions can be widely disseminated over virtual platforms and have significant potential benefit for quality of life and overall survivorship in this vulnerable group.",

As there are no evidence-based interventions for PAP-associated claustrophobia, the objective of the present research is to pilot test Mindfulness-based Exposure for PAP-associated Claustrophobia, in sleep apnea adults that present with treatment non-adherence and claustrophobia. This approach combines Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction with exposure-based treatment components to target this treatment-associated claustrophobia. The present article outlines the mindfulness exposure intervention design and methods and reports the pilot trial study protocol. Trial findings are intended to: (a) develop a preliminary effect size of the intervention on PAP-associated claustrophobia; (b) explore differences in treatment adherence by group (intervention vs control); and (c) establish feasibility for expanded protocol implementation, delivery, and participant acceptability of the intervention to support subsequent design of a fully powered randomized controlled trial.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Physicians and medical students are subject to higher levels of psychological distress than the general population. These challenges have a negative impact in medical practice, leading to uncompassionate care. This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility of Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) to reduce psychological distress and improve the well-being of medical students. We hypothesize that the CCT program, as compared to a waitlist control group, will reduce psychological distress (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depression) and burnout symptoms, while improving compassion, empathy, mindfulness, resilience, psychological well-being, and emotion-regulation strategies after the intervention. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these improvements will be maintained at a two-month follow-up. METHODS: Medical students were randomly assigned to an 8-week CCT or a Waitlist control group (WL). They completed self-report assessments at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and a 2-month follow-up. The outcomes measured were compassion, empathy, mindfulness, well-being, resilience, emotional regulation, psychological distress, burnout, and COVID-19 concern. Mixed-effects models and Reliable Change Index were computed. RESULTS: Compared with WL, CCT showed significant improvements in self-compassion, mindfulness, and emotion regulation, as well as a significant decrease in stress, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion component of burnout. Furthermore, some of these effects persisted at follow-up. No adverse effects of meditation practices were found. CONCLUSIONS: CCT enhanced compassion skills while reducing psychological distress in medical students, this being critical to preserving the mental health of physicians while promoting compassionate care for patients. The need for institutions to include this type of training is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is accumulating evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions in alleviating depressive symptoms. A crucial question is, however, whether mindfulness interventions are more effective for some individuals than others, depending on individual characteristics before a mindfulness intervention. We exploratorily investigated whether the effectiveness of school-based mindfulness intervention against depressive symptoms is modified by executive functions, rumination, and emotion regulation among adolescents. METHODS: The longitudinal data included adolescents with at least mild depressive symptoms at the baseline (n = 369, at the 6th-8th grade, 68.4% female) who were randomized into a 9-week school-based mindfulness intervention group, into an active control group receiving relaxation program, or into an inactive control group. Adolescents' executive functions, rumination, and emotion regulation (i.e., acceptance, catastrophizing, and positive reappraisal) were assessed at the baseline; and depressive symptoms at three time points (at the baseline and at 9-week and 6-month follow-ups). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with at least mild depressive symptoms at the baseline, high catastrophizing, high acceptance, and low executive functions were found to increase the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention against depressive symptoms. There seemed to be some sex differences. Thus, when aiming to alleviate depressive symptoms, mindfulness-based intervention may possibly be more effective for adolescents with high catastrophizing, high acceptance, and low executive functioning (than for adolescents with the opposite dispositions). However, as this study was exploratory by nature and corrections for multiple testing were not used, the findings must be regarded as preliminary and need confirmation in further studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with psoriasis can experience psychological distress that might be amenable to psychosocial self-help. OBJECTIVES: This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of two theoretically developed self-help interventions designed to reduce feelings of shame and improve quality of life. METHODS: A randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted comprising 130 participants with psoriasis who were randomly allocated to receive either compassion-based self-help (n = 65) or mindfulness-based self-help (n = 65), over a 4-week period. Both interventions were provided online. RESULTS: The interventions were found to be acceptable, with over 70% of study completers reporting that they found the materials helpful. Of the 130 participants, 92 completed the study, with attrition at 29%. Both interventions showed modest yet statistically significant reductions in shame (Cohen's d = 0.20) and improvements in quality of life (Cohen's d = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Self-help based on compassion and mindfulness is acceptable to users, and can reduce feelings of shame and improve quality of life for people living with psoriasis. What is already known about this topic? Psoriasis can be associated with psychological distress. Various forms of psychological intervention have been tested; however, few compassion based interventions have been developed or trialled. What does this study add? This study demonstrates that compassion-based self-help is acceptable to people with psoriasis. This study provides provisional evidence of effectiveness of compassion based self-help in reducing feelings of shame and improving quality of life for people living with psoriasis.",

        "title": "Web-Based Self-Compassion Training to Improve the Well-Being of Youth With Chronic Medical Conditions: Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of young people live with chronic physical conditions (eg, diabetes, asthma, and autoimmune disease) that frequently involve recurrent pain, fatigue, activity limitations, stigma, and isolation. These issues may be exacerbated as young people transition through adolescence. Accordingly, young people with chronic illness are at a high risk of psychological distress. Accessible, evidence-based interventions for young people with chronic illnesses are urgently needed to improve well-being, support adaptation, and enhance daily functioning. Self-compassion, which is an adaptive means of relating to oneself during times of difficulty, is a promising intervention target for this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the efficacy of a 4-week, self-guided, web-based self-compassion training program for improving well-being among young Australians (aged 16-25 years) living with a chronic medical condition. The primary outcomes were self-compassion, emotion regulation difficulties, and coping; the secondary outcomes were well-being, distress, and quality of life. We also sought to test whether changes in primary outcomes mediated changes in secondary outcomes and gather feedback about the strengths and limitations of the program. METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week, fully automated, web-based self-compassion training program with a waitlist control. Participants were recruited via the internet, and outcomes were self-assessed at 4 (T1) and 12 weeks (T2) after the baseline time point via a web-based survey. A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the program feedback. RESULTS: Overall, 151 patients (age: mean 21.15, SD 2.77 years; female patients: n=132, 87.4%) were randomized to the intervention (n=76, 50.3%) and control (n=75, 49.7%) groups. The loss-to-follow-up rate was 47.4%, and program use statistics indicated that only 29% (22/76) of young people in the experimental group completed 100% of the program. The main reported barrier to completion was a lack of time. As anticipated, treatment effects were observed for self-compassion (P=.01; partial \u03b7(2)=0.05; small effect); well-being (P<=.001; partial \u03b7(2)=0.07; medium effect); and distress (P=.003; partial \u03b7(2)=0.054; small-medium effect) at the posttest time point and maintained at follow-up. Contrary to our hypotheses, no intervention effects were observed for emotion regulation difficulties or maladaptive coping strategies. Improvements in adaptive coping were observed at the posttest time point but were not maintained at follow-up. Self-compassion, but not emotion regulation difficulties or coping, mediated the improvements in well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal-contact, web-based self-compassion training can confer mental health benefits on young people with chronic conditions. This group experiences substantial challenges to participation in mental health supports, and program engagement and retention in this trial were suboptimal. Future work should focus on refining the program content, engagement, and delivery to optimize engagement and treatment outcomes for the target group.

This study analyzed the effectiveness of self-compassion training on hopelessness and resilience in the parents of children with cancer. METHODS: this was an experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design and a control group. The statistical population included all parents of children with cancer hospitalized in Amir Kabir Hospital of Arak in 2020. The research sample consisted of 30 parents of children with cancer selected through convenience sampling. The participants were equally divided into experimental (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups at random. The research instruments were the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The experimental group underwent eight 90 min sessions of self-compassion training on a weekly basis. Finally, the multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was employed for data analysis. RESULTS: the mean (\u00b1SD) of the post-test scores of hopelessness and resilience were reported 10.20 (\u00b14.95) and 43.33 (\u00b14.27), respectively, in the experimental group, whereas they were reported 13.78 (\u00b14.94) and 38.73 (\u00b14.07), respectively, in the control group. According to the results, self-compassion training had significant effects on the resilience and hopelessness of the parents of children with cancer (p < 0.01). Self-compassion training had a positive, significant effect on their resilience. It was also efficient in decreasing their hopelessness.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may have a positive effect on pregnancy distress but randomized controlled trials with sufficient power are lacking. The current study examined the effectiveness of an online self-guided MBI in pregnant women with pregnancy distress. METHODS: Pregnant women with elevated pregnancy distress levels at 12 weeks of pregnancy, measured with the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale negative affect (TPDS-NA), were randomized into an intervention group (online MBI, N = 109) or control group (care as usual, N = 110). The primary outcome was the change in pregnancy distress post-intervention and at eight-weeks-follow-up. Secondary outcomes were mindfulness skills (Three Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form), rumination (Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire), and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form) at post-intervention and follow-up in the intervention group. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found in pregnancy distress scores, but no significant differences between intervention and control group appeared. The MBI group showed improvements in mindfulness skills, rumination, and self-compassion. LIMITATIONS: Low adherence to the intervention and assessment of secondary outcome measures in the intervention group only. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention trial with one of the largest samples (N = 219) provided no evidence of a significant effect of an online self-guided MBI in distressed pregnant women. An online MBI may be associated with an improvement in mindfulness skills, rumination, and self-compassion. Future research should address the effectiveness of MBI's with different formats (online and group-based combined) and examine a possible delayed effect.

        "abstract": "The present study used a latent growth curve modeling approach to (a) examine the effectiveness of a brief self-compassion intervention on reducing impostor phenomenon, maladaptive perfectionism, and psychological distress and (b) explore who would benefit more from this intervention. A total of 227 college students at a large Midwest university were randomly assigned to participate in either a 4-week brief self-compassion intervention group or a nonintervention control group. Analyses of the effectiveness of the intervention suggested the brief self-compassion intervention had significant treatment effects for reducing impostor phenomenon and maladaptive perfectionism. Moreover, this study also examined whether participants with different levels of fear of self-compassion and core self-evaluation would report different levels of treatment effectiveness. Fear of self-compassion was found to be a significant moderator of the intervention effects in reducing maladaptive perfectionism and psychological distress. Specifically, participants in the intervention group with higher levels of fear of self-compassion reported a greater decline in both maladaptive perfectionism and psychological distress over time when compared to those with lower levels of fear of self-compassion. Core self-evaluation significantly moderated the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing participants' levels of impostor phenomenon and maladaptive perfectionism. Specifically, participants in the intervention group with lower core self-evaluation reported a greater reduction in maladaptive perfectionism over time when compared to those with higher core self-evaluation.

        "title": "Cultivating concern for others: Meditation training and motivated engagement with human suffering.",
        "abstract": "Contemplative traditions have long affirmed that compassion and kindness are trainable skills. While research on meditation practice has recently flourished, the mechanisms that might engender such changes are still poorly understood. Here, we present a motivational framework to explain why meditation training should increase concern for others and modulate empathic engagement with human suffering over time. Meditation practices are conceived as tools for enacting cognitive and emotion regulatory goals that are conditioned by the underlying ethical motivation of the training-to reduce and alleviate suffering. In support of this account, we present data from a randomized, wait-list-controlled study of intensive meditation. In Study 1, we use a novel cardiovascular index to show that 3 months of meditation training can increase the motivational salience of others' suffering, as compared to the salience of threats to oneself. In Study 2, we demonstrate that training-related changes in the ability to orient attention to suffering are mediated by the dynamic regulation of distress-related physiological arousal. Finally, in Study 3, we provide exploratory evidence suggesting that meditation training may influence how human suffering is encoded in memory, leaving lasting imprints on the recollection of emotional experience. Together, our findings suggest that meditation training can strengthen the motivational relevance of others' suffering, prompting a shift from self-focused to other-focused evaluative processing. Considering meditation training from a motivational standpoint offers an important perspective for understanding how compassion can be cultivated through intentional practice.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effective smoking cessation programmes are essential for assisting smokers in quitting, indirectly lowering mortality and morbidity associated with smoking. Numerous studies have indicated positive outcomes when using mindfulness treatment (MT) to treat psychological or behavioural health issues. Although to date, no study has looked at the effectiveness of online MT for quitting smoking while addressing mental health, particularly among the Asian population. Therefore, this study compares the efficiency of online MT to traditional counselling therapy (CT) in aiding smoking cessation programmes while also addressing mental health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomised control study with a two-group, single-blind design and baseline evaluation was selected. Social media sites were used to advertise for participants, who were then admitted after meeting the requirements. Participants who met the eligibility requirements were randomly split into two groups. Each group received a total of three sessions of online therapy (MT or CT), once every two weeks, as well as one phone call per week as reinforcement. At the beginning and end of the intervention, participants completed questionnaires (1st week and 5th week). Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) statistical analysis was used to analyse all the variables. RESULTS: The MT group experienced a statistically significant decrease in cigarette consumption (beta: -3.50, 95% Wald CI: - 4.62, -2.39) compared to the CT group over time. Furthermore, the MT group demonstrated significant improvements in their scores for the AAQ-2, anxiety, stress, depression and mindfulness compared to the CT group. CONCLUSION: Online MT is more successful at assisting smokers in lowering their daily cigarette intake and supporting their mental health during the smoking cessation process. Further longitudinal comparisons of the effectiveness of online MT should be undertaken using online platforms in future studies.",

Extensive mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to have positive effects in patients with psoriasis. However, it is unclear whether brief (2-week) interventions are also beneficial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 2-week mindfulness-based intervention in patients with psoriasis. Patients were randomly assigned to an experimental (treatment-as-usual + mindfulness-based intervention) or control group (treatment-as-usual) during their clinic stay. All variables were measured by self-report using validated questionnaires: primary outcomes were mindfulness and self-compassion, secondary outcomes were itch catastrophizing, social anxiety, stress and skin status. Variables were assessed prior to, immediately and 3 months after the intervention. Effects were tested by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses of pre-post-measurements (n = 39) revealed a significant interaction effect on self-reported mindfulness [F(1,35) = 7.46, p = 0.010, \u03b72p = 0.18] and a tendency to a significant effect on self-reported self-compassion [F(1,36) = 3.03, p = 0.090, \u03b72p = 0.08].

Multilevel linear modelling results suggested the self-compassion training program was statistically superior at improving outcome measures relative to the waitlist control condition (ps < .05; \u03b7(2)(p)s = .12-.33), but not relative to the applied relaxation training condition (ps > .05; \u03b7(2)(p)s = .01-.05). Self-compassion training produced greater clinically significant gains in self-compassion and reductions in fear of self-compassion compared to both the waitlist condition and applied relaxation training. The current trial provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a self-help self-compassion training program and provides evidence that self-compassion training may be beneficial for managing clinically significant SAD symptoms.",

        "abstract": "This study tests a group-based secular contemplative practice intervention, Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT), with parents of young children. We report on a randomized controlled preliminary efficacy study. Certified teachers administered CBCT for 20 hr across 8 to 10 weeks in two cohorts of parents with infants and young children. The intervention group was compared to a waitlist control group. Thirty-nine parents and their children, who ranged in age from 4 months to 5 years, were evaluated at pre- and postintervention (n = 25 intervention, n = 14 waitlist control) on hair cortisol concentration. Parents also completed self-administered questionnaires at both time points regarding demographics, physical symptoms of stress, parenting stress, self-compassion, and mindfulness. Children of parents in the CBCT group experienced significant decreases in cortisol at the postintervention assessment, as compared with the control group. However, parent cortisol and self-report measures did not significantly change other than a small effect on clinical levels of parenting stress. CBCT may be a positive new way to intervene with parents to lower infants' and young children's cumulative physiological stress.",

        "abstract": "Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) is a common sexual dysfunction in women. Both mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus psychoeducation and sex therapy, education, and support (STEP; which contains the same educational information as in the MBCT arm but also integrates supportive-expressive therapy), are effective. We tested mediators and moderators of improvements. Each treatment arm consisted of eight sessions delivered weekly, and participants completed measures online pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month post-treatment. Depression, self-reported interoceptive awareness, self-compassion, self-criticism, and mindfulness were examined as mediators, and expectations for improvement as a moderator. Of 148 cisgender women who consented, 70 were randomized to the MBCT plus psychoeducation group (mean age 39.3 \u00b1 13.2 yrs) and 78 to the STEP group (mean age 37.9 \u00b1 12.2 yrs). Decreases in depression mediated decreases in sexual distress in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group only. Improvements in interoceptive awareness mediated changes in both sexual desire and arousal, and sexual distress, and to a greater degree after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in self-compassion mediated changes in sexual desire and arousal only for the MBCT plus psychoeducation group and mediated changes in sexual distress in both groups. Reductions in self-criticism mediated improvements in sexual distress to a greater extent after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in mindfulness predicted changes in desire and arousal, and distress only in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group. Expectations for improvement did not moderate any outcomes. The findings have implications for understanding common and potentially distinct pathways by which MBCT plus psychoeducation and supportive sex education improve symptoms of SIAD.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine the effects of a mindfulness group intervention on self-compassion, psychological resilience, and mental health of children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas. METHODS: A total of 64 children from single-parent families in Tibetan areas were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 32) and an intervention group (n = 32). Participants in the control group received conventional education, while participants in the intervention group received 6-week mindfulness intervention in addition to the conventional education. Both groups completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Self-compassion Scale (SCS), Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescent (RSCA), and the Mental Health Test (MHT) before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, the levels of mindfulness and self-compassion in the intervention group were significantly improved in relative to the control group. The positive cognition in the RSCA was significantly increased in the intervention group, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group. There was a trend towards lower self-blame in the MHT, but no significant impact of the intervention on the overall level of mental health was found. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a 6-week mindfulness training effectively improve self-compassion and resilience of single-parent children. Thus, mindfulness training as a cost-effective approach can be arranged in the curriculum, which helps students develop high level of self-compassion and resilience. In addition, there may be a need to improve emotional control in order to improve mental health.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of mindfulness training for primary care (MTPC), an integrated warm mindfulness training program, on emotion regulation and its relationship with health behavior change. Interventions that improve self-regulation, particularly emotion regulation, are needed for the self-management of comorbid chronic physical and mental illnesses. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may impact self-regulation and facilitate health behavior change. METHOD: A randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial was conducted in a population of adult primary care patients to evaluate the impact of MTPC versus a low-dose mindfulness comparator (LDC) on self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) total score and other assays of self-regulation at baseline, Weeks 8 and 24. Self-reported action plan initiation was reported between Weeks 8 and 10. Participants had diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or stress-related disorders. MTPC is an 8-week insurance-reimbursable warm MBI designed to cultivate mindfulness and self-compassion and to catalyze chronic illness self-management related health behavior change. RESULTS: Compared to LDC, MTPC participants had statistically significant reductions in DERS total score at 8 weeks (d = -0.59, beta = -12.98, 95% CI [-23.3 to -2.6]; p = .01) and 24 weeks (d = -0.61, beta = -13.35, [-24.3, -2.4]; p = .02). Compared to 38% for LDC, 63% of MTPC participants successfully initiated their action plan within 3 weeks (OR = 2.87, [1.1, 7.9]; p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial demonstrated MTPC enhanced emotion regulation and facilitated initiation of chronic illness self-management and health behavior change among primary care patients with anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders, replicating previous reports.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness is an established approach to reduce distress and stress reactivity by improving awareness and tolerability of thoughts and emotions. This study compares mindfulness training to sleep hygiene in persons with multiple sclerosis (PWMS) who report chronic insomnia, examining sleep efficiency (SE), self-reported sleep quality and quality of life. METHODS: Fifty-three PWMS were randomized (1:1) in a single-blinded, parallel group design to ten, two-hour weekly sessions of Mindfulness Based Stress Intervention for Insomnia (MBSI-I) over a span of ten weeks or a single, one hour sleep hygiene (SH) session over one day. The primary outcome measure was SE, measured by the FitbitTM Charge 2 wrist device, at 10 and 16 weeks from the start of study interventions. Self-report outcomes included the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Rating Scale (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI). Nineteen participants in the MBSI-I group and 24 in the SH group completed the primary study. Subsequently, ten participants in the original SH group participated in the 10-week MSBI-I course and their data was added to the MBSI-I cohort (eMSBI-I). RESULTS: While neither SE nor the PSQI showed significant differences between MBSI-I, eMBSI-I and SH groups, ISI improved in both the MSBI-I and eMBSI-I vs SH at 10 weeks (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0275) but not 16 weeks. However, pre and post assessments within the MBSI-I and eMBSI-I cohorts did show significant improvement in the PSQI and ISI at 10 and 16 weeks, while SH was significant in the ISI only at 16 weeks. Several quality of life measurements, including fatigue, mental health and cognitive function favored the mindfulness cohorts. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates beneficial effects of MBSR on insomnia, sleep quality and quality of life in PWMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03949296. 14 May 2019.",

        "title": "Efficacy of mHealth aided 12-week meditation and breath intervention on change in burnout and professional quality of life among health care providers of a tertiary care hospital in north India: a randomized waitlist-controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Burnout is \"Chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.\" Professional quality of life (PQL) includes work related experiences of compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue. Healthcare providers (HCPs) are highly susceptible to burnout and compassion fatigue due to their demanding work, which lowers PQL. Burnout leads to poor care, medical errors, and patient safety across healthcare disciplines. Yoga has been shown to improve resilience, reduce stress, and increase self-compassion and psycho-physiological coherence. This study compared HCPs in a mHealth-aided 12-week yoga-based meditation and breath intervention to waitlist controls for HCP burnout and PQL at a north Indian tertiary care hospital. METHODS: This was randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Total 98 HCPs (62 males and 36 females) with an average age of 28.26 \u00b1 3.547 years were enrolled consecutively from March 2021 to November 2022. Randomization was done with opaque sealed envelopes numbered in a computer-generated sequence. The experimental group (n = 49) received 12 online weekly yoga sessions and performed daily home practice (6 days a week). The waitlisted control group (n = 49) continued their daily routine. Maslach's burnout inventory (MBI), professional quality of life (PQL) and anthropometric measurements were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, the MBI outcomes of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment showed a highly significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.001). PQL outcomes of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary trauma also differed significantly (p < 0.001). Within group analysis showed that MBI and PQL outcomes improved significantly (p < 0.001) for the experimental group after 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: The current study contributes to the existing evidence on the effectiveness of Yoga in managing stress and developing resilience among doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. Integrating yoga into healthcare settings is crucial for addressing the detrimental impact of burnout on decision-making and promoting positive patient outcomes. mHealth technologies have the potential to enhance the user-friendliness of yoga-based interventions by personalizing the practice space and time. Yoga-based interventions and mHealth technologies can effectively address physician burnout, in a simple and implementable manner.",

Heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were monitored throughout the study. Multilevel modeling indicated that self-compassion induction had no significant effect on cortisol recovery. An exploratory analysis examining the moderating effect of trait self-compassion indicated that the effect of self-compassion induction was prominent when trait self-compassion was low but not when it was high. These findings suggest that self-compassion induction may help recovery from stressful experiences, particularly for those who are less self-compassionate.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress and mental disorders in pregnancy can adversely affect the developing fetus. Women with a preconception history of mental disorders or of psychosocial vulnerabilities are at increased risk of experiencing perinatal stress or mental health problems. Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) is an acceptable intervention for pregnant women and has a growing evidence-base with meta-analyses consistently pointing to reductions in symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. This study protocol aim to address the need for a wider array of evidence-based and non-pharmacological options during pregnancy to reduce stress and improve mental health in a psychosocially highly vulnerable group of women. METHODS: Pregnant women with a preconception history of mental disorders or psychosocial vulnerabilities (n = 240) will be recruited from an obstetric ambulatory clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark. Recruitment for the study began in March 2022 and will continue until the desired number of participants is reached. Consenting pregnant women will be randomized to one of two study arms, an adapted MBSR program as add on to usual care or usual care alone. The primary outcome is mental wellbeing at nine months post-randomization. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include stress, anxiety, depression, and maternal antenatal attachment, experience of childbirth, delivery and mode of delivery. Mindfulness and self-compassion are examined as possible mediators of the effect on outcomes. DISCUSSION: Teaching the skills of mindfulness meditation to a psychosocially vulnerable group of pregnant women could prove a viable and non-pharmacological approach to improve mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy, reduce stress and support the transition to parenthood. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction does not target a particular group, and results from the study is thus of potential relevance for pregnant women in general as a means of reducing stress and improving perinatal mental health and wellbeing.

The training increased wellbeing and all self-transcendent emotions regardless of interindividual variance in the changes across time. Changes in all self-transcendent emotions were positively associated with changes in wellbeing. The strength of those associations was comparable in the waiting-list group and the training group. More studies are needed to test whether the effects of mindfulness practice on wellbeing are driven by increases in self-transcendent emotions. The study was conducted over 6 weeks during the COVID19 pandemic.

Family caregivers, as a vulnerable marginalized population and invisible backbone of the health care system, need accessible and effective interventions that are tailored to their particular needs. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a live online mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (tele-MBCT) intervention for family caregivers of individuals with dementia. METHODS: Family caregivers were assigned to a tele-MBCT intervention or a usual care control group. Tele-MBCT participants attended eight weekly live online training and practiced mindfulness practices at home. All participants completed surveys at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: 26 participants (age 60\u00b113 years) were enrolled and randomized (14 in the intervention and 12 in the control group), and 92.3% completed the study. 88% of the participants were female, and 70% were caring for a parent for a mean of 5.12\u00b12.88 years. 84% of the participants in the intervention group attended at least seven sessions and the average of daily practice was 23.58\u00b145.71 minutes. All participants were satisfied with the intervention, and 88.8% were satisfied with the online delivery method.

METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of the FOREST-A-an Internet-based stress recovery intervention for adolescents-will be conducted. The FOREST-A is an adapted version of stress recovery intervention initially developed for healthcare workers. FOREST-A is a third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based Internet-delivered 4-week psychosocial intervention, which comprises six modules: Introduction, Relaxation, Psychological detachment, Mastery, Control, and Summary. The intervention will be evaluated using the two-arm RCT with intervention and care as usual (CAU) condition at pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up. The measured outcomes will be stress recovery, adjustment disorder, generalized anxiety and depression symptoms, psychological well-being, and perceived positive social support.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this qualitative study was to delineate psychological mechanisms of change in the first randomized controlled trial of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD). Theories regarding psychological processes involved in psychedelic therapy remain underdeveloped. METHOD: Participants (N = 13) mostly identified as non-Hispanic and White, with approximately equal proportions of cisgender men and women. Participants engaged in semistructured interviews about their subjective experiences in the study. Questions probed the nature of participants' drinking before and after the study as well as coping patterns in response to strong emotions, stress, and cravings for alcohol. Verbatim transcripts were coded using Dedoose software, and content was analyzed with interpretive phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported that the psilocybin treatment helped them process emotions related to painful past events and helped promote states of self-compassion, self-awareness, and feelings of interconnectedness. The acute states during the psilocybin sessions were described as laying the foundation for developing more self-compassionate regulation of negative affect. Participants also described newfound feelings of belonging and an improved quality of relationships following the treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results support the assertion that psilocybin increases the malleability of self-related processing, and diminishes shame-based and self-critical thought patterns while improving affect regulation and reducing alcohol cravings. These findings suggest that psychosocial treatments that integrate self-compassion training with psychedelic therapy may serve as a useful tool for enhancing psychological outcomes in the treatment of AUD.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an association was observed between medical students' stress, possibly because of an intensive academic workload and clinical responsibilities, and mental ill health. The literature has shown the benefit of online mindfulness interventions for different mental health challenges. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on their benefit to medical students in South Africa. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore whether medical students attending an online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) would show improved resilience and stress management compared with attendance at an online supportive counselling (SC) programme. Secondary to this was the viability of the intervention, for which an in-depth understanding of participants' experiences was sought. SETTING: The study setting was online through https://zoom.us/. METHODS: Forty-five participants were randomly allocated between two 6-week, teacher-facilitated groups. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) of outcome, well-being, perceived stress and self-compassion scores conducted at three time points, as well as thematic analysis of participant feedback, contributed to quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: Participants in both the groups showed significant improvement over time in measures of well-being, perceived stress and subjective stress management. Participants in the mindfulness group showed a statistically significant treatment effect in mindfulness at programme completion. A decrease in self-compassion over time was observed in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that in this South African medical student cohort, an online MBI and a SC programme are both feasible and show potential for reducing stress, increasing stress management and increasing resilience.

        "abstract": "The current study was designed to extend previous research by testing whether self-compassion acts as a protective factor that facilitates faster affective and physiological recovery from stress in people with elevated depressive symptoms. Specifically, we examined the effect of experimentally induced self-compassion on positive affect, negative affect, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) recovery from stress. Participants (N = 59) experiencing elevated depressive symptoms completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized psychosocial stressor, and then were randomly assigned to either a self-compassion induction or a no-strategy control induction before resting quietly during the 30-min recovery period. During the induction period, participants in the self-compassion condition exhibited a greater increase in positive affect and a trend towards a greater decrease in negative affect than did participants in the no-strategy control condition. However, the psychological benefits of self-compassion did not continue during the post-induction recovery period. Moreover, changes in RSA levels did not differ between participants in the self-compassion and no-strategy control condition. These results suggest that, among individuals with elevated depressive symptoms, brief self-compassion inductions have short-term beneficial psychological, but not physiological, effects. As such, our findings delineate the benefits and boundaries of single-session self-compassion inductions in depression, and in doing so, inform future experimental and applied research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness and meditation have a rich historical tradition, and a growing scientific base of evidence supports their use in creating positive psychological and neuroplastic changes for practitioners. Although meditation can be taught in various ways, the scientific community has yet to systematically study the impact of different types of meditation on neuropsychological outcomes, especially as it pertains to digital implementation. Therefore, it is critical that the instruction of mindfulness be evidence based because meditation is being used in both scientific and clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the use of teacher cueing and the integration of neuroscience education into a meditation program. Compassion cueing was chosen as the element of experimental manipulation because traditional lineages of Buddhist meditation teach compassion for self and others as one of the primary outcomes of meditation. We hypothesized that participants receiving compassion cueing would have enhanced neuropsychological outcomes compared with those receiving functional cueing and that gains in neuroscience knowledge would relate to positive neuropsychological outcomes. METHODS: Participants (n=89) were randomized to receive either functional cueing (control group) or compassion cueing (experimental group) and engaged with five 10-minute meditation sessions a week for 4 weeks. All intervention sessions were administered through digital presentation. All participants completed ecological momentary assessments before and after the daily intervention, as well as pre- and postintervention questionnaires. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated significant benefits over time, including increased mindfulness and self-compassion, decreased depression, and gains in neuroscience content (all P<.001); however, no significant between-group differences were found. Daily scores from each day of the intervention showed a statistically significant shift from active toward settled. Importantly, long-term increases in mindfulness were positively correlated to changes in compassion (r=0.326; P=.009) and self-compassion (r=0.424; P<.001) and negatively correlated to changes in anxiety (r=-0.266; P=.03) and depression (r=-0.271; P=.03). Finally, the acute effects of meditation were significantly correlated to the longitudinal outcomes (with a small-to-medium effect size), especially those relevant to mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel neuroscience-based education-meditation program that enhanced self-regulation as evidenced by improved mindfulness, self-compassion, and mood state. Our findings demonstrate the behavioral importance of engaging with mindfulness meditation and reinforce the idea that the benefits of meditation are independent of teacher cueing behavior. Future studies will need to investigate the brain-based changes underlying these meditation-induced outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study investigates possible predictors of treatment response in an Internet-delivered Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (iMBCT) intervention with therapist support. This iMBCT program, a fully online delivered intervention with asynchronous therapist support, has previously been shown to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in women treated for breast cancer and men treated for prostate cancer. METHODS: Eighty-two breast- and prostate cancer survivors experiencing psychological distress received 8 weeks of therapist-guided iMBCT. Primary outcomes were improvement in anxiety and depression scores from baseline to post-treatment and from baseline to six-months follow-up. Clinical predictors included levels of depression and anxiety at the time of screening and at baseline, as well as time since diagnosis. Demographic predictors included age and educational level. Therapy-related predictors included working alliance, self-compassion, and five facets of mindfulness. Mixed Linear Models were employed to test the prediction effects over time. RESULTS: Higher levels of baseline depression were associated with increased treatment response in anxiety at post-treatment, and lower levels of self-compassion were associated with increased treatment response in depression at post-treatment. None of the proposed predictors significantly predicted treatment response at six-months follow-up. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that iMBCT can be provided for cancer survivors regardless of their age, educational level, and time since diagnosis (up to five years) and that therapeutic alliance is not crucial for treatment response. We did not identify characteristics predicting treatment response, although many factors were tested. Still, other characteristics may be predictors, and given the relatively small sample size and a large number of statistical tests, the results should be interpreted with caution.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with acromegaly have often several comorbidities, including decreased quality of life, mood alterations and chronic pain. Mindfulness is effective at improving mood, quality of life and pain management; however, there is no data available on its effect in patients with acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at evaluating changes in quality of life, mood, pain, sleep, self-compassion, life satisfaction, blood pressure and heart rate after a mindfulness program. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This was a randomized, multicentre, international clinical trial (Barcelona-BCN and Bergamo-BG) of 60 patients, 30 per centre. MEASUREMENTS: The intervention group participated in an 8-week face-to-face group program; the control group followed normal clinical routine. In BG, patients performed a classic Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program; in BCN they performed an adapted program including elements of mindfulness and compassion with a greater focus on daily life. RESULTS: In the BCN intervention group there was an increase in night-time hours in bed (p = 0.05) after the program. In both centres there was a trend to a reduction of the time to start sleeping (p = 0.06 BCN, p = 0.07 BG). In BCN, the intervention group reduced the pain score compared to the control group (p = .02), and an improvement in self-compassion was found (p = .04). In both centres, heart rate decreased significantly in the intervention group during a single 2-hour session. This was evidenced at the first and the last program session (BCN p = .013 and p = .009; BG < 0.001 and p = .04). A training effect was found in BG, where heart rate fell more in the last session than in the first (p = 002). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated for the first time the value of a mindfulness program in patients with acromegaly, analysing possible effects and advantages, and clarifying the usefulness of a specific protocol for the disease.",

        "abstract": "Major depression is one of the most common mental health problems worldwide. More than one-third of patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In this study, we explored the feasibility of group compassion-focused therapy (CFT) for TRD using a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. Eighteen participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group (CFT and usual care) and control group (usual care alone) and a participant in each group withdrew. Participants in the intervention group received a 1.5-h session every week for 12 weeks. The effects of the intervention on the participants' scores were calculated using a linear mixed model. There was a larger reduction in their depressive symptoms and fears of compassion for self and a greater increase in their compassion for self compared to the control group participants. The reliable clinical indices showed that in the CFT (intervention) group, three of nine participants recovered (33%), two improved (22%), two recovered but non-reliably (22%), and the condition of two remained unchanged (22%). These findings indicate adequate feasibility of group CFT for TRD in Japanese clinical settings. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/], identifier [UMIN 000028698].",

        "title": "Mindfulness and bodily distress.",
        "abstract": "We have created a mindfulness approach to treat patients who experience multiple, persistent, and disabling physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a well-defined medical or surgical condition. Randomized controlled trials in this area are few, and research is hampered by the lack of clear definitions. Bodily distress syndrome (BDS) or bodily stress is an empirically defined definition unifying various conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and somatization disorder. In the present PhD, we explored whether patients suffering from BDS may be committed to mental training in the form of mindfulness therapy, which is a mindfulness program specifically targeted patients suffering from BDS. The theoretical model for including mindfulness training in the treatment of BDS is based on identified neurobiological impairments in these patients and the neurobiological improvements that mindfulness training may offer. BDS is a major public health issue possibly associated with the pathology of the immuno-endocrine and autonomic nervous system. BDS patients are often stigmatized, and effective treatment is rarely delivered, which leaves these patients isolated, left by themselves, vulnerable to potentially harming medical and/or alternative treatments. Accordingly, there is a need for non-harming practical tools that patients can learn to master so that they can improve the ability to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a group program that employs mindfulness practice to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic, and psychiatric disorders. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is designed to prevent depressive relapse. Paper I and II present systematic literature reviews only of randomized controlled trials on MBSR and MBCT. The effect of MBSR has been explored on fibromyalgia in three studies, none of them showed convincing results, but gave some indications as to improvement. The reviews recommended MBSR as a useful method for improving mental health; however, lack of long-term follow-up and active control groups are limitations in most studies. MBCT was recommended as a tool for preventing depressive relapse in recovered, recurrently depressed patients, but the implication of MBSR and MBCT is problematic, especially due to the lack of well educated mindfulness teachers. We combined MBSR with cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, specifically targeted BDS. Paper III provides original data from 119 patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial, mindfulness therapy for BDS. The randomized controlled trial indicates that BDS patients are capable of and willing to engage in mindfulness therapy. This thesis showed that mindfulness therapy can safely and successfully engage BDS patients in mindfulness practice. Since individual CBT and psychiatric consultation have previously been found to have positive outcomes for BDS patients, we compared mindfulness therapy to an active control group entitled specialized treatment in which an individual treatment was planned in collaboration between the patient and an MD specialized in BDS, CBT, and psychiatry. Mindfulness therapy was comparable to specialized treatment in improving the quality of life and the symptoms of the patients with BDS at 15-month follow-up. For primary outcome physical health (PCS) at 15-month follow-up, different developments over time for the two treatment groups could not be established (F(3,2674) = 1.51, p = 0.21). However, in the mindfulness therapy group, PCS significant changed at the end of treatment and this change remained at 15-month follow-up, whereas no significantly change was seen in the specialized treatment group until at the 15-month follow-up. In the mindfulness therapy group, 26%; CI: 14-38 reported a marked improvement (> 1 SD) at the end of treatment compared with 10%; CI: 2-18 in the specialized treatment group. This amounts to a statistically significant difference between the groups (OR = 3.21; CI 1.05-9.78, p = 0.04). The results are indicating that mindfulness therapy produced greater and more rapid improvements than specialized treatment. Mindfulness therapy appears to produce improvements within the range of those reported in the STreSS-1 trial, where CBT was compared with enhanced usual care, and no improvements on the SF-36 scale were observed in the enhanced usual care group. This indicates that the changes accomplished with the two treatments mindfulness therapy and specialized treatment reflect real changes attributable to the interventions. The economic effects of mindfulness therapy are evaluated in paper IV by the use of original register data from the 119 enrolled patients and a matched control group of 5,950 individuals. Mindfulness therapy had substantial socioeconomic benefits over specialized treatment. The costs incurred to cover permanent health-related benefits, especially disability pension, were significantly lower in the mindfulness therapy group than in the specialized treatment group over a 15-month follow-up period; 25% from the mindfulness therapy group received disability pension compared with 45% from the specialized treatment group (p = 0.025). The total health care utilization was reduced over time in both groups from the year before inclusion (mean $ 5,325, median $ 2,971) to the year after inclusion (mean $ 3,644, median $ 1,593) (p = 0.0001). There was no difference between the two groups. Five and ten years before their inclusion, the BDS patients were less self-supporting than an age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched population control group; the BDS patients accumulated more weeks of sickness benefit and unemployment. Thus, the included BDS patients may have been ill and in high risk for a social decline five and ten years before they received a proper diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, the social and economic consequences of BDS are significant and mindfulness therapy may have a potential to significantly improve function, quality of life and symptoms, prevent a social decline, and reduce societal costs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a 10-min self-compassion writing in alleviating body dissatisfaction, self-objectification, and emotional eating in young adult women engaged in emotional eating in the context of appearance-related cyberbullying. METHOD: A total of 175 Chinese young adult women (M(age)  = 20.90, SD = 1.65) were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: self-compassion, distraction, or control group. At baseline, participants completed assessments of trait and state body dissatisfaction, trait self-objectification, trait self-compassion, emotional eating, and positive and negative affect. Then they needed to recall an appearance-related cyberbullying victimization experience, after which state body dissatisfaction, state self-objectification, and positive and negative affect were measured. After the intervention, participants completed measures of state body dissatisfaction, state self-objectification, positive and negative affect, state self-compassion, and a food-choosing task. At 1-month follow-up, participants completed measures of trait body dissatisfaction, trait self-objectification, trait self-compassion, and emotional eating. RESULTS: At post-intervention, state body dissatisfaction and negative affect were significantly lower, and positive affect was significantly higher in both the self-compassion and distraction groups compared to control. State self-objectification was significantly lower in the self-compassion group than in the other two groups. At 1-month follow-up, the self-compassion group showed significantly lower levels of body dissatisfaction than the control group. DISCUSSION: The findings provide initial evidence for the potential of self-compassion writing in reducing state self-objectification and state body dissatisfaction in the context of appearance-related cyberbullying. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Appearance-related cyberbullying, a common phenomenon in social networking sites, has been documented to associate with appearance-related concerns and disordered eating in young adult women. However, effective interventions that can reduce these negative associations are scarce. This study preliminarily found that a brief self-compassion writing could be a potential intervention for reducing state self-objectification and state body dissatisfaction in young adult women who had suffered appearance-related cyberbullying.",

        "title": "Boosting Empathy and Compassion Through Mindfulness-Based and Socioemotional Dyadic Practice: Randomized Controlled Trial With App-Delivered Trainings.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contemplative trainings have been found to effectively improve social skills such as empathy and compassion. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of app-delivered mindfulness-based and dyadic practices in boosting socioaffective capacity. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to compare a novel app-delivered, partner-based socioemotional intervention (Affect Dyad) with mindfulness-based training to foster empathy and compassion for the self or others. The second aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these effects. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included socioemotional and mindfulness-based interventions and a waitlist control group, which received socioemotional training after the postintervention assessment. We used linear mixed-effects models to test intervention effects on self-report measures and an ecologically valid computer task of empathy, compassion for the self and others, and theory of mind. Moderated mediation models were used to investigate whether changes in acceptance, empathic distress, empathic listening, interoceptive awareness, and mindfulness served as underlying psychological processes of intervention effects. RESULTS: In 218 participants (mean age 44.12, SD 11.71 years; 160/218, 73.4% female), we found all interventions to have positive effects on composite scores for compassion toward the self (beta(socioemotional)=.44, P<.001; beta(waitlist socioemotional)=.30, P=.002; beta(mindfulness-based)=.35, P<.001) and others (beta(socioemotional)=.24, P=.003; beta(waitlist socioemotional)=.35, P<.001; beta(mindfulness-based)=.29, P<.001). Compassion measured with the computer task did not change significantly but showed a trend toward increase only in socioemotional dyadic practice (beta(socioemotional)=.08, P=.08; beta(waitlist socioemotional)=.11, P=.06). Similarly, on the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, a nonsignificant trend toward increase was found in the socioemotional intervention group (beta(socioemotional)=.17; P=.08). Empathy significantly increased in both socioemotional groups (beta(socioemotional)=.16, P=.03; beta(waitlist socioemotional)=.35, P<.001) and the mindfulness-based group (beta(mindfulness-based)=.15; P=.04). The measures of theory of mind did not change over time. In the mindfulness-based group, the increase in self-compassion was mediated by a decrease in empathic distress (indirect effect ab(mindfulness-based)=0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.14). In the socioemotional group, an increase in self-compassion could be predicted by an increase in acceptance (beta(socioemotional)=6.63, 95% CI 0.52-12.38). CONCLUSIONS: Using a multimethod approach, this study shows that app-delivered socioemotional and mindfulness-based trainings are effective in fostering compassion for the self and others in self-report. Both low-dose trainings could boost behavioral empathy markers; however, the effects on behavioral and dispositional markers of compassion only trended after dyadic practice, yet these effects did not reach statistical significance. Training-related increases in self-compassion rely on differential psychological processes, that is, on improved empathic distress regulation through mindfulness-based training and the activation of a human care- and acceptance-based system through socioemotional dyadic training.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medical students experience a high burden of stress and suffer elevated rates of depression, burnout, and suicide compared to the general population, yet there is no consensus on how to address student wellness. PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an abridged mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention can improve measures of wellness in a randomized sample of 1st-year medical students. METHODS: Fifty-eight participants were randomized to control or 8-week MBSR intervention and then invited to participate in the study. All participants were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Resilience Scale (RS), and Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) at 3 separate time points: baseline, at the conclusion of the study intervention (8 weeks), and at 6 months after the conclusion of the intervention. The intervention consisted of 75 minutes of weekly class time, suggested meditation at home, and a half-day retreat in the last week. RESULTS: The intervention group achieved significant increase on SCS scores both at the conclusion of the study (0.58, p=.002), 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.23, 0.92], and at 6 months (0.56, p=.001), 95% CI [0.25, 0.87].

The study did not demonstrate a difference in RS after the intervention, though RS was significantly correlated with both SCS and PSS. CONCLUSIONS: An abridged MBSR intervention improves perceived stress and self-compassion in 1st-year medical students and may be a valuable curricular tool to enhance wellness and professional development.",

        "title": "COPAHS Study: protocol of a randomised experimental study comparing the effects of hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, and spiritual practices on experimental pain in healthy adults.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing interest in studying the potential benefits of so-called complementary and alternative approaches for pain management, such as hypnosis and mindfulness-based interventions. More recently, researchers have been interested in studying the effects of spiritual practices on pain experience as well. These practices may increase pain tolerance, result in a positive re-appraisal of pain and influence other psychological variables that are known to be associated with pain experience. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the immediate effects of self-hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, and a spiritual intervention relative to a control condition for increasing pain tolerance and reducing pain intensity and pain-related stress, in response to experimental painful stimulation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Recruitment is anticipated to start in November 2020. This is a randomised quantitative experimental mixed-design repeated-measures study with three assessment points: baseline (T0), pre-test (T1) and post-test (T2). Eligible healthy adults will be randomised to one of the four study conditions. Interventions will be a 20-minute audio-guided practice of either self-hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, or Christian prayer. Participants in the control group will not be instructed to use any specific strategy during the painful stimulation. Participants will be submitted to a first cycle of Cold Pressor Arm Wrap. They will then listen to a 20-minute audio recording inducing one of the three interventions, or, in the case of the control group, to a 20-minute audio recording of text from a natural history textbook. Primary outcomes are pain intensity and pain tolerance. Pain-related stress as measured by salivary cortisol level and heart rate variability are secondary outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by ISPA-University Institute's internal Ethics Committee for Research on 3rd December 2018 (reference I/010/12/2018).

        "abstract": "Chronic alcohol misuse can result in chronically elevated interleukin (IL)-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in the bloodstream. Given that Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) has been shown to reduce alcohol misuse, MBRP might also be effective in reducing IL-6 concentrations. Past research has found, however, that IL-6 does not respond consistently to mindfulness-based interventions. Building on prior studies, we examined whether between-person variability in engagement with mindfulness training (i.e., formal mindfulness practice time) is associated with between-person variability in changes in serum IL-6, using data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating MBRP for Alcohol Dependence (MBRP-A). Participants were 72 alcohol dependent adults (mean age = 43.4 years, 63.9% male, 93.1% White) who received a minimum dose (i.e., at least four sessions) of MBRP-A either at the start of the trial (n = 46) or after a 26-week delay (n = 26). IL-6 concentrations did not significantly change from pre- to post-intervention for the full sample. Nevertheless, greater mindfulness practice time was significantly associated with reduced IL-6 levels (r = -0.27). The association between practice time and IL-6 changes remained significant when controlling for intervention timing (i.e., immediate or after the 26-week delay), demographic characteristics, and changes in mindful awareness, obsessive-compulsive drinking, and depressive symptoms. The association between practice time and IL-6 changes was not significant when omitting the minimum treatment dose requirement. Overall, results suggest that the level of engagement in mindfulness training may predict changes in the inflammatory pathophysiology in adults with alcohol dependence.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Successful treatment of opioid misuse among people with chronic pain has proven elusive. Guidelines recommend nonopioid therapies, but the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions for opioid misuse is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) for the reduction of opioid misuse and chronic pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This interviewer-blinded randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from primary care clinics in Utah between January 4, 2016, and January 16, 2020. The study included 250 adults with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy who were misusing opioid medications. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with MORE (comprising training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring positive experiences) or supportive group psychotherapy (control condition) across 8 weekly 2-hour group sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were (1) opioid misuse assessed by the Drug Misuse Index (self-report, interview, and urine screen) and (2) pain severity and pain-related functional interference, assessed by subscale scores on the Brief Pain Inventory through 9 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were opioid dose, emotional distress, and ecological momentary assessments of opioid craving. The minimum intervention dose was defined as 4 or more completed sessions of MORE or supportive group psychotherapy. RESULTS: Among 250 participants (159 women [63.6%]; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [11.9] years), 129 were randomized to the MORE group and 121 to the supportive psychotherapy group. Overall, 17 participants (6.8%) were Hispanic or Latino, 218 (87.2%) were White, and 15 (6.0%) were of other races and/or ethnicities (2 American Indian, 3 Asian, 1 Black, 2 Pacific Islander, and 7 did not specify). At baseline, the mean duration of pain was 14.7 years (range, 1-60 years), and the mean (SD) morphine-equivalent opioid dose was 101.0 (266.3) mg (IQR, 16.0-90.0 mg). A total of 203 participants (81.2%) received the minimum intervention dose (mean [SD], 5.7 [2.2] sessions); at 9 months, 92 of 250 participants (36.8%) discontinued the study. The overall odds ratio for reduction in opioid misuse through the 9-month follow-up period in the MORE group compared with the supportive psychotherapy group was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.17-3.61; P = .01). At 9 months, 36 of 80 participants (45.0%) in the MORE group were no longer misusing opioids compared with 19 of 78 participants (24.4%) in the supportive psychotherapy group. Mixed models demonstrated that MORE was superior to supportive psychotherapy through 9 months of follow-up for pain severity (between-group effect: 0.49; 95% CI, 0.17-0.81; P = .003) and pain-related functional interference (between-group effect: 1.07; 95% CI, 0.64-1.50; P < .001). Participants in the MORE group reduced their opioid dose to a greater extent than those in the supportive psychotherapy group. The MORE group also had lower emotional distress and opioid craving. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, among adult participants in a primary care setting, the MORE intervention led to sustained improvements in opioid misuse and chronic pain symptoms and reductions in opioid dosing, emotional distress, and opioid craving compared with supportive group psychotherapy. Despite attrition caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the vulnerability of the sample, MORE appeared to be efficacious for reducing opioid misuse among adults with chronic pain.

        "title": "Post-9/11 Veterans and Their Partners Improve Mental Health Outcomes with a Self-directed Mobile and Web-based Wellness Training Program: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Veterans with history of deployment in the Global War on Terror face significant and ongoing challenges with high prevalences of adverse psychological, physical, spiritual, and family impacts. Together, these challenges contribute to an emerging public health crisis likely to extend well into the future. Innovative approaches are needed that reach veterans and their family members with strategies they can employ over time in their daily lives to promote improved adjustment and well-being. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of use of a Web-based, self-directed program of instruction in mind- and body-based wellness skills to be employed by Global War on Terror veterans and their significant relationship partners on mental health and wellness outcomes associated with postdeployment readjustment. METHODS: We recruited 160 veteran-partner dyads in 4 regions of the United States (San Diego, CA; Dallas, TX; Fayetteville, NC; and New York, NY) through publicity by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America to its membership. Dyads were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 study arms: Mission Reconnect (MR) program alone, MR plus the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) for Strong Bonds weekend program for military couples, PREP alone, and waitlist control. We administered a battery of standardized and investigator-generated instruments assessing mental health outcomes at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Dyads in the MR arms were provided Web-based and mobile app video and audio instruction in a set of mindfulness-related stress reduction and contemplative practices, as well as partner massage for reciprocal use. All participants provided weekly reports on frequency and duration of self-care practices for the first 8 weeks, and at 16 weeks. RESULTS: During the first 8-week reporting period, veterans and partners assigned to MR arms used some aspect of the program a mean of 20 times per week, totaling nearly 2.5 hours per week, with only modest declines in use at 16 weeks. Significant improvements were seen at 8 and 16 weeks in measures of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep quality, perceived stress, resilience, self-compassion, and pain for participants assigned to MR arms. In addition, significant reductions in self-reported levels of pain, tension, irritability, anxiety, and depression were associated with use of partner massage. CONCLUSIONS: Both veterans and partners were able to learn and make sustained use of a range of wellness practices taught in the MR program. Home-based, self-directed interventions may be of particular service to veterans who are distant from, averse to, or prohibited by schedule from using professional services. Leveraging the partner relationship may enhance sustained use of self-directed interventions for this population. Use of the MR program appears to be an accessible, low-cost approach that supports well-being and reduces multiple symptoms among post-9/11 veterans and their partners.

Self-compassion-based meditations are also efficacious in reducing BID in non-BCS populations. This parallel, double-blind pilot randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MyCB, with and without an additional meditation component, on BID and related psychological outcomes in BCSs. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (#ACTRN12619001693112). METHODS: BCSs were randomly allocated to MyCB (n = 39), MyCB + Meditation (MyCB + M) (n = 17) or an expressive writing (EW) active control arm (n = 23). The primary outcome was BID. Secondary outcomes were body appreciation, affect (positive and negative), psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress) and self-compassion (state and trait). Assessments were completed online at baseline, post-intervention and 1-month. RESULTS: Adherence to the MyCB writing (45%) and meditation (50%) was modest, and acceptability was high for both MyCB and MyCB + M. Intent to treat linear mixed model analyses indicated: Post-intervention - state self-compassion and positive affect increased for MyCB compared to EW; 1-month: BID scores decreased across all conditions; trait self-compassion increased and anxiety decreased for MyCB + M compared to MyCB and EW. CONCLUSION: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy and potential clinical use of the MyCB brief web-based self-compassion intervention alone and with the addition of meditation, to increase self-compassion and psychological wellbeing in BCSs.",

        "title": "Feasibility of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Surgical Intensive Care Unit Personnel.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical intensive care unit personnel are exposed to catastrophic situations as they care for seriously injured or ill patients. Few interventions have been developed to reduce the negative effects of work stress in this environment. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a workplace intervention for increasing resilience to stress. The intervention was implemented within the unique constraints characteristic of surgical intensive care units. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The mindfulness-based intervention included meditation, mild yoga movement, and music and was conducted in a group format 1 hour a week for 8 weeks in a surgical intensive care unit during work hours. Assessments were performed 1 week before and 1 week after the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention was well received, with a 97% overall retention rate and 100% retention in the intervention group. Work satisfaction, measured with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, increased significantly in the intervention group with no change in the control group. Negative correlations were found between the vigor subscale scores of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and scores for emotional exhaustion on the Maslach Burnout Inventory and scores for burnout on the Professional Quality of Life scale. Participants rated recognizing their stress response as a main benefit of the intervention. CONCLUSION: Workplace group interventions aimed at decreasing the negative effects of stress can be applied within hospital intensive care units. Despite many constraints, attendance at weekly sessions was high. Institutional support was critical for implementation of this program.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Vagus nerve innervation via electrical stimulation and meditative-based diaphragmatic breathing may be promising treatment avenues for fibromyalgia. OBJECTIVE: Explore and compare the treatment effectiveness of active and sham transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) and meditative-based diaphragmatic breathing (MDB) for fibromyalgia. DESIGN: Participants enrolled from March 2019-October 2020 and randomly assigned to active tVNS (n = 28), sham tVNS (n = 29), active MDB (n = 29), or sham MDB (n = 30). Treatments were self-delivered at home for 15 min/morning and 15 min/evening for 14 days. Follow-up was at 2 weeks. SETTING: Outpatient pain clinic in Oslo, Norway. PARTICIPANTS: 116 adults aged 18-65 years with severe fibromyalgia were consecutively enrolled and randomized. 86 participants (74%) had an 80% treatment adherence and 107 (92%) completed the study at 2 weeks; 1 participant dropped out due to adverse effects from active tVNS. INTERVENTIONS: Active tVNS is placed on the cymba conchae of the left ear; sham tVNS is placed on the left earlobe. Active MDB trains users in nondirective meditation with deep breathing; sham MDB trains users in open-awareness meditation with paced breathing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was change from baseline in ultra short-term photoplethysmography-measured cardiac-vagal heart rate variability at 2 weeks. Prior to trial launch, we hypothesized that (1) those randomized to active MDB or active tVNS would display greater increases in heart rate variability compared to those randomized to sham MDB or sham tVNS after 2-weeks; (2) a change in heart rate variability would be correlated with a change in self-reported average pain intensity; and (3) active treatments would outperform sham treatments on all pain-related secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: No significant across-group changes in heart rate variability were found. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between changes in heart rate variability and average pain intensity during treatment. Significant across group differences were found for overall FM severity yet were not found for average pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that changes in cardiac-vagal heart rate variability when recorded with ultra short-term photoplethysmography in those with fibromyalgia may not be associated with treatment-specific changes in pain intensity. Further research should be conducted to evaluate potential changes in long-term cardiac-vagal heart rate variability in response to noninvasive vagus nerve innervation in those with fibromyalgia.

        "title": "Enhancing Social Interaction in Depression (SIDE study): protocol of a randomised controlled trial on the effects of a Cognitively Based Compassion Training (CBCT) for couples.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Positive social interactions (PSIs) and stable relationships can exert substantial benefits on health. However, patients suffering from depression benefit less from these health-promoting effects. Moreover, relationship quality and even partners' health has been found to be negatively affected by depressive symptomatology, which may result in overall impairments in social functioning of a romantic couple. Psychobiological research indicates that these impairments may be accompanied by a maladaptive regulation of the patient's neuroendocrine response to external stressors. Concerning the improvement of social functioning, first studies showed promising results of \"Cognitively Based Compassion Training (CBCT(R))\". However, randomised trials are still scarce. Previous programmes did not involve participation of the patient's romantic partner. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate whether a CBCT(R) programme adapted for couples (CBCT(R)-fC) can improve depressive symptoms, distress, social interaction skills and the neurobiological regulation of stress. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Couples with the female partner suffering from depression will be invited to participate in a pre-to-post intervention assessment on two consecutive days, respectively, involving a standardised PSI task, eye-tracking, ECG recordings, saliva-sampling, blood-sampling and questionnaire data. After baseline assessment, participating couples will be randomised to either a 10 week CBCT(R)-fC or to a treatment as usual control condition. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes encompass self-rated depression (Beck Depression Inventory), attention towards the partners face during PSI (eye tracking), stress-related biomarkers (cortisol, \u03b1-amylase, interleukin (IL)-1\u00df/IL-6, heart rate variability), methylation of oxytocin-receptor-genes and serotonin-transporter-genes and self-ratings of psychological constructs such as relationship quality and empathy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty Heidelberg. Results will be presented in international, peer-reviewed journals and on conferences in the field of clinical psychology and psychiatry. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03080025.",

Information was collected on a semi-structured interview that included the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale to collect suicide attempt history. Past-year opioid misusers, compared to those who used at least one other illicit substance or alcohol in the past year, were more likely to have made a past-year SA. Past-year opioid misuse remained associated with past-year SA in multivariate analysis that included other known risk factors for SA.

        "title": "Impact of a combined multimodal-aerobic and multimodal intervention compared to standard aerobic treatment in breast cancer survivors with chronic cancer-related fatigue - results of a three-armed pragmatic trial in a comprehensive cohort design.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and insomnia are major complaints in breast cancer survivors (BC). Aerobic training (AT), the standard therapy for CRF in BC, shows only minor to moderate treatment effects. Other evidence-based treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy, e.g., sleep education/restriction (SE) and mindfulness-based therapies. We investigated the effectiveness of a 10-week multimodal program (MT) consisting of SE, psycho-education, eurythmy- and painting-therapy, administered separately or in combination with AT (CT) and compared both arms to AT alone. METHODS: In a pragmatic comprehensive cohort study BC with chronic CRF were allocated randomly or by patient preference to (a) MT, (b) CT (MT + AT) or (c) AT alone. Primary endpoint was a composite score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Cancer Fatigue Scale after 10 weeks of intervention (T1); a second endpoint was a follow-up assessment 6 months later (T2). The primary hypothesis stated superiority of CT and non-inferiority of MT vs. AT at T1. A closed testing procedure preserved the global \u03b1-level. The intention-to-treat analysis included propensity scores for the mode of allocation and for the preferred treatment, respectively. RESULTS: Altogether 126 BC were recruited: 65 were randomized and 61 allocated by preference; 105 started the intervention. Socio-demographic parameters were generally balanced at baseline. Non-inferiority of MT to AT at T1 was confirmed (p < 0.05), yet the confirmative analysis stopped as it was not possible to confirm superiority of CT vs. AT (p = 0.119). In consecutive exploratory analyses MT and CT were superior to AT at T1 and T2 (MT) or T2 alone (CT), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal CRF-therapy was found to be confirmatively non-inferior to standard therapy and even yielded exploratively sustained superiority. A randomized controlled trial including a larger sample size and a longer follow-up to evaluate multimodal CRF-therapy is highly warranted. TRIAL REGISTER: DRKS-ID: DRKS00003736 .

        "abstract": "Introduction: Population aging is a global phenomenon that has grown rapidly and progressively all over the world. Interventions that promote health must be studied and implemented to make the aging process be with quality of life. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions that compromise the quality of life on the elderly and it can cause damage to the autonomy and activities of daily life. Mindfulness training has been shown to improve psychological health and quality of life on adults. Studies involving Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) with older people are scarce in the literature, but they have been increasing in recent years showing promising results for healthy aging. This trial will investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an MBI on the quality of life of elderly assisted in the Primary Care. Materials and Methods: A cohort-nested randomized controlled trial with 3 assessment points (baseline, post-intervention and 1-year follow up) will be conducted to compare a MBI program (Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion) to a cognitive stimulation control-group in a Primary Care facility. One-hundred and two older adults will be recruited from a cohort of this facility and they will be randomized and allocated into an intervention group (N = 76) and the control group (N = 76). The primary outcome evaluated will be the improvement of quality of life assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD. The secondary outcomes will be cognitive function, psychological health, sleep quality, self-compassion, and religiosity. Qualitative data will be assessed by focus group and the word free evocation technique. The feasibility of the program will also be evaluated by adherence and unwanted effects questionnaires. Discussion: This cohort-nested clinical trial will be the first mixed-methods study with 3 assessment points which will study the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness-based program for older people in Latin America population. If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of this program in this population it will be possible to consider it as intervention that might be implemented as public policy addressed to older people in healthcare systems.

        "abstract": "A person affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) gradually loses the ability to perform activities of daily living and becomes dependent on caregivers, thereby having a negative impact on the caregivers' quality of life. There is evidence that suggests that interventions aimed at caregivers, such as mindfulness, may be effective at reducing this burden and emotional issues, such as depression and anxiety, and improving their quality of life. However, there is a lack of consistency in the findings and conclusions remain tentative. In addition, as neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) of AD are major determinants of the caregiver's burden, these interventions should examine the relationship between these symptoms and caregiver outcomes. Importantly, to improve the design of therapeutic interventions for caregivers and complement the treatment of AD, aspects related to occupational performance and the participation of people with AD and their caregivers should also be considered. Therefore, this study will aim to examine first, the effects of a mindfulness-based program designed for caregivers on NPSs of AD and caregivers' anxiety and depression; second, the effects of this program on patients' functional capacity, cognitive performance, executive functions, and quality of life, and on caregivers' burden, quality of life, occupational balance, executive functions, psychological wellbeing, and self-compassion. We believe that the findings of this study will have significant implications for future healthcare strategies focused on improving the quality of life and wellbeing of caregivers.",

        "abstract": "Quitting smoking is a major life stressor that results in numerous aversive consequences, including persistently increased level of post-cessation negative affect and relapse. The identification of factors that may enhance behavioral and emotional regulation after quitting may be useful in enhancing quit rates and preventing relapse. One factor broadly linked with behavioral and emotional regulation is mindfulness. This study examined baseline associations of mindfulness with demographic variables, smoking history, dependence, withdrawal severity, and agency among 158 smokers enrolled in a cessation trial. Results indicated that mindfulness was negatively associated with level of nicotine dependence and withdrawal severity, and positively associated with a sense of agency regarding cessation. Moreover, mindfulness remained significantly associated with these measures even after controlling for key demographic variables. Results suggest that low level of mindfulness may be an important predictor of vulnerability to relapse among adult smokers preparing to quit; thus, mindfulness-based interventions may enhance cessation.",

        "title": "No sustained attention differences in a longitudinal randomized trial comparing mindfulness based stress reduction versus active control.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a secular form of meditation training. The vast majority of the extant literature investigating the health effects of mindfulness interventions relies on wait-list control comparisons. Previous studies have found that meditation training over several months is associated with improvements in cognitive control and attention. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a visual continuous performance task (CPT) to test the effects of eight weeks of mindfulness training on sustained attention by comparing MBSR to the Health Enhancement Program (HEP), a structurally equivalent, active control condition in a randomized, longitudinal design (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01301105) focusing on a non-clinical population typical of MBSR participants. Researchers were blind to group assignment. 63 community participants were randomized to either MBSR (n = 31) or HEP (n = 32). CPT analyses were conducted on 29 MBSR participants and 25 HEP participants. We predicted that MBSR would improve visual discrimination ability and sustained attention over time on the CPT compared to HEP, with more home practice associated with greater improvements. Our hypotheses were not confirmed but we did find some evidence for improved visual discrimination similar to effects in partial replication of other research. Our study had sufficient power to demonstrate that intervention groups do not differ in their improvement over time in sustained attention performance. One of our primary predictions concerning the effects of intervention on attentional fatigue was significant but not interpretable. CONCLUSIONS: Attentional sensitivity is not affected by mindfulness practice as taught in MBSR, but it is unclear whether mindfulness might positively affect another aspect of attention, vigilance. These results also highlight the relevant procedural modifications required by future research to correctly investigate the role of sustained attention in similar samples.

        "title": "Mindfulness-Based Crisis Interventions for patients with psychotic symptoms on acute psychiatric wards (amBITION study): Protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inpatient psychiatric care is a scarce and expensive resource in the National Health Service (NHS), with chronic bed shortages being partly driven by high re-admission rates. People often need to go into hospital when they have a mental health crisis due to overwhelming distressing psychotic symptoms, such as hearing voices (hallucinations) or experiencing unusual beliefs (delusions). Brief talking therapies may be helpful for people during an acute inpatient admission as an adjunct to medication in reducing re-admission rates, and despite promising findings from trials in the USA, there have not yet been any clinical trials on this kind of intervention within NHS settings. METHODS/DESIGN: The amBITION study is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a manualised brief talking therapy (Mindfulness-Based Crisis Intervention; MBCI). Inpatients on acute psychiatric wards are eligible for the study if they report at least one positive psychotic symptom, and are willing and able to engage in a talking therapy. In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), participants will be randomly allocated to receive either MBCI or a control intervention (Social Activity Therapy; SAT) which will be based on doing activities on the ward with the therapist. The primary objective of the study is to find out whether it is possible to carry out this kind of trial successfully within UK inpatient settings and to find out whether patients and staff find it an acceptable intervention. The secondary objective is to collect pilot data on primary and secondary outcome measures, including re-admission rates at 6 month follow-up. This will provide information on the appropriateness of re-admission as the primary outcome measure for future efficacy trials, as well as data on the acceptability and utility of the clinical self-report measures. DISCUSSION: The results of the feasibility trial will indicate whether a subsequent efficacy pilot trial is warranted, and if so, will provide vital information for the planning of such a trial (e.g. pilot data on expected effect sizes). If future research finds that MBCI is an effective and safe intervention, then patients will benefit from access to better treatment within inpatient care which would reduce re-admission rates. This trial therefore addresses an area of urgent concern for service users, clinicians and the wider NHS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN37625384.",

        "title": "Mindful awareness as a mechanism of change for natural childbirth in pregnant women with high fear of childbirth: a randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) is effective in increasing natural childbirth in pregnant women with high fear of childbirth (FOC) as compared to enhanced care as usual (ECAU). We aimed to examine through which pathway of action MBCP reaches this effect, based on a model of approaching or avoiding the challenges related to childbirth. METHODS: One hundred eleven pregnant women with high FOC were measured pre- and post-intervention on FOC (emotion pathway), catastrophic beliefs about labour pain (cognition pathway) and mindful awareness (attention pathway). A multiple mediation model was used to examine through which pathway the mechanism of change operated in relation to approach (i.e., natural childbirth) versus avoidance (i.e., self-requested caesarean section). RESULTS: It was found that greater mindful awareness (18% R(2) = 0.18, F[1107] = 22.77, p < 0.0001) was the only significant mechanism of change operating through the attentional pathway leading to natural childbirth. More specifically, nonreactivity to inner experience (a facet of mindful awareness) showed to be the strongest mechanism of change. More extensive meditation practice was positively associated with natural childbirth; however, the number of completed MBCP sessions was not associated with the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in mindful awareness was the strongest mechanism of change for better adaptation to the challenges of childbirth. Decreases in neither FOC nor catastrophic beliefs about labour pain were identified as mechanisms of change. Additionally, the more one meditated, the more one was inclined towards a natural childbirth. MBCP enhances adaptation to the challenges of childbirth and less use of obstetric interventions in the presence of high FOC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR; 4302 ).",

The socio-economic and political friction in low- and middle-income countries adds to their vulnerability and calls for a cost-effective indigenous intervention. Consequently, this study aimed to inform a large definitive trial by assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design evaluating a culturally adapted online Mindfulness Training Course (MTC) used to improve stress and wellbeing among Pakistani university students. A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted. University students (n = 156) were randomly assigned to either the MTC group (n = 80) or Wait-list (WL) control group (n = 76) and completed baseline and post-intervention self-report measures for mindfulness, stress and psychological wellbeing. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with consenting MTC group participants (n = 18) to explore their views about MTC, employing reflexive thematic analysis. Of 80 participants randomized to the MTC group, 32 completed the course, whereas, from the 156 randomized participants, 102 completed assessment surveys. Feasibility and acceptability indicators showed high recruitment, compliance, and adherence to MTC, with practical steps for randomization and online data collection. Further results showed higher levels of mindfulness and psychological wellbeing and lowered stress levels in the MTC group compared to the control group. The attrition and dropout rates were high; however, the feedback from participants who completed the MTC was highly positive and encouraging. In conclusion, if the trial proceeds with increased outreach in a large-scale RCT, the recruitment might be revised to reduce attrition rates. Further recommendations are discussed.",

        "title": "Does a Brief Mindfulness Exercise Improve Outcomes in Upper Extremity Patients? A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions are useful in reducing psychologic distress and pain intensity in patients with chronic pain. However, most mindfulness-based interventions are resource-intensive, lengthy, and not feasible for busy orthopaedic surgical practices. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to determine if a 60-second personalized mindfulness-based video exercise is (1) associated with improved pain intensity, emotional distress, and state anxiety compared with an attention placebo control (a time-matched educational pamphlet about pain and stress); and (2) feasible and acceptable for patients with upper extremity injury in an orthopaedic practice. METHODS: This was a single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial of the mindfulness-based video exercise (60 seconds duration, free online) versus an attention placebo control (an educational pamphlet about pain and stress presented to patients to read over 60 seconds). One hundred forty-nine patients presenting for a new or followup appointment at the office of one of two orthopaedic hand and upper extremity outpatient surgical practices at an urban academic hospital were invited to participate between September 2016 and December 2016. Of 149 patients screened, 125 patients were randomized and completed a demographic questionnaire, the Numeric Rating Scale to assess pain intensity, the State Anxiety subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess state anxiety, and Emotion Thermometers to assess anxiety, anger, and depression before and after the interventions. Postintervention, patients also completed the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire Scale-3 to assess the acceptability. A mean score of 21 or higher is considered acceptable. Feasibility was determined based on number of patients approached who refused participation. The intervention was defined as feasible if refusal rate was lower than 25%. Analysis of covariance was used to test comparative improved pain intensity on the NRS, psychologic distress on the Emotion Thermometers, and state anxiety on the State Anxiety Subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Index after controlling for respective baseline scores. A 1-point minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was used on the NRS for pain intensity. RESULTS: Adjusted for the baseline means, compared with patients who received the attention placebo control, patients who participated in the mindfulness-based video exercise demonstrated improved pain intensity (mindfulness-based video exercise: 3.03 \u00b1 0.12; control: 3.49 \u00b1 0.12; mean difference: 0.46 [0.12-0.80]; p = 0.008); state anxiety (mindfulness-based video exercise: 32.35 \u00b1 0.59; control: 35.29 \u00b1 0.59; mean difference: 2.94 [1.29-4.59]; p = 0.001); anxiety symptoms (mindfulness-based video exercise: 1.49 \u00b1 0.19; control: 2.10 \u00b1 0.19; mean difference: 0.61 [0.08-1.14]; p = 0.024); depression (mindfulness-based video exercise: 1.03 \u00b1 0.10; control: 1.47 \u00b1 0.11; mean difference: 0.44 [0.15-0.73]; p = 0.004); and anger (mindfulness-based video exercise: 0.76 \u00b1 0.12; control: 1.36 \u00b1 0.12; mean difference: 0.60 [0.26-0.94]; p = 0.001). However, the observed differences in pain intensity were below 1 point on the NRS, which is the MCID established in patients with chronic pain. No MCID is available for the other measures. The mindfulness-based video exercise was feasible based on a dropout rate of 0%, and acceptability reached the medium range with similar scores in both groups (mindfulness-based video exercise: 20.70 \u00b1 5.48; control: 20.52 \u00b1 6.42). CONCLUSIONS: A 60-second mindfulness-based video exercise is feasible to implement and acceptable to patients in busy orthopaedic practices. This video exercise is also effective in improving momentary pain, anxiety, depression, and anger in this population, but it is unclear whether these improved pain and distress levels are meaningful to patients who present with low levels of pain and psychologic distress. Future studies should seek to discern whether the improved pain and distress levels we observed are clinically important or whether the intervention delivers larger effects in subgroups of patients experiencing greater pain intensity and if the improved pain and distress levels are durable. Such studies might also assess cost-effectiveness, because this mindfulness-based tool takes little time and few resources to use, and the effects and durability of multiple sessions of a mindfulness-based video exercise.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Strategies to improve influenza vaccine protection among elderly individuals are an important research priority. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and exercise have been shown to affect aspects of immune function in some populations.

RESULTS: No differences in vaccine responses were found comparing control to MBSR or exercise. Individuals achieving seroprotective levels of influenza antibody \u2265160 units had higher optimism, less anxiety, and lower perceived stress than the nonresponders. Age correlated with influenza antibody responses, but not with IFN\u03b3 or IL-10 production.

        "abstract": "PROBLEM: Low prenatal well-being has adverse outcomes for mother and infant but few interventions currently exist to promote and maintain prenatal well-being. BACKGROUND: Mindfulness and gratitude based interventions consistently demonstrate benefits in diverse populations. Interventions integrating these constructs have potential to improve psychological and physiological health during pregnancy. AIM: The aim of this pilot study is to examine the effect of a novel gratitude and mindfulness based intervention on prenatal stress, cortisol levels, and well-being. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted with 46 pregnant women. Participants used an online mindfulness and gratitude intervention 4 times a week for 3 weeks. Measures of prenatal stress, salivary cortisol, gratitude, mindfulness, and satisfaction with life were completed at baseline, 1.5 weeks later, and 3 weeks later. FINDINGS: Intervention participants demonstrated significant reductions in prenatal stress in comparison to the control condition (p=.04). Within subjects reductions in waking (p=.004) and evening cortisol (p>.001) measures were observed for intervention participants. Significant effects were not observed for other well-being outcomes. DISCUSSION: Reducing self-report and physiological stress in pregnancy can improve maternal and infant outcomes. The findings of this pilot study indicate potential direct effects of the intervention on self-reported stress in comparison to a treatment-as-usual control. Effects on a biomarker of stress, cortisol, were also observed within the intervention group. CONCLUSION: A brief mindfulness and gratitude based intervention has the potential to reduce stress in pregnancy. Future research is needed to further explore mechanisms and potential benefits of such interventions.",

        "abstract": "The increasing mental health issues among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of delivering face-to-face interventions during lockdowns have increased the demand for online interventions. The report presents results from a randomized controlled trial investigating the benefits of online mindfulness interventions delivered by videoconference or podcast during the early phase of the pandemic in Germany. Fifty university students were randomized to a mindfulness intervention conducted by videoconference (n = 25) or to an unguided training provided by podcasts (n = 25). All students participated in a 7-week mindfulness intervention. Outcome measures included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction preintervention and postintervention. The study showed a larger reduction in depression in the videoconferencing group than in the podcast group across per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. There was a significant increase in mindfulness (PP and ITT samples) and life satisfaction (ITT sample) in both groups. The frequency of home practice was related to positive changes in outcomes but only for the videoconferencing group. The results suggest that mindfulness training delivered via videoconferencing can be a viable option to address depressive symptoms among students. However, both interventions were effective in increasing mindfulness and life satisfaction.",

        "title": "Efficacy of mindfulness-based intervention ('mindfulness-based joyful sleep') in young and middle-aged individuals with insomnia using a biomarker of inflammatory responses: a prospective protocol of a randomised controlled trial in China.",
        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is a prevalent and significant public health concern. Insomnia can lead to increased inflammatory markers associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are more easily delivered within the community than cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) which was recommended as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, are effective in insomnia treatment and can reduce inflammatory markers level in older individuals with insomnia. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of an MBI to CBT-I in young and middle-aged individuals with insomnia disorder and explore its effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in inflammation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This report describes a protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Seventy eligible participants will be assigned to mindfulness-based joyful sleep or CBT-I for 2-hour sessions weekly for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, severity of insomnia symptoms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and sleep parameters recorded using sleep diary and polysomnography. Secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression. The exploratory outcome is serum level of NF-\u03baB. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the ntervention period and at a 3 month follow-up. Data will be analysed using general linear models, specifically analysis of covariance and analysis of variance will be used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China (2018-S236). If Mindfulness-Based Joyful Sleep is proven effective, its dissemination will help bridge the gap between the unmet need and the demand for insomnia interventions in China.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because as many as 46% of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients experience clinical symptoms of shock anxiety, this randomized controlled study evaluated the efficacy of adapted yoga (vs usual care) in reducing clinical psychosocial risks shown to impact morbidity and mortality in ICD recipients. METHODS: Forty-six participants were randomized to a control group or an 8-week adapted yoga group that followed a standardized protocol with weekly classes and home practice. Medical and psychosocial data were collected at baseline and follow-up, then compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Total shock anxiety decreased for the yoga group and increased for the control group, t(4.43, 36), P < 0.0001, with significant differences between these changes. Similarly, consequential anxiety decreased for the yoga group but increased for the control group t(2.86,36) P = 0.007. Compared to the control, the yoga group had greater overall self-compassion, t(-2.84,37), P = 0.007, and greater mindfulness, t(-2.10,37) P = 0.04, at the end of the study. Exploratory analyses utilizing a linear model (R(2) = 0.98) of observed device-treated ventricular (DTV) events revealed that the expected number of DTV events in the yoga group was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.0001). Compared to the control, the yoga group had a 32% lower risk of experiencing device-related firings at end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated psychosocial benefits from a program of adapted yoga (vs usual care) for ICD recipients. These data support continued research to better understand the role of complementary medicine to address ICD-specific stress in cardiac outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Stress and negative mood during pregnancy increase risk for poor childbirth outcomes and postnatal mood problems and may interfere with mother-infant attachment and child development. However, relatively little research has focused on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions to reduce stress and negative mood during pregnancy. In this study, we developed and pilot tested an eight-week mindfulness-based intervention directed toward reducing stress and improving mood in pregnancy and early postpartum. We then conducted a small randomized trial (n=31) comparing women who received the intervention during the last half of their pregnancy to a wait-list control group. Measures of perceived stress, positive and negative affect, depressed and anxious mood, and affect regulation were collected prior to, immediately following, and three months after the intervention (postpartum). Mothers who received the intervention showed significantly reduced anxiety (effect size, 0.89; p<0.05) and negative affect (effect size, 0.83; p<0.05) during the third trimester in comparison to those who did not receive the intervention. The brief and nonpharmaceutical nature of this intervention makes it a promising candidate for use during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of age and depressive symptom severity on changes in positive affect among older adults randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program or a Waitlist Control group. Drawing from the Motivational Theory of Life-Span Development, we hypothesized that lower levels of depressive symptom severity and older age would be associated with greater positive affect in response to the MBSR intervention. METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of community-dwelling English-speaking adults (n = 200) aged \u2265 65, randomly assigned to an eight-week MBSR program or a Waitlist Control group. Our main outcome variable was a five-item measure of positive affect, which was measured at study entry as well as eight weeks and six months later. RESULTS: At the six-month follow-up, we observed group by baseline depressive symptom severity (beta = -.17, p = .02) and group by baseline depressive symptom severity by age (beta = -.14, p = .05) interactions. Among MBSR participants, greater baseline depressive symptom severity was also associated with less improvement in positive affect at the six-month follow-up (beta = -.30, p = .003). Findings were qualified by a significant depressive symptom severity by age interaction (beta = -.25, p = .01), such that MBSR participants who were 70 and over with lower baseline depressive symptom severity having the greatest improvement in positive affect at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: MBSR improves positive affect for older adults with lower depressive symptom severity, perhaps because it capitalizes on naturalistic changes in control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Current treatment practices for older adult women with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) remain insufficient and ineffective. A randomized controlled feasibility trial was developed to evaluate three determinants of research feasibility and three determinants of intervention feasibility when comparing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with a health enhancement program (HEP) in older adult women with UUI. Participants were recruited from the university health system, county senior centers, and community sites. Twenty-five postmenopausal women (mean age = 74 years) were randomized into MBSR treatment conditions or HEP comparison conditions for an 8-week intervention. Participants remained blinded to conditions. Research feasibility determinants were measured as recruitment, retention, and treatment delivery; intervention feasibility determinants were measured as acceptability, tolerability, and client receipt/enactment. Feasibility determinants established in the research literature as essential to intervention evaluation were recorded and evaluated throughout the current study. All six feasibility determinants confirmed positive results in the enrolled population. The use of MBSR and HEP as the active comparison to treat UUI in older adult women proved feasible in this trial. The results warrant the design of a larger-scale, multisite trial to study the efficacy of MBSR in treating UUI in older adult women. TARGETS: Older adult women with high incidence of UUI.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A substantial proportion of trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) continue to experience symptoms even after trauma-focused therapies. Internet-based interventions could facilitate access to treatment for PTSD and CPTSD. The current pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based internet intervention on PTSD and CPTSD symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with two measurement points (pre-test and post-test) was used to investigate the effects of a structured mindfulness-based internet intervention on PTSD and CPTSD symptoms as well as anxiety, depression, and positive mental health. In total, 70 university students with high levels of PTSD and CPTSD symptoms based on ICD-11 criteria participated in the study: 31 in the intervention group and 39 in the waiting list control group. RESULTS: We found that the mindfulness-based internet intervention reduced CPTSD disturbances in self-organization (DSO) symptoms (ES = - 0.48 [- 0.96; 0.00]), particularly negative self-concept (ES = - 0.72 [- 1.21; - 0.24]) and disturbances in relationships (ES = - 0.55 [- 1.03; - 0.07]). Moreover, the intervention reduced the symptoms of PTSD sense of threat (ES = - 0.48 [- 0.96; - 0.01]) and promoted positive mental health (ES = 0.51 [0.03; 0.99]). High user satisfaction and good usability of the intervention were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Promising treatment effects were found, indicating that mindfulness-based internet intervention can reduce CPTSD symptoms and have a positive effect on mental health among youth in general.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuropsychopharmacologic effects of long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) in the context of chronic pain may result in subjective anhedonia coupled with decreased attention to natural rewards. Yet, there are no known efficacious treatments for anhedonia and reward deficits associated with chronic opioid use. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a novel behavioral intervention combining training in mindfulness with savoring of natural rewards, may hold promise for treating anhedonia in LTOT. METHODS: Veterans receiving LTOT (N = 63) for chronic pain were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or a supportive group (SG) psychotherapy control. Before and after the 8-week treatment groups, we assessed the effects of MORE on the late positive potential (LPP) of the electroencephalogram and skin conductance level (SCL) during viewing and up-regulating responses (i.e. savoring) to natural reward cues. We then examined whether these neurophysiological effects were associated with reductions in subjective anhedonia by 4-month follow-up. RESULTS: Patients treated with MORE demonstrated significantly increased LPP and SCL to natural reward cues and greater decreases in subjective anhedonia relative to those in the SG. The effect of MORE on reducing anhedonia was statistically mediated by increases in LPP response during savoring. CONCLUSIONS: MORE enhances motivated attention to natural reward cues among chronic pain patients on LTOT, as evidenced by increased electrocortical and sympathetic nervous system responses. Given neurophysiological evidence of clinical target engagement, MORE may be an efficacious treatment for anhedonia among chronic opioid users, people with chronic pain, and those at risk for opioid use disorder.",

        "title": "Effects of a 12-Minute Smartphone-Based Mindful Breathing Task on Heart Rate Variability for Students With Clinically Relevant Chronic Pain, Depression, and Anxiety: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a commonly used psychological intervention for pain, mood, and anxiety conditions, but can be challenging to practice with severe symptoms without proper training. The Mindfulness Meditation app (MMA) is a supportive training tool specifically developed for this study to aid in the practice of mindful breathing using a smartphone. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the psychophysiological effects of the MMA. Specifically, the study will assess parasympathetic functioning using heart rate variability (HRV; primary outcome), pain and mood symptoms, mind-wandering and present moment awareness, and breath focus in groups of undergraduate participants who self-report clinically-relevant symptoms of chronic pain (CP) and depression or anxiety (DA) and condition-free (CF) participants who do not meet either criteria. We hypothesize that use of the MMA by study groups will lead to improved HRV, pain, and mood symptoms compared with groups who do not use the app. METHODS: This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruiting through a Web-based research participation pool at York University in Toronto, Canada. We are aiming for minimum 60 participants in each of CP, DA, and CF groups. Upon arriving to the laboratory, participants will be prescreened for classification into groups of CP, DA, or CF. Groups will be randomly assigned by a 1:1 ratio to an MMA (MMA+) condition or MM condition without the app (MMA-) after a brief stress induction procedure. In MMA+, participants will practice mindful breathing with a smartphone and press breath or other buttons at the sound of audio tones if their awareness was on breathing or another experience, respectively. HRV and respiration data will be obtained during rest (5 min), stress induction (5 min), and meditation conditions (12 min). Participants will complete psychological self-report inventories before and after the stress induction and after the meditation condition. Separate linear mixed models will be used to examine HRV and self-report inventories comparing groups and treatment conditions. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in November 2017 and is expected to be completed in winter of 2019-2020. As of July 2019, 189 participants have been recruited. The study's main findings are expected to reveal a positive pattern of HRV responses in the CP, DA, and CF groups, such that a significant increase in HRV (P<.05) is detected in those randomized to the MMA+ condition in comparison with those randomized to the MMA- condition. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT will contribute to the burgeoning health psychology literature regarding the clinical relevance of HRV in assessment and treatment of psychological and medical conditions. Furthermore, possible ways to inform designs of MM training tools delivered by apps and Web platforms for CP, depression, and anxiety conditions' treatment will be discussed.

        "title": "An e-mental health intervention to reduce depression symptoms in individuals with obesity: study protocol for the randomized, controlled, two-armed, confirmatory LightMood trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with obesity often experience psychological distress, specifically depression symptoms. Due to various barriers, such as limitations of healthcare offers, digital interventions, for example medical apps, can provide a suitable approach to support affected people. In the envisaged prospective randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the efficacy of the LightMood intervention. The LightMood intervention is a manualized and user-centered, digital intervention for patients with obesity, with a duration of 4 months, which contains elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based and skills-based exercises. We expect the LightMood intervention to be superior to treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of reducing depression symptoms. METHODS: The trial incorporates four distinct measurement time points: the baseline assessment, the post-treatment assessment, and 1- and 3-month follow-up assessments. Furthermore, we implemented in-treatment assessments for both groups. Participants will be randomized into two groups (LightMood intervention vs TAU). The aim is to include 128 participants (64 per group) in the study. Inclusion criteria are patients who are obese, at least 18 years old, with a private Internet access, and with adequate digital literacy and show depression symptoms (PHQ \u2265 10). Exclusion criteria are weekly outpatient individual psychotherapy, obesity surgery within the last year or planned within the next 7 months, no private Internet access, and the prescription of a new psychotropic drug within the last 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the post-assessment reduction in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include the improvement in self-efficacy, quality of life, mindfulness, reduction in eating disorder symptoms, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we expect a positive development of depression symptoms throughout the different time points (T1, T2, and T3) in patients with obesity. DISCUSSION: LightMood is an evidence-based, efficient, low-threshold online intervention that aims to reduce depression symptoms in people with obesity. Online interventions could offer a promising alternative to conventional face-to-face therapy. The primary objective of the current study is to add essential insight into the feasibility, efficacy, effectiveness, and acceptance of e-mental health interventions for people with obesity and depression symptoms.

        "title": "Effectiveness of Mindfulness Meditation vs Headache Education for Adults With Migraine: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Most patients with migraine discontinue medications due to inefficacy or adverse effects. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) may provide benefit. OBJECTIVE: To determine if MBSR improves migraine outcomes and affective/cognitive processes compared with headache education. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial of MBSR vs headache education included 89 adults who experienced between 4 and 20 migraine days per month. There was blinding of participants (to active vs comparator group assignments) and principal investigators/data analysts (to group assignment). INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent MBSR (standardized training in mindfulness/yoga) or headache education (migraine information) delivered in groups that met for 2 hours each week for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in migraine day frequency (baseline to 12 weeks). Secondary outcomes were changes in disability, quality of life, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, depression scores, and experimentally induced pain intensity and unpleasantness (baseline to 12, 24, and 36 weeks). RESULTS: Most participants were female (n = 82, 92%), with a mean (SD) age of 43.9 (13.0) years, and had a mean (SD) of 7.3 (2.7) migraine days per month and high disability (Headache Impact Test-6: 63.5 [5.7]), attended class (median attendance, 7 of 8 classes), and followed up through 36 weeks (33 of 45 [73%] of the MBSR group and 32 of 44 [73%] of the headache education group). Participants in both groups had fewer migraine days at 12 weeks (MBSR: -1.6 migraine days per month; 95% CI, -0.7 to -2.5; headache education: -2.0 migraine days per month; 95% CI, -1.1 to -2.9), without group differences (P = .50). Compared with those who participated in headache education, those who participated in MBSR had improvements from baseline at all follow-up time points (reported in terms of point estimates of effect differences between groups) on measures of disability (5.92; 95% CI, 2.8-9.0; P < .001), quality of life (5.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.9; P = .01), self-efficacy (8.2; 95% CI, 0.3-16.1; P = .04), pain catastrophizing (5.8; 95% CI, 2.9-8.8; P < .001), depression scores (1.6; 95% CI, 0.4-2.7; P = .008), and decreased experimentally induced pain intensity and unpleasantness (MBSR group: 36.3% [95% CI, 12.3% to 60.3%] decrease in intensity and 30.4% [95% CI, 9.9% to 49.4%] decrease in unpleasantness; headache education group: 13.5% [95% CI, -9.9% to 36.8%] increase in intensity and an 11.2% [95% CI, -8.9% to 31.2%] increase in unpleasantness; P = .004 for intensity and .005 for unpleasantness, at 36 weeks). One reported adverse event was deemed unrelated to study protocol. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mindfulness-based stress reduction did not improve migraine frequency more than headache education, as both groups had similar decreases; however, MBSR improved disability, quality of life, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, and depression out to 36 weeks, with decreased experimentally induced pain suggesting a potential shift in pain appraisal. In conclusion, MBSR may help treat total migraine burden, but a larger, more definitive study is needed to further investigate these results.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study tested the acceptability and efficacy of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based intervention (LIFEwithIBD) in people with IBD through a two-arm RCT. METHODS: Participants were recruited at the Gastroenterology Department of the Coimbra University Hospital between June and September 2019. Of the 355 patients screened, those who accepted to participate were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: experimental group (LIFEwithIBD; n = 25) or control group (waitlist; n = 29). Participants completed self-report measures at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Intervention acceptability was assessed. Efficacy was examined using intent-to-treat ANCOVA at post-intervention after adjusting for baseline values of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms (primary outcomes). Linear mixed models for all longitudinal outcomes were also analysed. Inflammatory and disease biomarkers were determined at T0 and T3. RESULTS: Acceptability results revealed a high level of satisfaction and perceived usefulness regarding the intervention. Both groups experienced a significant decrease in stress symptoms and IBD symptom perception at T1. No significant differences were observed at follow-up for the primary outcomes. The experimental group reported significantly lower Crohn's disease Symptom severity at T2 than the control group. Post-hoc analyses designed to mitigate floor effects revealed substantial treatment effects for the experimental group regarding anxiety symptoms. No significant differences were observed in clinical biomarkers from T0 to T3. CONCLUSION: The LIFEwithIBD intervention shows promising, although preliminary, benefits for managing disease activity and reducing anxiety symptoms in IBD patients with high severity of psychological distress.Clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03840707, identifier NCT03840707.",

        "abstract": "Long-term stress can lead to long-term increased cortisol plasma levels, which increases the risk of numerous diseases. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated form dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), together DHEA(S), have shown to counteract some of the effects of cortisol and may be protective during stress. The program \"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction\" (MBSR) has shown to have positive effects on stress. The present study examined a possible effect of MBSR on DHEAS in plasma compared to a waiting list and a locally developed stress reduction program (LSR) in people with self-reported stress. The study was a three-armed randomized controlled trial conducted in a municipal health care center in Denmark. It included 71 participants with self-reported stress randomized to either MBSR (n = 24) or LSR (n = 23), or a waiting list (n = 24). Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks follow-up to estimate effects of MBSR on DHEAS. The effect of MBSR on DHEAS was statistically significant compared to both the waiting list and LSR. We found a mean effect of 0.70 \u03bcmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18-1.22) higher DHEAS in the MBSR group compared with the waiting list group and a mean effect of 0.54 \u03bcmol/L (95% CI = 0.04-1.05) higher DHEAS in the MBSR group compared with the LSR group. Findings indicate an effect on DHEAS of the MBSR program compared to a waiting list and LSR program in people with self-reported stress. However, we consider our findings hypothesis-generating and validation by future studies is essential.",

        "title": "Meditation or Medication? Mindfulness training versus medication in the treatment of childhood ADHD: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder (ADHD) is, with a prevalence of 5 %, a highly common childhood disorder, and has severe impact on the lives of youngsters and their families. Medication is often the treatment of choice, as it currently is most effective. However, medication has only short-term effects, treatment adherence is often low and most importantly; medication has serious side effects. Therefore, there is a need for other interventions for youngsters with ADHD. Mindfulness training is emerging as a potentially effective training for children and adolescents with ADHD. The aim of this study is to compare the (cost) effectiveness of mindfulness training to the (cost) effectiveness of methylphenidate in children with ADHD on measures of attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter randomized controlled trial with 2 follow-up measurements will be used to measure the effects of mindfulness training versus the effects of methylphenidate. Participants will be youngsters (aged 9 to 18) of both sexes diagnosed with ADHD, referred to urban and rural mental healthcare centers. We aim to include 120 families. The mindfulness training, using the MYmind protocol, will be conducted in small groups, and consists of 8 weekly 1.5-h sessions. Youngsters learn to focus and enhance their attention, awareness, and self-control by doing mindfulness exercises. Parents will follow a parallel mindful parenting training in which they learn to be fully present in the here and now with their child in a non-judgmental way, to take care of themselves, and to respond rather than react to difficult behavior of their child. Short-acting methylphenidate will be administered individually and monitored by a child psychiatrist. Assessments will take place at pre-test, post-test, and at follow-up 1 and 2 (respectively 4 and 10 months after the start of treatment). Informants are parents, children, teachers, and researchers. DISCUSSION: This study will inform mental health care professionals and health insurance companies about the clinical and cost effectiveness of mindfulness training for children and adolescents with ADHD and their parents compared to the effectiveness of methylphenidate. Limitations and several types of bias that are anticipated for this study are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register: NTR4206 . Registered 11 October 2013.",

        "abstract": "Prevalence rates of peripartum depression and anxiety are high and correlate with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been shown to reduce mental distress during pregnancy. A multicenter, randomized controlled study was conducted after screening for depressive symptoms. The intervention group (IG) was given access to an 8-week supervised eMBI between weeks 29 and 36 of pregnancy and followed up to 5 months postpartum. Psychometric data were collected using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R), the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI-14) as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Out of 5299 pregnant women, 1153 scored >9 on the EPDS and N = 460 were included in the RCT. No significant interaction effects for depressive symptoms and anxiety were found. Pregnancy- and birth-related anxiety decreased significantly in the IG and 6 weeks after birth, the rate of women at risk for adverse mental outcome was significantly lower compared to the CG. Mindfulness scores improved significantly in the IG. The eMBI program did not show effective regarding general depressive or anxiety symptoms, however, positive results were demonstrated regarding pregnancy and birth-related anxiety and the prevention of postpartum depression.",

Approximately 10 months post-treatment, 108 participants completed structured qualitative interviews to express how the study treatment affected their life or health. Responses were qualitatively analyzed to generate a set of themes and subthemes, with between-groups comparisons to evaluate differences (if any) in treatment-response between MBT and CBT-CP. A majority of participants (n = 88, 81.5%) across both groups reflected positively on the study intervention and outcomes, identifying benefits in pain management (31.5%), meditation and mindfulness skills (25.9%), and relaxation skills (22.2%). Perceived benefits varied widely, suggesting no one intervention may be ideal for CLBP.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is evidence suggesting that quarantine might have undesirable psychological impacts on the patients. Therefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. METHOD: This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2 weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitive-behavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks. RESULTS: Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean = 29.42; SD = 4.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Mean(intervention) = 81.74; Mean(control) = 72.86; adjusted t (46) = 2.10; p = 0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2 = 0.83) and fewer perceived stress (Mean(intervention) = 22.15; Mean(control) = 29.45; adjusted t (46) = 2.66; p = 0.01; CI: - 12.81 to - 1.78; dppc2 = - 0.77) after 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19. The present results could help mental health professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to promote patients' resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease.

        "title": "A WeChat-based self-compassion training to improve the treatment adherence of patients with schizophrenia in China: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: At present, adherence to antipsychotic treatment is often poor, leading to the recurrence of symptoms. This increases the likelihood of the patient experiencing disability and thus increases the disease burden for the patient, their family, and society as a whole. However, to date, there is no clear evidence regarding the effect of medication adherence interventions on outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, the traditional intervention methods are limited by manpower and resources in low- and middle-income countries. Recent studies have demonstrated that increasing a patient's level of self-compassion may improve their treatment adherence. Online mental health care interventions have advantages in terms of feasibility and acceptability for patients with schizophrenia. In this regard, a WeChat-based self-compassion training protocol to improve patient treatment adherence was designed in this study and will be evaluated in the future to determine its impact on patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: The protocol for the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is based on the SPIRIT 2013 statement. This parallel RCT will aim to recruit 392 patients with schizophrenia who will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into a 3-week intervention or control group. Both groups will receive routine care. The intervention group will also receive WeChat-based self-compassion training, which requires participants to complete three tasks every day, including a reading task, a meditation task, and a self-compassion journal task. The control group will receive WeChat-based psychological health education, which will only require participants to read positive articles about psychological health every day. Medication adherence, self-compassion, stigma, and social support will be measured at baseline (T(0)), immediately after the intervention (T(1)), and 3 weeks after the intervention (T(2)). Program feasibility will be evaluated throughout the course of the study, and acceptability will be measured immediately after the intervention (T(1)). EXPECTED RESULTS: The intervention described here will address the barriers to accessing mental health care for people with schizophrenia, including patients' desire for independent management, difficulty accessing providers, and concerns about privacy and stigma. The current study provides guidance for clinical nurses to carry out psychological intervention, with the ultimate aim of addressing the problems associated with a shortage of psychological professionals in low- and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caregiver stress can pose serious health and psychological concerns, highlighting the importance of timely interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia. Single-session mindfulness-based interventions could be a promising yet under-researched approach to enhancing their mental well-being within their unpredictable, time-constrained contexts. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of a blended mindfulness-based intervention consisting of a single session and app-based follow-up in reducing caregiver stress. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with two arms (intervention versus an education session on dementia care) and assessments at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months. The eligibility criteria include: family caregivers aged 18 years or older; providing care for an individual with a confirmed medical diagnosis of dementia for at least 3 months prior to recruitment, with a minimum of 4 hours of daily contact; and exhibiting a high level of caregiver stress. The intervention comprises a 90-minute group-based session with various mindfulness practices and psychoeducation. Participants will receive a self-practice toolkit to guide their practice over a duration of 8 weeks. Sharing activities will be implemented through an online social media platform. The primary outcome is perceived caregiving stress. The secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, positive aspects of caregiving, dyadic relationship, trait mindfulness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms of care recipients. The feasibility outcomes include eligibility and enrollment, attendance, adherence to self-practice, and retention, assessed using mixed methods. DISCUSSION: The study will contribute to the evidence base by investigating whether a single-session mindfulness intervention is effective and feasible for reducing caregiver stress among family caregivers of people with dementia.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mindfulness-based intervention for hypertension with depression and/or anxiety. METHODS: 10-week mindfulness-based intervention, including health education for hypertension, exclusively for the control group, was administered to the intervention group to assist sixty hypertension patients with depression/anxiety. Among them, the intervention group comprised 8 men and 22 women, with a mean age of 60.02 years and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.29 years. The control group consisted of 14 men and 16 women with a mean age of 57.68 years and a mean duration of hypertension of 6.32 years. The severity of depressive and/or anxiety symptoms was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), along with blood pressure (BP) measurements taken twice daily. The study utilized a self-made self-efficacy scale and awareness of physical and mental health to evaluate mental health and state. RESULTS: The depression PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores reduced by 21.1% or 17.8% in the mindfulness-based intervention group, compared to the control (Z = -2.040, P = 0.041) post 10-week period, suggesting significant reduction in anxiety/stress. These results were consistent with a reduction in systolic BP of 12.24 mm Hg (t = 6.041, P = 0.000). The self-efficacy score of the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to the control (t = 7.818, P < 0.001), while the awareness of physical and mental health in the mindfulness intervention group significantly improved compared to the control (\u03c72 = 5.781, P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based, short-term focused interventions provide modest relief for depression and/or anxiety and are effective in lowering blood pressure and improving self-efficacy scores.

        "abstract": "Many FA who flew prior to the ban on smoking in commercial aircraft exhibit an unusual pattern of long-term pulmonary dysfunction. This randomized controlled study tested the hypothesis that digitally delivered meditative movement (MM) training improves chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related symptoms in flight attendants (FA) who were exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke (SHCS) while flying. Phase I of this two-phase clinical trial was a single-arm non-randomized pilot study that developed and tested methods for MM intervention; we now report on Phase II, a randomized controlled trial comparing MM to a control group of similar FA receiving health education (HE) videos. Primary outcomes were the 6-min walk test and blood levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Pulmonary, cardiovascular, autonomic and affective measures were also taken. There were significant improvements in the 6-min walk test, the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) score, and the COPD Assessment Test. Non-significant trends were observed for increased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels, decreased anxiety scores and reduced blood hs-CRP levels, and increased peak expiratory flow (PEF). In a Survey Monkey questionnaire, 81% of participants who completed pre and post-testing expressed mild to strong positive opinions of the study contents, delivery, or impact, while 16% expressed mild negative opinions. Over the course of the year including the study, participant adoption of the MM practices showed a significant and moderately large correlation with overall health improvement; Pearson's R = 0.62, p < 0.005. These results support the hypothesized benefits of video-based MM training for this population. No adverse effects were reported.

        "title": "Examining psychometric properties of distress tolerance and its moderation of mindfulness-based relapse prevention effects on alcohol and other drug use outcomes.",
        "abstract": "Distress tolerance refers to the degree to which an individual is able to withstand negative psychological and/or physical states. Empirical literature has indicated that lower distress tolerance is associated with a number of negative alcohol and other drug (AOD) use outcomes and psychopathology. Mindfulness meditation focuses on enhancing affect regulation, and may be particularly beneficial for individuals with lower distress tolerance. This secondary analysis evaluated the basic psychometric properties of the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) in a clinical sample of individuals with AOD-use disorders and tested whether distress tolerance for negative psychological states moderated treatment effects on AOD outcomes in an initial efficacy trial of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP). It was hypothesized that participants with lower distress tolerance would report fewer AOD use days over the 4-month follow-up if they received MBRP versus treatment as usual (TAU). Participants (N=168) in the parent RCT were recruited from a private, nonprofit agency providing inpatient and outpatient care for individuals with AOD-use disorders. Assessments of 60-day frequency of AOD use, as measured by the Timeline Followback, were conducted at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 2months and 4months following the intervention. Distress tolerance, as measured by the DTS, was assessed at baseline. Results indicated a one-factor solution, which is consistent with how the DTS has been implemented in other studies. As predicted, DTS was positively associated with all mindfulness subscales, suggesting its convergent validity in this clinical sample. Findings showed the hypothesized time*treatment*distress tolerance interaction, and thereby indicated that participants with lower distress tolerance who received MBRP treatment experienced a greater curvilinear decrease in AOD use days over time than those with lower distress tolerance who received TAU. However, the observed plateau effect suggests that these effects were not maintained at the 4-month follow-up. Findings suggest that distress tolerance is a clinically relevant client characteristic to consider in matching participants to aftercare treatment and that MBRP may be particularly helpful for individuals with lower distress tolerance.",

        "title": "Mindfulness Training Changes Brain Dynamics During Depressive Rumination: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and its prevalence is on the rise. One of the most debilitating aspects of depression is the dominance and persistence of depressive rumination, a state of mind that is linked to onset and recurrence of depression. Mindfulness meditation trains adaptive attention regulation and present-moment embodied awareness, skills that may be particularly useful during depressive mind states characterized by negative ruminative thoughts. METHODS: In a randomized controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study (N = 80), we looked at the neurocognitive mechanisms behind mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (n = 50) for recurrent depression compared with treatment as usual (n = 30) across experimentally induced states of rest, mindfulness practice and rumination, and the relationship with dispositional psychological processes. RESULTS: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with treatment as usual led to decreased salience network connectivity to the lingual gyrus during a ruminative state, and this change in salience network connectivity mediated improvements in the ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings showed that a clinically effective mindfulness intervention modulates neurocognitive functioning during depressive rumination and the ability to sustain attention to the body.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many university students experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. To support their mental health, a transdiagnostic mobile app intervention has been developed. The intervention provides short exercises rooted in various approaches (eg, positive psychology, mindfulness, self-compassion, and acceptance and commitment therapy) that aim to facilitate adaptive emotion regulation (ER) to help students cope with the various stressors they encounter during their time at university. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study are to investigate whether the intervention and its components function as intended and how participants engage with them. In addition, this study aims to monitor changes in distress symptoms and ER skills and identify relevant contextual factors that may moderate the intervention's impact. METHODS: A sequential explanatory mixed methods design combining a microrandomized trial and semistructured interviews will be used. During the microrandomized trial, students (N=200) will be prompted via the mobile app twice a day for 3 weeks to evaluate their emotional states and complete a randomly assigned intervention (ie, an exercise supporting ER) or a control intervention (ie, a health information snippet). A subsample of participants (21/200, 10.5%) will participate in interviews exploring their user experience with the app and the completed exercises. The primary outcomes will be changes in emotional states and engagement with the intervention (ie, objective and subjective engagement). Objective engagement will be evaluated through log data (eg, exercise completion time). Subjective engagement will be evaluated through exercise likability and helpfulness ratings as well as user experience interviews. The secondary outcomes will include the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms). Finally, the contextual moderators of intervention effectiveness will be explored (eg, the time of day and momentary emotional states). RESULTS: The study commenced on February 9, 2023, and the data collection was concluded on June 13, 2023. Of the 172 eligible participants, 161 (93.6%) decided to participate. Of these 161 participants, 137 (85.1%) completed the first phase of the study. A subsample of participants (18/172, 10.5%) participated in the user experience interviews. Currently, the data processing and analyses are being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the functioning of the intervention and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the findings will shed light on potential changes in the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms), which will be considered when designing a follow-up randomized controlled trial evaluating the full-scale effectiveness of this intervention. Finally, the results and data gathered will be used to design and train a recommendation algorithm that will be integrated into the app linking students to relevant content.

        "title": "Coping with stress in medical students: results of a randomized controlled trial using a mindfulness-based stress prevention training (MediMind) in Germany.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High prevalence rates of psychological distress in medical training and later professional life indicate a need for prevention. Different types of intervention were shown to have good effects, but little is known about the relative efficacy of different types of stress management interventions, and methodological limitations have been reported. In order to overcome some of these limitations, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of a specifically developed mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students (MediMind) on measures of distress, coping and psychological morbidity. METHODS: We report on a prospective randomized controlled trial with three study conditions: experimental treatment (MediMind), standard treatment (Autogenic Training) and a control group without treatment. The sample consisted of medical or dental students in the second or eighth semester. They completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, after the training and at one year follow-up. Distress (Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress, TICS) was assessed as the primary outcome and coping (Brief COPE) as a co-primary outcome. Effects on the psychological morbidity (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI) as a secondary outcome were expected one year after the trainings. RESULTS: Initially, N = 183 students were randomly allocated to the study groups. At one year follow-up N = 80 could be included into the per-protocol analysis: MediMind (n =31), Autogenic Training (n = 32) and control group (n = 17). A selective drop-out for students who suffered more often from psychological symptoms was detected (p = .020). MANCOVA's on TICS and Brief COPE revealed no significant interaction effects. On the BSI, a significant overall interaction effect became apparent (p = .002, \u03b72partial = .382), but post hoc analyses were not significant. Means of the Global Severity Index (BSI) indicated that MediMind may contribute to a decrease in psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION: Due to the high and selective dropout rates, the results cannot be generalized and further research is necessary. Since the participation rate of the trainings was high, a need for further prevention programs is indicated. The study gives important suggestions on further implementation and evaluation of stress prevention in medical schools.

Participants completed measures including the World Health Organization Well-Being Index, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The effects of measures in both groups were compared. Parallel process latent growth curve modeling analysis was used to explore the longitudinal moderated mediation effects. The results showed that SAM was effective at improving positive affect, mindfulness, well-being, and reducing negative affect. Mindfulness growth speed during the intervention period mediated the relationship between SAM and positive affect improvement speed. The moderation effects of baseline well-being and negative effect on mediation effects were found to be significant. The SAM program was effective for the general public and was more beneficial for those with medium/high well-being and low/medium negative affect.",

This study explores a mindfulness-based course (MBC) to decrease burnout in a multidisciplinary group of pediatric oncology staff members in the United States and Israel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight participants, mostly nurses, were randomized to either the MBC intervention or a control group. MBC participants received eight weekly sessions of mindfulness education. The primary outcome studied was burnout. Secondary outcomes studied included depression and perceived stress. RESULTS: Nearly 100% of the subjects exhibited signs of burnout at baseline and MBC did not result in any significant improvement in scores on burnout, perceived stress or depression scales. Qualitative analysis of diaries kept by subjects revealed reduced stress, improved inner peace, compassion and joy, better focus and self-awareness and less somatic symptoms in the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout is a major problem in pediatric oncology staff. Mindfulness practices can be taught in the workplace and may be a useful component of a multidimensional strategy to reduce burnout in this population.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recently, research on mindfulness and humor has begun to spark interest, both being essential contributors to well-being. This article proposes that forms of humor that share intention and attitudinal foundations with mindfulness, constitute the foundation of a mindful-humorous perspective and mindful humor. Once intention and attitude are in alignment, shared mechanisms underlying a mindful-humorous perspective may lead to synergetic effects (e.g., reinforcing a shift in perspective and attitudinal foundations) as summarized in the proposed mindful humor filter model (MHFM). Based on this theoretical framework, the humor-enriched mindfulness-based program (HEMBP) was developed and evaluated for validity and efficacy in a randomized controlled trial as a first step to test the newly introduced model. METHODS: A total of 60 participants were randomly allocated to either the HEMBP or a wait-list control group. Participants' mindfulness, comic styles (e.g., benevolent humor, sarcasm, and cynicism), psychological well-being, life satisfaction, stress, and gelotophobia (fear of being laughed at) were assessed 1 week before and after training, and at a 1-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to model changes in outcome variables over time. RESULTS: The HEMBP was effective in increasing mindfulness, benevolent humor, and psychological well-being, and in reducing sarcasm, cynicism, stress, and gelotophobia, compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Results support the validity and efficacy of the HEMBP as a promising approach for improving well-being and reducing stress. The HEMBP broadens the scope of existing mindfulness-based programs by cultivating a mindful-humorous outlook on life, facilitating mindfulness practice and insights, and fostering positive emotions and relationships with others through mindful humor. Results are also suggestive of the validity of the mindful humor filter model.",
