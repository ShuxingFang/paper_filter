            "abstract": "The authors, both anthropologists who study alternative states of consciousness (ASC), explore the psychodynamics of mystical experience (ME). An affect that is a key factor for and integral to the phenomenology of ME is what they term \"mystical love.\" In many respects, ME refers to ASC that is diametrically opposite to everyday ego-centered, materialist consciousness. In this article we examine several questions, including: (1) Why do humans experience ME, (2) why does there seems to be a need to alter consciousness away from ordinary waking states, (3) what is the relationship between mystical love and other affective states such as anger, greed, and anxiety, and (3) what are the necessary conditions for ME-type, transpersonal experiences? We demonstrate that ritual practices are recurrently used across cultures to incubate and evoke intense feelings of non-romantic love, empathy, and compassion. Some of these practices include ritual drivers such as ingesting psychotropic substances (entheogens and empathogens), daily activities that devalue ego centeredness and promote love, empathy and selfless service, meditation upon loving kindness, and compassion. All of these practices are preparations for entering ME, the results of which are interpreted within people's cycle of meaning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade a number of researchers have proposed that therapeutic presence can be fostered through training in mindfulness practices. Most counseling training programs focus on teaching students a set of skills, although the common or contextual factors movement contends that the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the personal characteristics of the therapist are the key determinants of positive therapy outcomes. For the past 10 years we have been teaching mindfulness practices to counseling students in a CACREP-accredited program. Our research suggests that training in practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga, qigong, and body-awareness can help counselors to realize and embody the personal characteristics that foster therapeutic presence. This article provides a detailed description of our mindfulness-based course, proposes recommendations for counseling coursework in mindfulness, and discusses the impact of the course on the ability to cultivate therapeutic presence.

Self-compassion, the capacity to hold one's suffering with kindness and a wish to alleviate it, is associated with improvements in well-being. Veterans have more medical conditions than non-veterans and higher prevalence rates of severe pain. Acceptability of the intervention with veterans is assessed along with the impact of MSC on the physical, mental, and social health of the participants. Methods: A racially diverse, predominantly male group of veterans (n = 80) were assessed pre- and post-MSC group with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to evaluate physical, mental, and social health. Measures of self-compassion, happiness, self-report medication usage, and a global assessment of improvement measure were also included. Qualitative responses to the MSC program were also solicited and reviewed. Results: Engagement with MSC was high (74% completion rate) and 96% of treatment completers rated their participation in the intervention as positive. Completers demonstrated small to medium effect size increases in self-compassion, happiness, and social role satisfaction, 95% CIs (- 6.13, -2.65), (-2.62, -1.06), and (-4.28, -1.05), and decreases in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain interference, 95% CIs (0.44, 4.13), (0.57, 4.84), (0.43, 3.71), and (0.13, 2.70). In exploratory analyses related to pain, veterans taking pain medication reported a significant decrease in use (\u03c72(2, N = 47) = 24.30, p < .001). Conclusions: These results are suggestive of the positive effects of the MSC intervention to veterans, but await a randomized controlled trial to establish its effectiveness in this population.

Loving-kindness meditations (LKMs), a mindfulness practice that involves sending feelings of kindness to oneself, loved ones, and all beings, may increase feelings of self-compassion. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of LKMs on self-compassion in adults. Methods: Peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertations written in English with adult samples, quantitative analysis of a LKM, and measured self-compassion using the Self-Compassion Scale were included in the meta-analysis. Seven articles met inclusion criteria following a systematic search. Results: We found a moderate overall effect of LKMs on self-compassion (g = 0.44, p < 0.0001), indicating LKMs are effective at increasing self-compassion in adults. Conclusions: Self-compassion can be increased in adults using LKMs. Given the role of self-compassion in well-being, future research should test increasing self-compassion as a mechanism of the effect of LKMs on psychological health.

These effects are either explored during meditation practice (state effects) or as a longer-term result of meditation training during the resting-state (trait). The topic of this article is to first review these findings by focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) changes in healthy subjects with or without experience in meditation. Modifications in EEG baseline rhythms, functional connectivity and advanced nonlinear parameters are discussed in regard to feasibility in clinical applications. Secondly, we provide a state-of-the-art of studies that proposed meditative practices as a complementary therapy in patients with epilepsy, in whom anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent. In these studies, the effects of standardized meditation programs including elements of traditional meditation practices such as mindfulness, loving-kindness and compassion are explored both at the level of psychological functioning and on the occurrence of seizures. Lastly, preliminary results are given regarding our ongoing study, the aim of which is to quantify the effects of a mindfulness self-compassion (MSC) practice on interictal and ictal epileptic activity. Feasibility, difficulties, and prospects of this study are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)",

This systematic review examines the effectiveness of organisation-wide interventions in reducing behaviours of concern (BoC) and the use of RPs in people with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Methods 19 electronic databases were searched up to February 2021 for literature, with no language restrictions applied. This systematic review of interventions included any publication aimed at reducing the use of RPs and/or BoC in organisations providing services to people with any NDD. Results A total of 15 studies were included in the review. Seven were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-RCTs. Most studies focussed on workplace education and training. There was evidence that staff training in Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) and mindfulness-based PBS (MBPBS) reduced aggression, the use of chemical and physical restraints, and peer and staff injuries (MBPBS) in the medium term. A multi-component intervention also showed evidence of a reduction in behaviours of concern in the medium and long term. Conclusions A number of studies showed that organisation-wide PBS training, particularly MBPBS training, can reduce BoC and the use of RPs. One multi-component study also substantially reduced BoC. Organisational strategies such as these can improve the rights of people with disability by reducing the use of RPs. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited as all comparisons were single studies which had potential biases. We are also not able to say whether these findings can be generalised to children, and adults with other neurodevelopmental disabilities, as all but one study focused on adults with intellectual disabilities.

            "abstract": "Student mental health and well-being are increasing concerns in higher education. This exploratory study examined students' learning in a mindfulness programme incorporated into an undergraduate class. Six brief mindfulness-based practices were introduced: mindfulness meditation, walking meditation, body scan, mindful eating, loving-kindness and Tonglen meditation. Fourteen students were interviewed after completion of the course to explore their conceptions and use of mindfulness and other self-care practices. Results of thematic analyses suggest that there were variations in students' adoption of mindfulness-based practices and students' preferred mindfulness techniques. Most participants reported that mindfulness instruction and practice were beneficial but this was not universal; some students reported that mindfulness was 'not for them'. Findings suggest that mindfulness fostered self-reflection, self-awareness and relaxation for many students and incorporating mindfulness at the beginning of class improved the overall quality of discussion and facilitated students' learning. Findings further suggest that students incorporated mindfulness into existing self-care practices that included a variety of other preferred techniques to enhance self-reflection, self-awareness and relaxation. Overall, our findings suggest that students should be helped, through explicit instruction, to develop a 'toolbox' of self-care approaches that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, mindfulness techniques.

Well-being interventions may be well-suited to individuals with diabetes, as they are simple to deliver, broadly applicable across a range of psychological distress, and may help increase self-efficacy and motivation for diabetes self-care. This systematic review, completed using PRISMA guidelines, examined peer-reviewed studies indexed in PubMed, PsycINFO, and/or Scopus between database inception and October 2017 that investigated the effects of well-being interventions (e.g., positive psychology interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, resilience-based interventions) on psychological and physical health outcomes in individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The search yielded 34 articles (N = 1635 participants), with substantial variability in intervention type, measures used, and outcomes studied; the majority found the intervention to provide benefit. Overall, results indicate that a range of well-being interventions appear to have promise in improving health outcomes in this population, but the literature does not yet provide definitive data about which specific interventions are most effective. The variability in interventions and outcomes points to a need for further rigorous, controlled, and well-powered studies of specific interventions, with well-accepted, clinically relevant outcome measures.

            "abstract": "Background: Ontological addiction theory (OAT) is a novel metaphysical model of psychopathology and posits that human beings are prone to forming implausible beliefs concerning the way they think they exist, and that these beliefs can become addictive leading to functional impairments and mental illness. The theoretical underpinnings of OAT derive from the Buddhist philosophical perspective that all phenomena, including the self, do not manifest inherently or independently. Aims and methods: This paper outlines the theoretical foundations of OAT along with indicative supportive empirical evidence from studies evaluating meditation awareness training as well as studies investigating non-attachment, emptiness, compassion, and loving-kindness. Results: OAT provides a novel perspective on addiction, the factors that underlie mental illness, and how beliefs concerning selfhood are shaped and reified. Conclusion: In addition to continuing to test the underlying assumptions of OAT, future empirical research needs to determine how ontological addiction fits with extant theories of self, reality, and suffering, as well with more established models of addiction.

            "abstract": "Objectives It is debatable whether loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) effectively reduces anxiety, and previous studies have reported inconsistent findings. This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of LKCM on anxiety. Method Studies that took LKCM as the main body and measured anxiety as an outcome were included. There were no exclusion criteria for sample characteristics or control groups. Results Among 327 empirical studies published up to March 2022 on LKCM, 59 measured anxiety as an outcome. Metaanalyses showed that LKCM interventions are effective in reducing anxiety (d = -0.28, k = 19, n = 1284 for randomized controlled trials; d = -0.48, k = 26, n = 1177 for nonrandomized trials; d = -0.58, k = 6, n = 503 for laboratory experiments). The heterogeneity was high between studies. Subgroup analyses for randomized controlled trials found that studies combining loving-kindness meditation and mindfulness meditation outperformed studies adopting loving-kindness meditation alone. Moreover, studies with waitlist controls had greater effect sizes than studies with active controls. The type of anxiety, participant characteristics, protocol, or length of intervention had no statistically significant moderating effects. Individual studies supported mindfulness and self-compassion as important mechanisms, but the amount of meditation practice made a limited contribution. Conclusions LKCM interventions can be effective in reducing anxiety. The incremental value of combining mindfulness meditation with loving-kindness meditation is encouraging. More research is needed, especially on specific populations suffering from anxiety disorders. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Although many positive psychology interventions like mindfulness-based treatments (MBTs) for youth have been used with a wide array of risk exposed populations (children living in poverty, victims of violence, displaced persons, children with disabilities, etc.), the efficacy of MBTs with regard to the level and domain of risk exposure has been largely overlooked. This oversight contributes to a perception of positive psychology as being decontextualized. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to better understand how a young person's level and domain of risk exposure influences the efficacy of MBTs. Published studies were included if participants were children or adolescents, were RCTs or cluster RCTs, and focused on the effect of an MBT or an MBT component. Specifically, 58 studies were qualitatively analyzed and 42 were quantitatively analyzed. The qualitative analysis evidenced a lack of objectivity in the assessment of risk exposure, with many papers providing very little or no detail on participants' level or domain of risk exposure (whether threats to psychological wellbeing originate with the individual's biology or cognitions, or the social, built or natural environment). Our quantitative analysis showed that MBTs significantly improved main outcomes relative to the control conditions, with a small-to-moderate effect size. Where it was possible to identify the level of risk exposure, we found that MBTs positively moderated treatment response, with better response among those participants with a higher level of risk. We conclude that future Positive Psychology research will need to better account for risk exposure if the discipline is to improve our understanding of which populations benefit most from interventions that promote mindfulness.

Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) is a traditional meditation practice directly oriented toward enhancing unconditional and positive emotional states of kindness towards oneself and others. We report here two independent and uncontrolled studies carried out at different centers, one in Boston, USA (n = 10), and one in Frankfurt, Germany (n = 8), to examine the potential therapeutic utility of a brief LKM group intervention for symptoms of dysthymia and depression. Results at both centers suggest that LKM was associated with large-sized effects on self-reported symptoms of depression (d = 3.33 and 1.90), negative affect (d = 1.98 and 0.92), and positive affect (d = 1.63 and 0.94). Large effects were also found for clinician-reported changes in depression, rumination and specific positive emotions, and moderate effects for changes in adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The qualitative data analyses provide additional support for the potential clinical utility of the intervention. This proof-of-concept evaluation of LKM as a clinical strategy warrants further investigation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Specifically, we compared the behavior of caregivers and clients before and after MBPBS training for the caregivers in terms of caregiver-client engagement, percent of learning and leisure interactions during caregiver-client engagement, and percent of the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors during learning and leisure interactions. In addition, we examined the effects of specific conditionality of attentional responses of the caregivers to the clients' challenging or socially acceptable behavior in terms of frequency, latency, duration, and quality.MethodCaregiver and client engagements were videotaped before and after MBPBS training for the caregivers. The percent of caregiver-client engagement was analyzed using partial-interval recording for overall engagement and the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors during learning and leisure interactions. The effects of the caregivers' attentional responses to the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors were analyzed using whole-interval recording.ResultsTraining caregivers in MBPBS significantly increased caregiver-client engagement during learning and leisure activities, which resulted in the clients exhibiting fewer challenging behaviors and more socially appropriate behaviors. Furthermore, an analysis of the effects of different types of caregiver attention showed differential effects on the clients' challenging behaviors and socially acceptable behaviors.ConclusionsThe results indicated that behavior analytic methods can be used as an objective and reliable way of capturing the nature of changes in predefined behaviors of both caregivers and clients at a moment-by-moment level following training of the caregivers in a mindfulness-based program. Using such an analytic method may provide an effective way of objectively measuring some experiential processes involved in mindfulness training.

Overcoming negative interpersonal attitudes is a key subject in loving-kindness and compassion meditations (LCMs). However, the results and study design of previous research on negative interpersonal attitudes have been inconsistent. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the effects of LCMs and explore moderators through meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Core Collection, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and PsycINFO databases up to April 2, 2021. Of the 281 identified empirical studies on LCMs, 25 measured negative interpersonal attitudes, and 21 were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the effects of LCMs on negative interpersonal attitudes in daily life were significant both for randomized controlled trials (g = -.203) and uncontrolled trials (g = -.539). The instant effects after meditation were also significant in randomized controlled experiments (g = -.187). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis and nonsignificant subgroup analysis showed that the results were robust except for randomized controlled experiments. Although no significant moderators were identified, moderator analysis suggested that reducing bias and sending wishes to difficult targets were especially effective, and LCM subtypes might impact the results. Individual studies found that the contribution of meditation practice during interventions was weak. In sum, LCMs have the potential to reduce negative interpersonal attitudes, especially in multiweek interventions. Future studies should further explore the underlying mechanisms and consider the implications of study design features, such as the induction of negative interpersonal attitudes and the targets of LCMs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

Utilizing a single-participant design, this study conducted the first clinical evaluation of a novel and integrated non-pharmacological treatment for a participant with dual-diagnosis schizophrenia and pathological gambling. The participant underwent a 20-week treatment course comprising: (i) an initial phase of second-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and (ii) a subsequent phase employing a meditation-based recovery model (involving the administering of an intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training). The primary outcome was diagnostic change (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) for schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Secondary outcomes were: (i) psychiatric symptom severity, (ii) pathological gambling symptom severity, (iii) psychosocial functioning, and (iv) dispositional mindfulness. Findings demonstrated that the participant was successfully treated for both schizophrenia and pathological gambling. Significant improvements were also observed across all other outcome variables and positive outcomes were maintained at 3-month follow-up. An initial phase of CBT to improve social coping skills and environmental mastery, followed by a phase of meditation-based therapy to increase perceptual distance from mental urges and intrusive thoughts, may be a diagnostically-syntonic treatment for co-occurring schizophrenia and pathological gambling.

Potential solutions to such challenges are then explored. These include practices such as enhanced thought experiments, interviews, research projects, in-depth role-playing, action projects, and appropriately morally deferential experiential service-learning. Moral imagination can be beneficially stretched through adopting differing moral lenses and engaging and encouraging multiple empathizing; art and literary narrative provide helpful tools to this end. Also recommended is critical scrutiny focused on personal biases (including teacher bias) and developing curriculum focused on moral literacy. Such moves of necessity span from individual to public action given the environmental components of the operations of bias. Shaping ourselves through intentional environment construction and avoidance of undesirable environments is therefore identified as a valuable technique. Finally, the potential contribution of loving-kindness meditation is addressed.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-91067-001[/rid]). Objectives: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve subjective well-being (SWB), including evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of quality of life (QOL) of working population. Methods: A literature search was conducted, using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. Eligible studies included those that were RCTs of any intervention, conducted among healthy workers, measured SWB as a primary outcome, and original articles in English. Study characteristics, intervention, outcomes, and results on SWB outcomes were extracted by the investigators independently. After a brief narrative summarizing and classifying the contents of the interventions, the included outcomes were categorized into each aspect of SWB (evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of QOL). Finally, the characteristics of the effective interventions for increasing each aspect were summarized, and the pooled effect of interventions on SWB was investigated by a meta-analysis. Publication bias was investigated by drawing a funnel plot and conducting Egger's test. Results: From the 5,450 articles found, 39 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The interventions included in this review were classified into six categories (physical activity, ergonomics, psychological, environmental, multicomponent intervention, and others). The meta-analysis from 31 studies showed that the pooled effect of included interventions on SWB was significantly positive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.51; standard error (SE) = 0.10). A funnel plot showed there were extremely large or small SMDs, and Egger's test was significant. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analysis, excluding these extreme SMDs, and confirmed that the estimated pooled effect was also significantly positive. Subgroup analyses for separate types of interventions showed the effects of psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) were also significantly positive. Conclusion: The current study revealed the effectiveness of interventions for increasing SWB. Specifically, psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) may be useful for improving SWB.

            "abstract": "Abstract: Mindfulness-based meditation interventions have become increasingly popular in contemporary psychology. Other closely related meditation practices include loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and compassion meditation (CM), exercises oriented toward enhancing unconditional, positive emotional states of kindness and compassion. This article provides a review of the background, the techniques, and the empirical contemporary literature of LKM and CM. The literature suggests that LKM and CM are associated with an increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect. Preliminary findings from neuroendocrine studies indicate that CM may reduce stress-induced subjective distress and immune response. Neuroimaging studies suggest that LKM and CM may enhance activation of brain areas that are involved in emotional processing and empathy. Finally, preliminary intervention studies support application of these strategies in clinical populations. It is concluded that, when combined with empirically supported treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, LKM and CM may provide potentially useful strategies for targeting a variety of different psychological problems that involve interpersonal processes, such as depression, social anxiety, marital conflict, anger, and coping with the strains of long-term caregiving.

            "abstract": "Consistent with its growing popularity amongst the general public and medical community, throughout recent decades there have been increasing attempts to understand the mechanisms that underlie therapeutic improvement in individuals receiving mindfulness training. The current paper draws upon findings from various remits of scientific enquiry and summarises key evidence-based mechanisms of mindfulness that have been proposed in the academic literature to date. Empirical findings indicate that mindfulness targets biological, psychological, social, and spiritual psychopathology determinants. Furthermore, the mechanistic pathways exploited by mindfulness are likely to vary according to factors such as (i) the type of mindfulness-based intervention that is administered (e.g., first- or second-generation mindfulness-based interventions), (ii) the specific clinical disorder that is being targeted, (iii) the educational, social, and spiritual history of the participant, and (iv) the extent to which the mindfulness instructor truly embodies the principles of mindful living. It is hoped that the mechanisms of mindfulness discussed in this paper will contribute to the formulation of a more complete picture that can be tested and expanded upon during future scientific enquiry.

The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between classic psychedelic experiences and engagement with two popular types of meditation: mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness or compassion meditation. Method This retrospective, population-based observational study included 2822 respondents aged 18 years or older in the United States. Using covariate-adjusted regression models, this study examined associations of classic psychedelic experiences with current practice of mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness or compassion meditation. Results In covariate-adjusted regression models, lifetime classic psychedelic use was associated with a higher frequency of current mindfulness meditation practice but not current loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice. Both psychological insight and 'ego dissolution' were associated with a higher frequency of current mindfulness meditation practice and current loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice. Notably, when psychological insight and 'ego dissolution' were entered into the regression model simultaneously, only greater psychological insight was associated with having a higher frequency of current mindfulness meditation practice and current loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice. Conclusions Although the findings in this study cannot demonstrate causality, they suggest that classic psychedelic experiences may exert a positive effect on the cultivation and maintenance of health-related behaviors such as regular meditation practice, with psychological insight appearing to be a stronger predictor than 'ego dissolution.'

            "abstract": "Background: The steady increase in the number of people living and dying with dementia, coupled with the recent focus on quality of care, has highlighted the importance of dementia training for health care professionals. This exploratory study aimed to discover which skills health care students felt were important in providing quality end-of-life care to dementia patients. Methods: Ninety-four medicine, nursing, and pharmacy students participated in a larger study using open-ended and closed questions to explore attitudes related to caring for dementia patients at the end of life. This study looks at the student responses to an open-ended question regarding the skills and knowledge they believe are needed to provide end-of-life care to dementia patients. Individual responses were reviewed by the researchers, coded into key issues, and tabulated for frequency of occurrences and group differences. Results: Several common issues emerged: knowledge, patience, empathy, understanding, family involvement, compassion, medication knowledge, respect/patient autonomy, communication, quality of life, and patient education. Significant differences were observed among the participant groups on the following issues: Patience and understanding (pharmacy students mentioned these issues less frequently than medical and nursing students), compassion (medical students mentioned this issue more frequently than pharmacy students), and medication knowledge (pharmacy students mentioned this issue more frequently than medical and nursing students). Conclusions: Different health care disciplines (in-training) value different skill sets for the provision of dementia care at the end-of-life. As health care education for dementia patients at the end of life is expanded, it will be important to understand which skills both patients and health care students value. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "abstract": "Objective: Kindness-based meditation (KBM) is a rubric covering meditation techniques developed to elicit kindness in a conscious way. Some techniques, for example, loving-kindness meditation and compassion meditation, have been included in programs aimed at improving health and well-being. Our aim was to systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of KBM on health and well-being against passive and active control groups in patients and the general population. Method: Searches were completed in March 2013. Two reviewers applied predetermined eligibility criteria (RCTs, peer-reviewed publications, theses or conference proceedings, adult participants, KBM interventions) and extracted the data. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Results: Twenty-two studies were included. KBM was moderately effective in decreasing self-reported depression (standard mean difference [Hedges's g] = -0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.08, -0.14]) and increasing mindfulness (Hedges's g = 0.63, 95% CI [0.22, 1.05]), compassion (Hedges's g = 0.61, 95% CI [0.24,0.99]) and self-compassion (Hedges's g = 0.45,95% CI [0.15, 0.75]) against passive controls. Positive emotions were increased (Hedges's g = 0.42, 95% CI [0.10, 0.75]) against progressive relaxation. Exposure to KBM may initially be challenging for some people. Results were inconclusive for some outcomes, in particular against active controls. The methodological quality of the reports was low to moderate. Results suffered from imprecision due to wide CIs deriving from small studies. Conclusions: KBM showed evidence of benefits for the health of individuals and communities through its effects on well-being and social interaction. Further research including well-conducted large RCTs is warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Zhiyi (\u667a\u9857), a representative figure of Chinese Buddhism, proposed a different meditation method, namely, imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation. The current article introduces the imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation proposed by Zhiyi and compares it with meditation methods from Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism. Zhiyi's method limits the content of imagination during meditation, which can be an essential supplement to the free association method derived from Theravada Buddhism. Zhiyi's method of helping others entirely through imagination differs significantly from the tonglen method derived from Tibetan Buddhism and may be more suitable for participants without religious beliefs. Based on Zhiyi's source text and previous psychological studies, a mental-health training program for imagination-based loving-kindness and compassion meditation is proposed. The limitations of Zhiyi's method and the future directions for empirical research on Zhiyi's method are also discussed. The differences between Zhiyi's method and other methods in terms of effects and applicable populations need to be examined in future studies.

            "abstract": "Objectives: While there is a growing understanding of the relationship between mindfulness and compassion, this largely relates to the form of mindfulness employed in first-generation mindfulness-based interventions such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Consequently, there is limited knowledge of the relationship between mindfulness and compassion in respect of the type of mindfulness employed in second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs), including those that employ the principle of working harmoniously as a 'secular sangha.' Understanding this relationship is important because research indicates that perceived emotional synchrony (PES) and shared flow-that often arise during participation in harmonized group contemplative activities-can enhance outcomes relating to compassion, subjective well-being, and group identity fusion. This pilot study analyzed the effects of participation in a mindful-dancing SG-MBI on compassion and investigated the mediating role of shared flow and PES. Methods: A total of 130 participants were enrolled into the study that followed a quasi-experimental design with an intervention and control group. Results: Results confirmed the salutary effect of participating in a collective mindful-dancing program, and demonstrated that shared flow and PES fully meditated the effects of collective mindfulness on the kindness and common humanity dimensions of compassion. Conclusions: Further research is warranted to explore whether collective mindfulness approaches, such as mindful dancing, may be a means of enhancing compassion and subjective well-being outcomes due to the mediating role of PES and shared flow.

This paper reviews current directions, proposes conceptual applications, and discusses integration issues relating to the utilisation of BDIs as problem gambling treatments. Method:A literature search and evaluation of the empirical literature for BDIs as problem gambling treatments was undertaken. Results: To date, research has been limited to cross-sectional studies and clinical case studies and findings indicate that Buddhist-derived mindfulness practices have the potential to play an important role in ameliorating problem gambling symptomatology. As an adjunct to mindfulness, other Buddhist-derived practices are also of interest including: (i) insight meditation techniques (e.g., meditation on 'emptiness') to overcome avoidance and dissociation strategies, (ii) 'antidotes' (e.g., patience, impermanence, etc.) to attenuate impulsivity and salience- related issues, (iii) loving-kindness and compassion meditation to foster positive thinking and reduce conflict, and (iv) 'middle-way' principles and 'bliss-substitution' to reduce relapse and temper withdrawal symptoms. In addition to an absence of controlled treatment studies, the successful operationalisation of BDIs as effective treatments for problem gambling may be impeded by issues such as a deficiency of suitably experienced BDI clinicians, and the poor provision by service providers of both BDIs and dedicated gambling interventions. Conclusions: Preliminary findings for BDIs as problem gambling treatments are promising, however, further research is required. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The meta-experience of emotions implies that there are primary and secondary emotions (i.e., emotions about emotions), similar to the concept of meta-cognitions. Primary and secondary emotions are closely associated with one's cultural background and happiness. Most scholars throughout history believe that happiness per se cannot be taught. However, it is possible to teach practices that lead to the path towards happiness. Promising strategies include loving-kindness and compassion meditation. These strategies are based on Buddhist teachings, which are deeply rooted in a collectivistic culture. This illustrates the close association among emotions, approaches towards happiness, and cultural background. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "abstract": "It is well-accepted that occupational hazards are endemic to the profession of psychology and that psychologists bring both strengths and vulnerabilities to their choice of career. Given the pressures faced by psychologists in contemporary society, how can we most effectively meet our ethical obligation to maintain competence throughout our professional life span in order to provide high quality care to those we serve? In this article, we propose to expand the current conceptualization of psychologist functioning as embodied in the widely promulgated stress-distress continuum. Through the incorporation of a positive dimension, we can envision the potential for psychologists to spiral up via their practice of enhanced self-care. Four foundational principles are interwoven throughout our consideration of effective self-care for psychologists: an emphasis on flourishing (rather than merely surviving), intentionality, an awareness of reciprocity in care of self and others and the benefits of integrating self-care into our daily practices and routines, rather than being added onto existing personal and professional obligations. A review of the literature on psychologist self-care strategies, healthy lifestyles, mindfulness, acceptance-based therapies, and positive psychology informs our endorsement of mindfulness-based positive principles and practice (MPPP's) for psychologists. These MPPP's are broadly conceptualized as the how of effective self-care that supports the what (as in what to do) in this realm. Finally, we envision a future in which effective self-care embedded in MPPP's is truly valued, supported and promoted by the profession in a manner that complements and sustains our ongoing well-being and professional competence.

            "abstract": "Abstract: This review integrates Fredrickson''s broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions with advances in affective neuroscience regarding plasticity in the neural circuitry of emotions to inform the treatment of emotion deficits within psychopathology. We first present a body of research showing that positive emotions broaden cognition and behavioral repertoires, and in so doing, build durable biopsychosocial resources that support coping and flourishing mental health. Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive-emotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typified by emotional dysfunctions.

Effects increased in magnitude when including available follow-up data but did not differ between type of sample, MBI, biomarker, and control group or duration of the MBI. This suggests that MBIs may ameliorate biomarker levels in both psychiatric and subclinical populations to a small extent. However, low study quality and evidence of publication bias may have impacted on the results. More large and preregistered studies are still needed in this field of research.",

            "abstract": "AIM: The primary aim of this study was to conduct an open pilot clinical trial of a brief mindfulness-based intervention for persistent postconcussion symptoms that occur after mild traumatic brain injury in military service members. For many service members, operational tempo and other time constraints may prevent them from completing a standard mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Thus, this study sought to examine the effectiveness of a five-session intervention called mindfulness-based stress, pain, emotion, and attention regulation (MSPEAR). METHODS: Participants were active duty service members with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and persisting postconcussion symptoms, all of whom were recruited from an outpatient TBI rehabilitation program at a military treatment facility. Of the 38 service members that were initially enrolled, 25 completed the 5-session MSPEAR intervention, and 20 returned for a 5-week follow-up evaluation. Questionnaires assessing perceived stress, positive affect, pain interference and catastrophizing, sleep disturbances, perceived behavioral and attention regulation, self-efficacy and satisfaction with life were administered at preintervention, postintervention, and at 5-week follow-up intervals. Neuropsychological testing at preintervention and 5-week follow-up included performance validity measures, attention, working memory, and executive function measures. T-tests were run to compare for questionnaire measures at preintervention (Time 1) to postintervention (Time 2). Repeated analysis of variances were conducted to compare questionnaire and neuropsychological measures at Time 1, Time 2, and at Time 3 which is the 5-week follow-up. RESULTS: Improvements in perceived stress, positive affect, behavioral regulation, metacognition, sleep disturbance, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life were found immediately after the MSPEAR intervention and were maintained at the 5-week follow-up. Magnification and helplessness aspects of pain catastrophizing improved when comparing preintervention to the 5-week follow-up. Pain interference was not significantly different across study assessment times. Neuropsychological testing revealed improvements in sustained attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control when comparing preintervention to the 5-week follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The MSPEAR intervention appears to show promise as a brief and effective therapy for specific postconcussion symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury in military service members. Each of the components of MSPEAR including stress, pain catastrophizing, emotion and attention regulation showed improvements in this study, and bears further investigation in a larger scale, preferably randomized controlled trial in those active duty military service members who experience persisting symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With demographic change, the number of elderly people is increasing. The aging process and associated stress diminishes their quality of life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been claimed to reduce stress and alleviate suffering. It might be a useful approach to improve the condition in the elderly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine feasibility and potential effects of MBSR on nursing home residents in Germany, a non-randomized feasibility study was conducted including 22 participants; 15 of them participated in an 8-week MBSR course, 7 served as untreated comparison group. Health-related quality of life (SF-12), depressive symptoms (GDS-12R), cognitive impairment (MMST), activities of daily living (Barthel Index), satisfaction with life, physical pain and major complaints were assessed pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: 9 out of 15 course participants completed the course (60%). They showed a significant increase in the SF-12 physical health score (p = 0.017). Depressive symptoms (GDS-12R) significantly declined within the meditation group (p = 0.04) and as compared to the untreated group (p = 0.011). In the comparison group, a significant decrease in major complaints (p = 0.011) and an increase in the SF-12 mental health score were found. The meditation group yielded positive changes in the SF-12 mental health score, in satisfaction with life and in pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the setting, the completion rate of 60% appears to be acceptable. Significant results suggest that MBSR may help improve health-related quality of life and reduce symptoms of depression. Yet, as participants did not meet the requirement to practice independently, feasibility of conducting MBSR with elderly who live in a nursing home has to be questioned.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Health care professionals report a lack of skills in the psychosocial and spiritual aspects of caring for dying people and high levels of moral distress, grief, and burnout. To address these concerns, the \"Being with Dying: Professional Training Program in Contemplative End-of-Life Care\" (BWD) was created. The premise of BWD, which is based on the development of mindfulness and receptive attention through contemplative practice, is that cultivating stability of mind and emotions enables clinicians to respond to others and themselves with compassion. This article describes the impact of BWD on the participants. METHODS: Ninety-five BWD participants completed an anonymous online survey; 40 completed a confidential open-ended telephone interview. RESULTS: Four main themes-the power of presence, cultivating balanced compassion, recognizing grief, and the importance of self-care-emerged in the interviews and were supported in the survey data. The interviewees considered BWD's contemplative and reflective practices meaningful, useful, and valuable and reported that BWD provided skills, attitudes, behaviors, and tools to change how they worked with the dying and bereaved. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The quality of presence has the potential to transform the care of dying people and the caregivers themselves. Cultivating this quality within themselves and others allows clinicians to explore alternatives to exclusively intellectual, procedural, and task-oriented approaches when caring for dying people. BWD provides a rare opportunity to engage in practices and methods that cultivate the stability of mind and emotions that may facilitate compassionate care of dying patients, families, and caregivers.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Washing hands helps prevent transmission of seasonal and pandemic respiratory viruses. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) during the swine flu outbreak, participants with access to a fully automated, digital intervention promoting handwashing reported washing their hands more often and experienced fewer respiratory tract infections than those without access to the intervention. Based on these findings, the intervention was adapted, renamed as \"Germ Defence,\" and a study was designed to assess the preliminary dissemination of the intervention to the general public to help prevent the spread of seasonal colds and flu. OBJECTIVE: This study compares the process evaluations of the RCT and Germ Defence dissemination to examine (1) how web-based research enrollment procedures affected those who used the intervention, (2) intervention usage in the 2 contexts, and (3) whether increased intentions to wash hands are replicated once disseminated. METHODS: The RCT ran between 2010 and 2012 recruiting participants offline from general practices, with restricted access to the intervention (N=9155). Germ Defence was disseminated as an open access website for use by the general public from 2016 to 2019 (N=624). The process evaluation plan was developed using Medical Research Council guidance and the framework for Analyzing and Measuring Usage and Engagement Data. Both interventions contained a goal-setting section where users self-reported current and intended handwashing behavior across 7 situations. RESULTS: During web-based enrolment, 54.3% (17,511/32,250) of the RCT participants dropped out of the study compared to 36.5% (358/982) of Germ Defence users. Having reached the start of the intervention, 93.8% (8586/9155) of RCT users completed the core section, whereas 65.1% (406/624) of Germ Defence users reached the same point. Users across both studies selected to increase their handwashing in 5 out of 7 situations, including before eating snacks (RCT mean difference 1.040, 95% CI 1.016-1.063; Germ Defence mean difference 0.949, 95% CI 0.766-1.132) and after blowing their nose, sneezing, or coughing (RCT mean difference 0.995, 95% CI 0.972-1.019; Germ Defence mean difference 0.842, 95% CI 0.675-1.008). CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the preliminary dissemination of Germ Defence to the RCT, we were able to examine the potential effects of the research procedures on uptake and attrition such as the sizeable dropout during the RCT enrolment procedure that may have led to a more motivated sample. The Germ Defence study highlighted the points of attrition within the intervention. Despite sample bias in the trial context, the intervention replicated increases in intentions to handwash when used \"in the wild.\" This preliminary dissemination study informed the adaptation of the intervention for the COVID-19 health emergency, and it has now been disseminated globally.

We assessed whether these treatment modalities have shown usefulness in adolescents with T2D or at risk for T2D. RECENT FINDINGS: Data are limited on the use of the abovementioned therapeutic interventions and include only adolescent girls at risk for T2D. CBT was as useful as health education sessions. At 1 year, greater decreases in depression, insulin resistance, and BMI were observed in girls randomized to mindfulness compared with CBT groups. Given the positive outcome of mindfulness intervention in adults and in adolescent girls at risk for T2D, future studies should involve males at risk for T2D, and adolescents diagnosed with T2D. Longer interventions and booster meetings for maintenance should be studied.",

DESIGN: We conducted a post-hoc reanalysis of longitudinal data (N = 107) derived from a RCT of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder to model the core constructs of the MMT (attentional control, decentering, broadened awareness, reappraisal, and positive affect) in a multivariate path analysis. RESULTS: Findings indicated that increases in attentional control from baseline to post-training predicted increases in decentering by 3 months post-treatment (p<.01) that in turn predicted increases in broadened awareness of interoceptive and exteroceptive data by 6 months post-treatment (p<.001). In turn, broadened awareness predicted increases in the use of reappraisal by 9 months post-treatment (p<.01), which culminated in greater positive affect at 12 months post-treatment (p<.001). MBSR led to significantly greater increases in decentering (p<.05) and broadened awareness than CBT (p<.05). Significant indirect effects indicated that increases in decentering mediated the effect of mindfulness training on broadening awareness, which in turn mediated enhanced reappraisal efficacy. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the mechanisms of change identified by the MMT form an iterative chain that promotes long-term increases in positive affectivity. Though these mechanisms may reflect common therapeutic factors that cut across mindfulness-based and cognitive-behavioral interventions, MBSR specifically boosts the MMT cycle by producing significantly greater increases in decentering and broadened awareness than CBT, providing support for the foundational assumption in the MMT that mindfulness training may be a key means of stimulating downstream positive psychological processes.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripartum depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and are correlated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Antenatal care in Germany does not yet include structured screening and effective low-threshold treatment options for women facing peripartum depression and anxiety disorders. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly becoming a focus of interest for the management of such patients. Studies have shown a decrease in pregnancy-related stress and anxiety in expectant mothers following mindfulness programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical effectiveness of a 1-week electronic course of mindfulness on prenatal depression and anxiety in hospitalized, high-risk pregnant women. We hypothesized that participating in a 1-week electronic MBI (eMBI) could alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety during the hospital stay. METHODS: A prospective pilot study with an explorative study design was conducted from January to May 2019 in a sample of 68 women hospitalized due to high-risk pregnancies. After enrolling into the study, the participants were given access to an eMBI app on how to deal with stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. Psychometric parameters were assessed via electronic questionnaires comprising the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), and abridged version of the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R). RESULTS: We observed a high prevalence of peripartum depression and anxiety among hospitalized high-risk pregnant women: 39% (26/67) of the study participants in the first assessment and 41% (16/39) of the participants in the second assessment achieved EPDS scores above the cutoff value for minor/major depression. The number of participants with anxiety levels above the cutoff value (66% [45/68] of the participants in the first assessment and 67% [26/39] of the participants in the second assessment) was significantly more than that of the participants with anxiety levels below the cutoff value, as measured with the STAI-S. After completing the 1-week electronic course on mindfulness, the participants showed a significant reduction in the mean state anxiety levels (P<.03). Regarding pregnancy-related anxiety, participants who completed more than 50% of the 1-week course showed lower scores in PRAQ-R in the second assessment (P<.05). No significant changes in the EPDS scores were found after completing the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Peripartum anxiety and depression represent a relevant health issue in hospitalized pregnant patients. Short-term eMBIs could have the potential to reduce anxiety levels and pregnancy-related anxiety. However, we observed that compliance to eMBI seems to be related to lower symptoms of pregnancy-related stress among high-risk patients. eMBIs represent accessible mental health resources at reduced costs and can be adapted for hospitalized patients during pregnancy.",

Six articles met the inclusion criteria (one cross-sectional study, one study with pre-post measurements, two cohort studies and two RCT studies). Mindfulness-related interventions promoted parasympathetic activity, an increased vagal tone and improvements in PTSD and OCD symptoms.

            "abstract": "STUDY QUESTION: Can we develop a preconception lifestyle programme for couples undergoing IVF that is in line with their needs. SUMMARY ANSWER: A mobile preconception lifestyle programme was systematically developed based on expert opinion, literature and needs of IVF-patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A healthy lifestyle prior to conception is not only beneficial for the general health of couples, but evidence on its importance for their reproductive health and the health of their children is also emerging. So far, the vast majority of fertility clinics do not offer a lifestyle programme for couples undergoing IVF. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a lifestyle programme for IVF-couples. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The development of the PreLiFe-programme was guided by the steps of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing complex interventions, a systematic approach for developing theory- and evidence-based health promotion interventions. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: First, the evidence base on lifestyle programmes for IVF-couples was reviewed. Second, several iterations between an expert panel, the literature, and quantitative and qualitative data from IVF-patients identified the content, the format, behaviour change techniques and theory of the programme. Third, the PreLiFe-programme was produced and the expected process and outcomes of a randomized controlled trial assessing it were modelled. Finally, user tests among experts and patients and pilot tests among patients were conducted. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: The finally developed PreLiFe-programme is a mobile application to be used autonomously by both partners of IVF-couples during the first year of IVF, in combination with motivational interviewing over the telephone every three months (i.e. blended care). The PreLiFe-programme provides advice and skills training on physical activity, diet and mindfulness based stress reduction and is in part tailored based on monitoring and tracking the lifestyle of patients. Based on the literature the expert panel considers it plausible that all three components contribute to IVF-success rates. The PreLiFe-programme is likely to be acceptable to patients as it meets the need of patients for lifestyle advice and treatment information. LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: The pilot in IVF-couples had a 3-month duration. The feasibility of the PreLiFe-programme in other infertile populations and/or upon longer use is yet to be examined. Whether the PreLiFe-programme effectively improves lifestyle and IVF-success rates is currently being examined in a trial randomizing heterosexual couples starting IVF to the PreLiFe-programme or an attention-control group for 12 months. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: If the PreLiFe-programme improves lifestyle and the chance of IVF-success, it will be a powerful tool and provide guidance for implementing lifestyle programmes in fertility clinics.

Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been used to improve empathy in healthy populations, its therapeutic efficacy remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of MBIs on empathy in a healthy population and the potential factors affecting the efficacy of MBIs. The literature search focused on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CNKI from inception to September 2022. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies reporting the effects of using MBIs on empathy in healthy populations were included. A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Results of the meta-analysis showed that MBIs improved empathy (SMD, 0.372, 95% CI, 0.164-0.579, p = 0.001) in the healthy population compared with that in the control group. Moreover, results of the subgroup analysis showed that intervention dose (over 24 h vs. under 24 h), format (online vs. offline), and types (different types) were important factors affecting treatment outcomes. This comprehensive review suggests that MBIs are effective treatment for empathy in healthy population. Future research should markedly focus on large-sample, rigorously designed experiments to explore the long-term effects of MBIs on empathy and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MBIs. This study provides a reference for the daily application of MBIs.",

We report on a two-part study to adapt MHB by incorporating mindfulness skills, using mobile health technology to monitor and reinforce behaviors, and delivering it via live video. METHODS: Participants were older adults (age \u2265 60) with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and at least one lifestyle risk factor. In Aim 1 (n = 11, 2 groups), we conducted focus groups to obtain qualitative feedback on proposed adaptations. In Aim 2 (n = 10), we conducted a virtual open pilot with exit interviews to explore the feasibility and outcomes of the adapted MHB. RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed: (1) barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyles, (2) positive impressions of MHB, (3) interest in mindfulness skills, and (4) openness to study technologies. MHB met a-priori feasibility benchmarks and was associated with improvements in cognition, lifestyle (e.g. physical function), and proposed mechanisms (e.g. mindfulness). Exit interviews confirmed high feasibility and satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The integration of mindfulness, live video, and mobile health technologies was feasible and promising for improving healthier lifestyles.

Nevertheless, few empirical studies have touched on how mindfulness training (MT) influences altruistic behaviour under high- and low-cost situations in a real-life scenario. The present study aimed to examine the effect of mindfulness training on altruistic willingness at different cost levels. A total of 41 females participated in our study and were randomly assigned to the MT and control groups. They completed the empathy-altruism task and Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) before and after an 8-week experimental intervention, during which the MT group attended the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programme, while the control group remained as usual. The MT group presented a significant increase in overall FFMQ scores after the 8 weeks of MBCT. However, their willingness to help declined in the low-cost situation at post-test. Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between the increase in the scores of the observing facet and willingness to help in the high-cost situation in the MT group. The changes in describing facet were a negative predictor of the change in empathy in the low-cost situation. Taken together, 8-week MBCT enhanced the level of mindfulness but reduced people's willingness to help in the low-cost situation.",

            "title": "Mindfulness-Based Mobile Health to Address Unhealthy Eating Among Middle-Aged Sexual Minority Women With Early Life Adversity: Mixed Methods Feasibility Trial.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sexual minority women (lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer, and other nonheterosexual women) remain considerably underrepresented in health research despite being at a higher risk for diabetes and obesity as well as stigma and psychological distress than their heterosexual peers. In addition, early life adversity (ELA) is prevalent among sexual minority women, which further increases risks for obesity, psychological distress, and poor cardiovascular health. App-based mindfulness interventions are potentially promising for this group in mitigating the adverse health effects of ELA, reducing food craving and unhealthy eating, addressing the risks associated with obesity. OBJECTIVE: This mixed methods feasibility trial aimed to test a mindfulness-based mobile health approach for middle-aged sexual minority women (aged 30-55 years) with ELA and overweight or obesity (BMI \u226525 kg/m(2)) to improve health outcomes. METHODS: The single-arm trial was advertised on social media and various lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer web-based groups. At baseline, after the intervention (2 months), and at the 4-month follow-up, participants completed assessments of primary outcomes (food craving, emotional eating, and weight via a mailed scale) and secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and emotion dysregulation). A standardized weight measure was mailed to participants for weight reporting. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed after the intervention via surveys and semistructured exit interviews. RESULTS: We screened 442 individuals, among which 30 eligible sexual minority women (mean age 40.20, SD 7.15 years) from various US regions were enrolled in the study. At baseline, 86% (26/30) and 80% (24/30) of participants had elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Among the 30 enrolled participants, 20 (66%) completed all intervention modules, 25 (83%) were retained at the 2-month follow-up, and 20 (66%) were retained at the 4-month follow-up. None reported adverse effects. From baseline to the 4-month follow-up, large effects were found in food craving (Cohen d=1.64) and reward-based eating (Cohen d=1.56), whereas small effects were found with weight (Cohen d=0.20; 4.21 kg on average). Significant improvements were also found in the secondary outcomes (depression, Cohen d=0.98; anxiety, Cohen d=0.50; mindfulness, Cohen d=0.49; and emotion dysregulation, Cohen d=0.44; all P<.05). Participants with higher levels of parental verbal and emotional abuse were particularly responsive to the intervention. Participants reported that the program aligned with their goals and expectations, was easy to use, and facilitated changes in eating behavior and mental health. Barriers to engagement included the need for diverse teachers, individualized support, and body positive language. CONCLUSIONS: This early phase feasibility trial provides proof-of-concept support for a mindfulness mobile health approach to improve obesity-related outcomes among sexual minority women and warrants a larger randomized controlled trial in the future. The findings also suggest the need to address trauma and psychological health when addressing weight-related outcomes among sexual minority women.",

METHODS: The 26-session CFTp intervention was provided for a sample of eight people with distressing psychotic experiences and a psychosis-related diagnosis. The study aimed to assess acceptability of CFTp and to test clinically reliable improvements while receiving the intervention, compared to a baseline period. RESULTS: Seven of eight participants completed the therapy, and clinically reliable improvements were found at both the single-case and group level of analysis. At the single-case level, over half the participants showed improvements in depression (5/7), stress (5/7), distress (5/7), anxiety (4/7) and voices (3/5). One participant showed a deterioration in anxiety (1/7) and dissociation (1/7). At the group level (n = 7), there were significant improvements in depression, stress, distress, voices and delusions. The improvements in voices, delusions and distress were sustained at 6- to 8-week follow-up, but depression and stress dropped slightly to trend-level improvements. CONCLUSIONS: CFTp is a feasible and acceptable intervention for psychosis, and further investigation is warranted with a randomized controlled trial.",

            "title": "Why is there no compassion for compassionate usage of medication in colorectal cancer care?",
            "abstract": "Background: Metastatic colorectal cancer is one of the commonest causes of cancer and cancer-related deaths.1 The prognosis remains poor and successive treatment options remain limited.2 Many patients will run out of treatment options before they become medically unfit for therapy.3 Cancer drug innovation presents both opportunities and dilemmas as access to innovative cancer medications can be limited by a significant delay between clinical trials, licensing, and positive drug guidance.4,5 Consequently, where no commissioned alternative medicine exists some pharmaceutical companies operate compassionate usage access schemes (Figure 1). These allow cancer treatment with investigational, unlicensed, or off-label medicines as soon as early evidence of potential benefit emerges.6 There is a paucity of information regarding compassionate schemes. This analysis was performed to ascertain real-world data on patients enrolled in these schemes. Methods: Single-centre study conducted at The Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK. We reviewed the process of pharmacy drug set-up and maintenance by undertaking a survey of disease group pharmacists. We undertook a retrospective audit using an electronic patient record of patients who entered into a compassionate scheme between 2018 and 2020. This analysis focused on 27 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer receiving compassionate medication who possessed the BRAF mutation (mBRAF V600E) or MSI-H status. We analysed 17 mBRAF patients treated with a triplet combination (encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab), and subsequently, doublet (encorafenib and cetuximab), as defined by the BEACON study, and 10 MSI-high patients on compassionate nivolumab.7,8 Results: Our survey of compassionate medication across 14 disease groups demonstrated the approval process is lengthy and resource intensive. The average approval time was variable, but pharmacy set-up time could take several days depending on the drug or regimen. However, this is countered by our analysis of 27 meta-static colorectal cancer patients. Most patients were fit (> 88% PS <= 1, 50% had no known co-morbidities) and for 62% this represented third- line therapy, in a cancer setting with limited or no treatment options. Patients received 10 cycles of treatment on average before progression or unsuitability, with a mean duration on the treatment of 120 days (15-317) on the triplet/doublet combination and 205 days on nivolumab (range: 1-663), demonstrating benefit. Patient demand was uninhibited by geographical distance (> 30% of patients lived 20+ miles away from the treatment centre) and the possibility of hope and life extension with further treatment. Conclusion: Our audit demonstrates that patients received compassionate drugs that were subsequently commissioned by NHSE, with some benefiting from treatment for a considerable period. This suggests there was both a moral gain and a survival advantage over best supportive care; however, there remains limited real-world data and further research is required. Access to compassionate schemes is controversial and limited as they can be seen to promote healthcare inequity, creating a post-code lottery, as they may not be available in some regions, circumvent existing guidelines or benefit pharmaceutical companies by allowing early data and market access. Compassionate usage recognises a human side to drug development which requires a moral balance between patients. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "title": "Meditation Awareness Training for the Treatment of Sex Addiction: A Case Study.",
            "abstract": "Background: Sex addiction is a disorder that can have serious adverse functional consequences. Treatment effectiveness research for sex addiction is currently underdeveloped, and interventions are generally based on the guidelines for treating other behavioral (as well as chemical) addictions. Consequently, there is a need to clinically evaluate tailored treatments that target the specific symptoms of sex addiction. It has been proposed that second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) may be an appropriate treatment for sex addiction because in addition to helping individuals increase perceptual distance from craving for desired objects and experiences, some SG-MBIs specifically contain meditations intended to undermine attachment to sex and/or the human body. The current study conducts the first clinical investigation into the utility of mindfulness for treating sex addiction. Case presentation: An in-depth clinical case study was conducted involving an adult male suffering from sex addiction that underwent treatment utilizing an SG-MBI known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT). Following completion of MAT, the participant demonstrated clinically significant improvements in addictive sexual behavior, as well as reductions in depression and psychological distress. The MAT intervention also led to improvements in sleep quality, job satisfaction, and non-attachment to self and experiences. Salutary outcomes were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Discussion and conclusion: The current study extends the literature exploring the applications of mindfulness for treating behavioral addiction, and findings indicate that further clinical investigation into the role of mindfulness for treating sex addiction is warranted.

            "abstract": "Weight stigma is highly prevalent. However, existing weight stigma interventions are only modestly effective at reducing anti-fat attitudes. The current research proposes a novel approach using a loving kindness meditation (LKM). Experiment 1 tests whether random assignment to the LKM intervention reduces explicit and implicit anti-fat bias and increases empathy based on the LKM recipient with higher weight (close other vs. stranger). Experiment 2 tests whether LKM outperforms an empathy intervention or control to increase empathy or reduce stigmatizing behavior. Results revealed that the LKM increased empathic care but did not reduce anti-fat bias compared to control; the LKM intervention, but not the empathy intervention, reported greater empathy compared to control in unadjusted analyses; and participants in the LKM and empathy interventions (vs. control) were more likely to engage in stigmatizing behavior. These findings suggest that the LKM may not be effective at reducing weight stigma despite increasing empathy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "The concept of self-compassion originated from Buddhism, but very little is known about the utility and functions of this concept among Buddhists. Four hundred and eleven individuals (179 Buddhists and 232 non-Buddhists) completed the survey packages using the self-compassion scale (SCS; Neff in Self Identity 2(3):223-250, 2003a. doi:). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the original six dimensions of the SCS were not replicated by both samples, and further analysis of the intra-correlations within dimensions of SCS and relationships between SCS and other variables showed unexpected results specific to Buddhists. Among Buddhists, the dimensions of self-kindness and common humanity neither showed negative correlations with their opposite dimensions nor were associated with better emotional outcomes. In addition, these two dimensions were not predicted by the regular practice of loving-kindness meditation. This study argued that the ideas of self-compassion reflected in the SCS are theoretically different from the ideas of Buddhism, and further implications for measuring and clinically applying self-compassion were discussed.

            "abstract": "Mental health is integral to our well-being and is as important as being physically healthy. The growing incidence of mental health issues in adolescents is a reflection of the reality that confronts us today. Primary Prevention (PP) of mental illnesses especially depression in children and adolescents has only recently taken a hold as distinct from secondary and tertiary preventions. PP for adolescent depression encompasses school based resilience building interventions and community based stigma reduction programme at large. However, the aim of this article is limited to the introduction of approaches that help gradually build and strengthen the resilience factors and promoting the well being by developing new positive behavior among normal adolescents. This new recognition was born out of the necessity as new Mental Health Care Act (MHCA, 2017) places more emphasis on prevention of mental illness and the world health day of this year was celebrated with the theme of \"Depression- let's Talk\" in terms of preventive measures. Depression is a major public health problem in children and adolescents, which makes the identification and implementation of effective interventions an increasing concern at universal or PP level. Therefore, the main aim of this article is to discuss theoretically different psychological interventions for depression in terms of primary prevention. This article presents and discusses new interventions with rationale, such as the Positive Psychology and Mindfulness based interventions for Adolescents, which suggest that the focus of interventions for depressed adolescents should integrate well-being enhancement to achieve optimal functioning as a primary prevention strategies.

            "abstract": "We investigated whether informal meditation practice (i.e., self-reported application of meditative techniques outside a period of formal meditation) was associated with outcomes in smartphone-based loving-kindness and compassion training. Meditation-naive participants (n = 351) with clinically elevated symptoms completed measures of psychological distress, loneliness, empathy, and prosociality at baseline and following a two-week intervention. Informal practice, psychological distress, and loneliness were also assessed daily. Steeper increases in informal practice had small associations with pre-post improvements in distress (r = -.18, p =.008) and loneliness (r = -.19, p =.009) but not empathy or prosociality. Using a currently recommended approach for establishing cross-lagged effects in longitudinal data (latent curve model with structured residuals), higher current-day informal practice was associated with decreased next-day distress with a very small effect size (beta s = -.06 to -.04, p =.018) but not decreased next-day loneliness. No cross-lagged associations emerged from distress or loneliness to informal practice. Findings suggest that further investigation into a potential causal role of informal practice is warranted. Future studies experimentally manipulating informal practice are needed. - Increased informal practice was correlated with pre-post reductions in distress. - Increased informal practice was correlated with pre-post reductions in loneliness. - Higher current-day informal practice predicted lower next-day distress. - No cross-lagged effects of distress or loneliness on informal practice. - Further investigation into a causal role of informal practice is warranted.

            "abstract": "Loving-kindness meditations involve sending feelings of kindness and care to a series of people including oneself, loved ones, strangers, and all beings. Loving-kindness interventions (LKIs), which include knowledge and/or practice related to loving-kindness, have been gaining attention as a potential intervention for improving mental health in adults. This meta-analysis synthesized the effects of LKIs on both positive (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, positive affect) and negative (i.e., negative affect, psychological symptoms) indices of mental health across comparison types (i.e., passive control, active control, alternative treatment) and general sample types (i.e., community, university), and explored characteristics of LKIs that may impact their effectiveness (i.e., intervention format, intervention length, presence/absence of a live facilitator). Following a systematic review of six databases in November 2023, 23 randomized controlled studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Relative to passive control groups, LKIs had positive effects on mindfulness, compassion, positive affect, negative affect, and psychological symptoms; these effects were non-significant relative to active control groups and alternative therapeutic treatments. Notably, the effects of LKIs did not differ as a function of sample type, intervention format, intervention length, or the presence/absence of a live facilitator. Findings provide support for the effectiveness of LKIs relative to passive control conditions, as well as their potential comparability to alternative evidence-based therapeutic treatments, and provide insight into resource-effective approaches to the delivery of effective LKIs. However, additional studies are needed to confirm the impacts of LKIs relative to other interventions in the field. - Loving-kindness interventions (LKIs) have positive effects on mental health. - The significance of effects vary by comparison type (e.g., passive/active control). - LKI characteristics (e.g., length, format) do not moderate these effects. - LKIs may be a viable therapeutic approach to improve positive and negative mental health. - Additional rigorously designed studies evaluating the effects of LKIs are needed.

Loving-kindness meditation involves repetition of phrases of positive intention for self and others. We undertook an open pilot trial of loving-kindness meditation for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Measures of PTSD, depression, self-compassion, and mindfulness were obtained at baseline, after a 12-week loving-kindness meditation course, and 3 months later. Effect sizes were calculated from baseline to each follow-up point, and self-compassion was assessed as a mediator. Attendance was high; 74% attended 9-12 classes. Self-compassion increased with large effect sizes and mindfulness increased with medium to large effect sizes. A large effect size was found for PTSD symptoms at 3-month follow-up ( d = -0.89), and a medium effect size was found for depression at 3-month follow-up ( d = -0.49). There was evidence of mediation of reductions in PTSD symptoms and depression by enhanced self-compassion. Overall, loving-kindness meditation appeared safe and acceptable and was associated with reduced symptoms of PTSD and depression. Additional study of loving-kindness meditation for PTSD is warranted to determine whether the changes seen are due to the loving-kindness meditation intervention versus other influences, including concurrent receipt of other treatments.

            "abstract": "Study Objectives:  We have recently shown higher parietal-occipital EEG gamma activity during sleep in long-term meditators compared to meditation-naive individuals. This gamma increase was specific for NREM sleep, was present throughout the entire night and correlated with meditation expertise, thus suggesting underlying long-lasting neuroplastic changes induced through prolonged training. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroplastic changes acutely induced by 2 intensive days of different meditation practices in the same group of practitioners. We also repeated baseline recordings in a meditation-naive cohort to account for time effects on sleep EEG activity. Design:  High-density EEG recordings of human brain activity were acquired over the course of whole sleep nights following intervention. Setting:  Sound-attenuated sleep research room. Patients or Participants:  Twenty-four long-term meditators and twenty-four meditation-naive controls. Interventions:  Two 8-h sessions of either a mindfulness-based meditation or a form of meditation designed to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, hereafter referred to as compassion meditation. Measurements and Results:  We found an increase in EEG low-frequency oscillatory activities (1-12 Hz, centered around 7-8 Hz) over prefrontal and left parietal electrodes across whole night NREM cycles. This power increase peaked early in the night and extended during the third cycle to high-frequencies up to the gamma range (25-40 Hz). There was no difference in sleep EEG activity between meditation styles in long-term meditators nor in the meditation naive group across different time points. Furthermore, the prefrontal-parietal changes were dependent on meditation life experience. Conclusions:  This low-frequency prefrontal-parietal activation likely reflects acute, meditation-related plastic changes occurring during wakefulness, and may underlie a top-down regulation from frontal and anterior parietal areas to the posterior parietal and occipital regions showing chronic, long-lasting plastic changes in long-term meditators.

This essay is written as a commentary on Roychowdhury et al.'s, (2021, this issue) article in this issue. Specifically, I apply theoretical insights from Roychowdhury et al., (2021, this issue) to the practical model of SG-MBIs. I find that SG-MBIs attempt to respond to ethical concerns with the ways that mindfulness has been commodified, secularized, and universalized through appeals to cultural authenticity. While acknowledging the cultural contexts from which practices like mindfulness have been taken is important, appeals to cultural authenticity often reproduce fixed and essentializing constructions of culture and are easily coopted by neoliberal multiculturalism. As sport and performance psychology professionals reflect on the next generation of mindfulness-based interventions, it will be important to attend to the contextual flexibility of neoliberalism to universalize and essentialize.

A systematic review is reported in line with the PRISMA guideline and was registered in PROSPERO. The PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were used.

Among the programmes for the cultivation of compassion we highlight Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT), Mindfulness and Self-Compassion (MSC), Compassionate Meditation (CM), and Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM). The interventions decreased compassion fatigue and increased compassion, self-compassion, and compassion satisfaction in healthcare professionals. Compassion fatigue in healthcare professionals is due to a deficit in empathic and compassionate skills. Health systems should incorporate programmes based on the cultivation of compassion and self-compassion in order to improve the work conditions and quality of life of health professionals.

            "abstract": "- For the first time, we conducted a coordinates-based meta-analysis and review of functional imaging research in compassion. - From 16 studies, we identified common activation of seven regions which span frontal, salience, and midbrain regions. - Traditions in the literature consider compassion as either driven from emotion, mindset, or modulated by target characteristics or context. - We failed to identify certain regions commonly purported as relevant to compassion, likely due to studies which have utilized Loving-Kindness meditation. - We recommend future work consider clinical populations, computational methods, and measure concrete prosocial behavior. Theoretical and neurophysiological investigations into compassion are burgeoning, yet the putative neural mechanisms which underpin such processes are less well understood. Therefore, we have conducted an Activation-Likelihood Estimate meta-analysis in order to ascertain the shared neural processes consistently identified as relevant to compassion. Our analysis of sixteen fMRI studies revealed activation across seven broad regions, with the largest peaks localized to the Periaqueductal Grey, Anterior Insula, Anterior Cingulate, and Inferior Frontal Gyrus. Overall, we identified a tendency for studies to operationalize compassion in one of three ways, as driven either 'top-down', 'bottom-up', or modified by target context. We failed to identify regions purportedly common to compassion such as the DLPFC, OFC, and Amygdala, possibly due to a small number of studies which used Loving-Kindness meditation. We argue future research in compassion science continue a multi-modal approach to examine links between neural activity and actual prosocial behavior, and recommend the application of fMRI paradigms on compassion with clinically diagnosed populations to parallel current trends in psychotherapy such as Compassion Focused Therapy.

            "abstract": "In this two-part study, we attempted to accomplish two major tasks. In Study 1, with an online sample of Christian-identifying trauma survivors (N = 257), we aimed to empirically investigate our theoretical model, anchored to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. This theoretical model suggests that negative affect mediates the relationship between Christian contentment and Christian gratitude and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other posttrauma symptoms. Based on this theoretical model, in Study 2, with a separate online sample of Christian-identifying trauma survivors (N = 26), we tested an original, online, 2-week program. Specifically, we examined the potential impact that a Christian meditative intervention, lectio divina (Latin for 'divine reading'), has on increasing Christian contentment and Christian gratitude and decreasing PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms. Study 1 results revealed that negative affect mediated the relationship between Christian contentment (but not Christian gratitude) and PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms. Study 2 results suggested that, pre- to post-intervention, the lectio divina group (n = 13) reported a greater decrease in PTSD and other posttrauma symptoms than the loving-kindness meditation control group (n = 13). These results are discussed in the context of both the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions and a growing literature on Christian-sensitive meditative alternatives to Buddhist-influenced mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation for psychological symptoms. Directions for future research and study limitations are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Objectives: This article presents a brief overview of the empirical evidence of well-established mindfulness interventions and an in-depth review of less-established compassion-based interventions (CBIs) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Definitions, cognitive and physiological mechanisms, and methods of assessment are discussed. Method: A literature review using the databases Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and PubMed was conducted. Results: Whereas the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has been documented in many trials, only seven randomized, controlled trials have been completed on CBIs and LKM. In these trials, CBIs were effective in treating psychotic disorders, affective disorders with psychotic features, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, and patients with suicide attempts in the past year; LKMwas effective in treating chronic pain; and a combination of both was effective for borderline personality disorder. A larger number of nonrandomized studies indicate that CBIs and LKMmay be effective in treating a wide range of clinical conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, chronic pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to confirm the promising effects of CBIs and LKM. Preliminary evidence suggests that both approaches might be beneficial across various clinical populations. Future studies need to clarify whether these approaches might be options as stand-alone treatments or as adjuncts or augmentation of evidence-based methods in psychotherapy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "abstract": "Emotional dysregulation poses significant challenges for women who have experienced trauma and can contribute to problems with substance use in an attempt to manage intense emotions and arousal. Various forms of meditation have shown benefits for improved awareness and management of emotions and offer a promising complementary treatment for women in residential substance use treatment who have histories of interpersonal traumas. This qualitative study explored lived experiences with meditation practice and emotional regulation among female trauma survivors with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders. Thirty-two trauma survivors participated in a six-week curriculum at their residential treatment program that included mindfulness, compassion, and loving-kindness meditations. Using an emergent design based on the constant comparative method, the study analyzed qualitative data from individual interviews and focus groups and identified common themes. The findings indicated a perceived pathway through which meditation promoted emotional regulation. This pathway started with increased awareness of their emotions, involved the ability to then accept and let go of their emotions, and ended with emotional growth and improved self-regulation. Though participants portrayed meditation as beneficial, several participants also described suppressed emotions and traumatic memories resurfacing during meditation and described the importance of support from program staff outside of group to help them process and cope. The participants' perspectives support the appropriateness of meditation as an empowering complementary intervention for female trauma survivors with co-occurring disorders, but also indicate the importance of supervision and support at the start of meditation practice in case negative experiences arise.

While many mindfulness-based interventions are focused on addressing particular psychological needs, so-called second-generation mindfulness-based interventions typically include overtly spiritual content but also remain secular in their delivery. More recently, explicitly religion-themed mindfulness programs have emerged that are yet to be evaluated scientifically, raising questions as to how this to occur in the most appropriate manner. Referring to doctrinal charts in Won Buddhism, we illustrate an example of how the distinction can be made transparent between content that can be subjected to scientific inquiry and content related to religious and personal beliefs. By delineating elements of belief from practice, areas can be identified that are open for scientific verification without causing offense. Program participants and other practitioners can then clearly identify the specific aspects for which there is widely accepted evidence for their effectiveness, which may then also be communicated as science-based Buddhist practices.

Looking at the roles of psychological and biological resources over time' by Nikki E. Barczak-Scarboro, Patty Van Cappellen and Barbara L. Fredrickson (Mindfulness, 2021[Nov], Vol 12[11], 2781-2793).

Although these findings hold for most people, individual differences may affect who gets greater gains from meditation. Psychological (i.e., resilience, spirituality) and biological (i.e., cardiac vagal tone, oxytocin) personal resources may work individually or synergistically to catalyze meditation-related improvements in mental health, such as increased positive (well-being) and decreased negative (depression) mental health symptoms. Methods: A community-based sample of 210 adults (modeage = 35 years; 61.86% female) were recruited and randomly assigned to either mindfulness (n = 107; 51.2%) or loving-kindness (n = 102; 48.8%) meditation conditions (1 missing). The study lasted 18 months, starting with baseline measures, succeeded by a 6-week meditation intervention, and follow-up assessments every 3 months. Results: The fixed effect of resilience was significant, as was the interaction between resilience and time, indicating different mental health symptom trajectories during and after a meditation intervention based on resilience. Conclusions: Participants low in resilience tended to have the greatest gains (increased subjective well-being and decreased depressive symptoms) following a meditation intervention, yet these gains were not maintained 18 months following the intervention. Those high in resilience did not show mental health gains following a meditation intervention but did have higher subjective well-being symptoms 18 months following the intervention indicating that they may have experienced delayed gains.

Methods: A literature search was conducted, using PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. Eligible studies included those that were RCTs of any intervention, conducted among healthy workers, measured SWB as a primary outcome, and original articles in English. Study characteristics, intervention, outcomes, and results on SWB outcomes were extracted by the investigators independently. After a brief narrative summarizing and classifying the contents of the interventions, the included outcomes were categorized into each aspect of SWB (evaluative, hedonic, and eudemonic well-being, and the mental component of QOL). Finally, the characteristics of the effective interventions for increasing each aspect were summarized, and the pooled effect of interventions on SWB was investigated by a meta-analysis. Publication bias was investigated by drawing a funnel plot and conducting Egger's test. Results: From the 5,450 articles found, 39 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The interventions included in this review were classified into six categories (physical activity, ergonomics, psychological, environmental, multicomponent intervention, and others). The meta-analysis from 31 studies showed that the pooled effect of included interventions on SWB was significantly positive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.51; standard error (SE) = 0.10). A funnel plot showed there were extremely large or small SMDs, and Egger's test was significant. Thus, we conducted sensitivity analysis, excluding these extreme SMDs, and confirmed that the estimated pooled effect was also significantly positive. Subgroup analyses for separate types of interventions showed the effects of psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) were also significantly positive. Conclusion: The current study revealed the effectiveness of interventions for increasing SWB. Specifically, psychological interventions (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive behavioral based approach, and other psychological interventions) may be useful for improving SWB.

Component studies are one way to test which aspects of psychological treatments impact outcomes or, in other words, are the active ingredients of treatment. As research and popular interest in mindfulness-based programs grows, it is important to evaluate the active ingredients of these programs and to continually refine theorized models of the mechanisms of mindfulness. Studying active ingredients may help clarify which elements of mindfulness-based programs are most important for dissemination. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of component studies of mindfulness-based programs for adults with psychological conditions. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Results: Eight component studies were identified. These studies dismantled mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, unified mindfulness, and core mindfulness processes. The eight studies differed with respect to types of programs and populations studied, yet similarities emerged. Notably, acceptance coupled with awareness and mindfulness meditation training may be two promising active ingredients of these different programs. Conclusions: Future studies examining mindfulness-based programs should continue to attempt to dismantle active ingredients of treatment and use the findings to update theoretical models of mindfulness.

Shame and self-compassion work independently of each other and experiences of shame can impede one's ability to engage in self-compassionate responses, which could prevent future health declines. Although shame has been found to mediate the relationship between self-compassion and a variety of mental health outcomes, it has not been examined in the context of HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the current study was to examine how shame mediates the relationship of self-compassion and adherence to HIV/AIDS medications, as well as how shame mediates the relationship of self-compassion and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people living with HIV (PLWH). This is the first study to look at trait-based shame in PLWH in a sample of 34 patients at an urban outpatient integrated care facility for PLWH. Self-compassion was not correlated with HIV adherence behaviors or HRQL, and shame did not mediate the relationship between self-compassion and adherence or HRQL. However as expected, less shame was related to and predicted better HRQL in PLWH. Self-compassion' relationship to shame, adherence, and HRQL may be context dependent.

Mindfulness-based practices and programs have emerged as a viable alternative to current interventions for such behaviors and the stress faced by their caregivers. This review addresses publications between 2018 and 2019 that examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based practices and programs for people living with IDD. Recent findings: Individuals with IDD can learn mindfulness practices to self-manage their aggressive and destructive behaviors. Individual practices and group-based programs continue to show that mindfulness approaches are effective for this population. Randomized controlled trials indicate that comprehensive mindfulness-based programs (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction, MYmind, and mindfulness-based positive behavior support) are effective for enhancing the quality of life of people living with IDD. Summary: Research supports the use of informal mindfulness practices for challenging behaviors of people with IDD. Formal mindfulness-based programs continue to be evaluated for their effectiveness across different populations, cultures, levels of IDD, components of the program, and length of training. The research literature on mindfulness is still in the early stages of development and much work remains. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "In a recent study, Gebauer et al. addressed a fundamental question regarding the effects of mind-body practices (MBPs) on the self. Does the practice of MBPs in accordance with traditional contemplative traditions quiet the ego or is the practice of MBPs associated with increased self-centrality, which breeds self-enhancement bias? Both hypotheses were investigated in two separate studies with a longitudinal design. Study 1 included 93 participants, who regularly practiced yoga, and study 2 contained 162 participants, who regularly practiced loving-kindness meditation. In both studies, trait questionnaires of self-centrality and self-enhancement were taken after the practice of yoga (over the course of 15 weeks) or meditation (over the course of 4 weeks). Findings from both studies showed that participants scored higher on measures of self-enhancement and self-centrality after practicing yoga and meditation as compared with not practicing yoga and meditation. Based on these findings, Gebauer et al. argued that MBPs such as yoga and meditation do not quiet the ego, but instead lead to self-enhancement bias through increased self-centrality. We have concerns about the far-reaching conclusions made by Gebauer et al. regarding the effects of MBPs on the self. The key concerns refer to the conceptualization of the quiet ego and to the assessment of the psychological constructs investigated in this study. Gebauer et al. addressed a timely and important research question, but their far-reaching interpretations should be reconsidered due to conceptual and methodological ambiguities.

The effect of LKM on positive emotions was estimated with meta-analysis, and the influence of variations across LKM interventions was further explored with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed that (1) medium effect sizes for LKM interventions on daily positive emotions in both wait-list controlled RCTs and non-RCT studies; and (2) small to large effect sizes for the on-going practice of LKM on immediate positive emotions across different comparisons. Further analysis showed that (1) interventions focused on loving-kindness had medium effect size, but interventions focused on compassion showed small effect sizes; (2) the length of interventions and the time spent on meditation did not influence the effect sizes, but the studies without didactic components in interventions had small effect sizes. A few individual studies reported that the nature of positive emotions and individual differences also influenced the results. In sum, LKM practice and interventions are effective in enhancing positive emotions, but more studies are needed to identify the active components of the interventions, to compare different psychological operations, and to explore the applicability in clinical populations.

MB-POTT comprises four distinct, yet recursive, stages: (1) therapeutic alliance building and symptom stabilization, (2) formation of a narrative about the trauma, (3) re-creation of meaning of life after trauma, and (4) future symptom management. In explaining these categories, I delineate the nature of mindfulness, both similarities and dissimilarities to hypnosis, with an emphasis on techniques that resemble hypnotic approaches (e.g., ego state therapy, ego-strengthening). Finally, I provide a case study in which MB-POTT was implemented with a client who suffered from PTSD after a near-fatal industrial accident.

            "abstract": "Recent imaging research shows that approximately 80% of people who transit from acute to chronic pain produce neuroplasticity linking pain pathways to learning areas of the brain, thus showing physiological evidence that chronic pain is largely learned. Mindfulness meditation programs have been used successfully to teach people a way of decreasing pain-related distress and unlearning their unhelpful relationship to pain. However, not all chronic pain patients are amenable to undergo a full mindfulness program and then maintain daily practice. Accordingly, we conducted a pilot study of a task extracted from a second-generation MBI, Mindfulness-integrated Cognitive Behavior Therapy, which consisted of a self-guided 30-s mindfulness-based interoceptive exposure task (MIET) to pain sensations in 15 medically diagnosed chronic pain patients. Participants using the MIET repeatedly over 15 days learned not to identify with pain and focused on four subcomponents of interoception (mass, motion, temperature, and cohesiveness) while remaining equanimous. This led to significant reduction in pain anxiety (p = .001; d = 0.96), pain duration (p = .01; d = 0.86), and pain intensity after each 30-s exposure (p < .001; d = 1.37). These effects were maintained, and some further improved, at 2-month follow-up. Marked decrease in depression, anxiety and stress were also observed (p < .001; d = 0.81). While participants rated the task as highly acceptable and some reduced their use of analgesic medication; no other change in medical or psychological treatment was required. These early results show the potential for the MIET to be use as an adjunct to traditional treatments of chronic pain, although controlled studies are needed to establish the validity of our results. Brain-imaging studies are also needed to assess the possible unlearning effect of the MIET on corticolimbic regions, a process that may be termed 'central desensitization.'

The intervention was further assessed through self-ratings and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) administered prior to treatment, immediately after treatment and at a 6-week follow-up. Tau-U analyses showed for the majority of the 12 completers a significant reduction of PTSD symptoms and a significant increase in well-being. Furthermore, we found large effects on PTSD symptoms as measured by the CAPS-5 (Hedges' g = 1.66), as well as on depression (Hedges' g = 1.08) and psychological distress (Hedges' g = 0.85), complemented by relevant increases in mindfulness skills and self-compassion. This study contributes evidence that mindfulness and loving-kindness are useful for reducing PTSD in victims of interpersonal violence, especially when the intervention is tailored to the specific needs of these patients.

The comprehensive database search yielded 342 papers and 20 studies (comprising a total of 1,312 participants) were eligible for inclusion. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was then used to assess study quality. Participants demonstrated significant improvements across five psychopathology-relevant outcome domains: (i) positive and negative affect, (ii) psychological distress, (iii) positive thinking, (iv) interpersonal relations, and (v) empathic accuracy. It is concluded that LKM and CM interventions may have utility for treating a variety of psychopathologies. However, to overcome obstacles to clinical integration, a lessons-learned approach is recommended whereby issues encountered during the (ongoing) operationalization of mindfulness interventions are duly considered. In particular, there is a need to establish accurate working definitions for LKM and CM. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",

However, concerns have arisen relating to how mindfulness is operationalized in mindfulness-based interventions and whether its 'spiritual essence' and full potential treatment efficacy have remained intact. This qualitative study used interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine participant experiences regarding the acceptability and effectiveness of a newly designed secularized intervention called meditation awareness training (MAT) that follows a more traditional Buddhist approach to meditation. Participants (with issues of stress and low mood) reported experiencing improvements in psychological well-being due to receiving MAT. The wider implications are discussed.

            "abstract": "Meditation is becoming increasingly popular as a topic for scientific research and theories on meditation are becoming ever more specific. We distinguish between what is called focused Attention meditation, open Monitoring meditation, and loving kindness (or compassion) meditation. Research suggests that these meditations have differential, dissociable effects on a wide range of cognitive (control) processes, such as attentional selection, conflict monitoring, divergent, and convergent thinking. Although research on exactly how the various meditations operate on these processes is still missing, different kinds of meditations are associated with different neural structures and different patterns of electroencephalographic activity. In this review we discuss recent findings on meditation and suggest how the different meditations may affect cognitive processes, and we give suggestions for directions of future research.

            "abstract": "We compared the relative effects of 5 weeks of either concentration or loving-kindness meditation (CM, LKM) on mindfulness (including two subscales-presence and acceptance) and affect using a multiple baseline ABA design. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) indicated that 48-71 % of the total variance was attributable to individual differences. While meditating, CM practitioners experienced progressive increases in mindfulness and acceptance, while LKM practitioners exhibited increases in mindfulness, presence, and positive affect. When practitioners ceased meditation, those in the CM condition declined in mindfulness, acceptance, and positive affect throughout the cessation period. Individuals in the LKM group showed a progressive decrease in presence and a singular drop in negative affect immediately following meditation. There was a dissociation between acceptance and presence, with CM influencing the former and LKM the latter. Because mindfulness and positive affect did not decrease after the meditation period for the LKM group, these results suggest that LKM may induce more enduring changes in these variables. However, while meditation-specific HLMs indicated differences between meditation types, a combined HLM with both meditation conditions showed no group differences in the meditation or cessation phases of the study. More substantial were individual differences in response to meditation; these point to the necessity of using either large sample sizes in group means testing for meditation research or techniques permitting individual-based analysis such as HLM and single-subject designs.

            "abstract": "Therapists and other health professionals might benefit from interventions that increase their self-compassion and other-focused concern since these may strengthen their relationships with clients, reduce the chances of empathetic distress fatigue and burnout and increase their well-being. This article aimed to review the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and loving-kindness mediation (LKM) in cultivating clinicians' self-compassion and other-focused concern. Despite methodological limitations, the studies reviewed offer some support to the hypothesis that MBIs can increase self-compassion in health professionals, but provide a more mixed picture with regard to MBIs' affect on other-focused concern. The latter finding may in part be due to ceiling effects; therefore future research, employing more sensitive measures, would be beneficial. Turning to LKM, there is encouraging preliminary evidence from non-clinician samples that LKM, or courses including LKM and related practices, can increase self-compassion and other-focused concern. As well as extending the LKM evidence base to health professionals and using more robust, large-scale designs, future research could usefully seek to identify the characteristics of people who find LKM challenging and the supports necessary to teach them LKM safely.

            "abstract": "Purpose: Complementary therapy is for improvement of quality of life and for restoring balance in both physical and mental well-being. As an intervention among many different kinds of mind-body medicine, the AT program has a long history of treating medical conditions that are associated with stress, including cancer patients. This study reviewed an experience at one major hospital in Korea with cancer patients. Material and Methods: AT is a set of mental exercises using different phrases that are repeated as silent thoughts. AT aims to reach profound relaxation status (meditative status) with diligent daily practice 2-3 times a day) for 2 to 3 minutes at a time. This was the first time to apply a wall-defined MBM program, an AT program, in Korea. Instead of the standard 8 weeks of AT, a shortened version of 5 weeks was planned for cancer patients who were exhausted from ongoing or previous cancer treatment. The program schedule is shown at the end. Results: Between January 2006 and June 2007K 64 patients (11 groups) from the oncology center of the university hospital joined he program and the majority had breast cancer primary. Thirteen of 64 patients dropped out after 1 to 2 days' participating. The compliance rate was 79.6%. The majority of them experienced meditative status after 3 weeks' practice. Patients who were interested in continuing practice and supporting each other held weekly meetings inside the hospital and gathered on a regular basis with A7 practice and loving-kindness meditation (originally from the Dr. Alan Wallace program, written in the book The Attention Revolution). During the 5-week courses with the first group of patients, all conversations were recorded and retyped for review. Also, we reviewed the written essays from all previous participants to analyze the benefits and the limitations. In the last few groups, photographs of their facial expression were taken on digital camera before and on the last day of the courses. Their facial expression indicated that AT practice enabled them to smile with less rigidity. In May 2007, this AT program was applied to one group of 11 patients at a public health center. Compared with patients at the university hospital, patients at the health center were older (range 55 78) and poor. Five patients completed the course with one or two missed sessions. But another three patients could not come to the sessions owing to the hospital schedule. Only the remaining three patients did not attend without further explanation. The compliance from the patient group at the public health center also was near 50%, which is similar to the compliance rate reported in articles. Summary: The 5 week AT program enabled the majority of patients to achieve meditative status. The compliance rate was very good, with 80% in the university setting and nearly 50% at the public health center. Also, the continuing practice as a supporting group at a weekly basis was another way for them to practice on a regular basis with each other's stimulation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Meditation practices have traditionally been used to cultivate prosocial outcomes, and recently investigations have sought to evaluate their efficacy for these outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of meditation for prosocial emotions and behavior. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane databases (inception to April 2016) using the following search terms: mindfulness, meditation, mind-body therapies, tai chi, yoga, MBSR, MBCT, empathy, compassion, love, altruism, sympathy, or kindness. Randomized controlled trials in any population were included (26 studies with 1714 subjects). Most were conducted among healthy adults (n = 11) using compassion or loving kindness meditation (n = 18) over 8-12 weeks (n = 12) in a group format (n = 17). Most control groups were wait-list or no treatment (n = 15). Outcome measures included self-reported emotions (e.g., composite scores, validated measures) and observed behavioral outcomes (e.g., helping behavior in real-world and simulated settings). Many studies showed a low risk of bias. Results demonstrated small to medium effects of meditation on self-reported (SMD = .40, p < .001) and observable outcomes (SMD = .45, p < .001) and suggest psychosocial and neurophysiological mechanisms of action. Subgroup analyses also supported small to medium effects of meditation even when compared to active control groups. Clinicians and meditation teachers should be aware that meditation can improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",

Investigating heart rate, heart rate variability, experienced effort and likeability during training of three types of meditation' by Anna-Lena Lumma, Bethany E. Kok and Tania Singer (International Journal of Psychophysiology, 2015[Jul], Vol 97[1], 38-45). In the original article, there were errors due to analysis of incomplete participant data files. The authors re-ran all analyses reported in the publication, now including the previously missing data. Extensive corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2015-25746-010[/rid]). Meditation is often associated with a relaxed state of the body. However, meditation can also be regarded as a type of mental task and training, associated with mental effort and physiological arousal. The cardiovascular effects of meditation may vary depending on the type of meditation, degree of mental effort, and amount of training. In the current study we assessed heart rate (HR), high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and subjective ratings of effort and likeability during three types of meditation varying in their cognitive and attentional requirements, namely breathing meditation, loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation. In the context of the ReSource project, a one-year longitudinal mental training study, participants practiced each meditation exercise on a daily basis for 3months. As expected HR and effort were higher during loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared to breathing meditation. With training over time HR and likeability increased, while HF-HRV and the subjective experience of effort decreased. The increase in HR and decrease in HF-HRV over training was higher for loving-kindness meditation and observing-thoughts meditation compared to breathing meditation. In contrast to implicit beliefs that meditation is always relaxing and associated with low arousal, the current results show that core meditations aiming at improving compassion and meta-cognitive skills require effort and are associated with physiological arousal compared to breathing meditation. Overall these findings can be useful in making more specific suggestions about which type of meditation is most adaptive for a given context and population.

            "abstract": "Over the last three decades, a growing number of scientists and clinicians have been investigating the utility of meditative practices as attention and emotion regulation strategies. Many studies have provided evidence that mindfulness meditation can have positive effects on psychotherapists' capacity to offer presence, acceptance and empathy to their clients. More recently, loving-kindness meditation and compassion meditation have become the focus of scientific scrutiny as it has been thought that they could have even more impact on psychotherapists' empathy than mindfulness meditation. This article reviews the scientific literature on loving-kindness and compassion meditation regarding particularly the potential impact of these meditative practices on the development of psychotherapists' empathy. Studies in neuroscience have shown that loving-kindness and compassion meditation actually change the brain in areas associated with positive emotions and empathy. Loving-kindness and compassion meditation training studies have shown positive impacts on a number of empathy-related variables such as altruism, positive regard, prosocial behavior, interpersonal relationships, as well as affective empathy and empathic accuracy. Moreover, loving-kindness and compassion meditation actually reduce negative affects associated to empathy for pain, thus reducing the risk of psychotherapists' burnout and enhancing their self-care. It is concluded that loving-kindness and compassion meditation would constitute an important and useful addition to every counselling or psychotherapy training curriculum.

The term compassion fatigue was coined to describe symptoms of emotional and physical fatigue experienced by workers in these environments. However, empirical research contends that compassion does not cause fatigue, rather compassion is said to foster well-being and is neurologically rejuvenating. The objective of this review was to examine the scientific literature which investigated the compassion-enhancing practice of loving kindness meditation (LKM). This review suggests that LKM can be seen as an alternate strategy to reduce stress, ease empathic distress, and increase positive affect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

I first describe the aims of the PMI and then summarize the foundational assumptions that led me to expand adaptive disclosure and create adaptive disclosure-enhanced (AD-E). The foundational assumptions are that (a) moral injury is a unique measurable potential clinical problem, (b) moral injury damages the sustaining building blocks to personal and collective humanity, and (c) repairing moral injury requires corrective humanizing and virtuous experiences and connections. I then provide an overview of AD-E and describe two new change agents- loving-kindness meditation and letter writing-that augment the original AD in service of promoting corrective experiences in the social world that are valued, valuing, and promote the experience of belonging.

It included weekly training sessions and daily practices of loving-kindness meditation in small groups via telephone conferences for six weeks and an extended group meditation practice for another six weeks.Community-living older adults (age 60+) with multiple chronic conditions and experiencing social isolation were recruited. Each participant was assessed at the pretest, posttest, and follow-up (6 and 12 weeks after pretest). Outcome measures included social interaction, loneliness, and depressive symptoms. Open-ended questions were asked in the posttest and follow-up.Sixteen individuals enrolled, and fourteen completed the program (87.5% retention). Completers showed high levels of adherence (95% attendance to training) and acceptability and a statistically significant increase in social interaction at follow-up. Qualitative data suggest that participants experienced changes in emotion regulation, motivation and confidence, and sense of belonging.A group-based telephone-delivered meditation intervention targeting chronically ill older adults who experience social isolation is technically feasible, very acceptable, and potentially beneficial to them.Older adults enjoy learning meditation. Telephone conferencing is a low-cost tool for engaging socially isolated older adults in social interactions and group meditation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "abstract": "Background:  Nurses vicariously exposed to the suffering of those in their care are at risk of compassion fatigue. Emerging research suggests that self-compassion interventions may provide protective factors and enhance resilience. This pilot study examined the effect of an eight-week Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training intervention on nurses' compassion fatigue and resilience and participants' lived experience of the effect of the training. Methods:  This observational mixed research pilot study adopted an evaluation design framework. It comprised of a single group and evaluated the effects of a pilot MSC intervention by analyzing the pre- and post-change scores in self-compassion, mindfulness, secondary trauma, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and resilience. The sample of the nurses' (N = 13) written responses to the question, \"How did you experience the effect of this pilot MSC training?\" were also analyzed. Results:  The Pre- to Post- scores of secondary trauma and burnout declined significantly and were negatively associated with self-compassion (r = -.62, p = .02) (r = -.55, p = .05) and mindfulness (r = -.54, p = .05). (r = -.60, p = .03), respectively. Resilience and compassion satisfaction scores increased. All variables demonstrated a large effect size: Mean (M) Cohen's d = 1.23. The qualitative emergent themes corroborated the quantitative findings and expanded the understanding about how MSC on the job practices enhanced nurses' coping. Conclusion:  This is the first study to examine the effect of a pilot (MSC) training program on nurses' compassion fatigue and resilience in this new area of research. It provides some preliminary empirical evidence in support of the theorized benefits of self-compassion training for nurses. However, further research, such as a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with a larger sample size and a longitudinal study, is required to see if the benefits of self-compassion training are sustainable.

Existing studies on LKCM have also provided supportive evidence of its benefits and effectiveness under organizational contexts. The current meta-analytical study aimed to systematically summarise the effects of LKCM in the workplace and to outline directions for future research and practice. Among 327 empirical studies on LKCM published until March 2022, 21 trials focussed on employees and provided sufficient information, which were included in the following meta-analysis. The results showed that LKCM benefited eight categories of workplace outcomes. Specifically, LKCM effectively decreased employees' burnout (g = 0.395, k = 10) and stress (g = 0.544, k = 10) and facilitated their mindfulness (g = 0.558, k = 14), self-compassion (g = 0.646, k = 12), personal mental health (g = 0.308, k = 13), job attitudes (g = 0.283, k = 4), interpersonal relationships (g = 0.381, k = 12), and psychological resources (g = 0.406, k = 6). The results of moderation analyses further indicated that the participants' job type, gender, and the focus of LKCM might differentially fluctuate the magnitude of LKCM effects. To advance research and best practice, we finally pointed out several issues that deserve attention, such as long-term effects, underlying mechanisms, potential moderators, and outcomes or influential factors at the organizational level.

Results: The findings are presented under two main themes: Descent and ascent in caring for which emerged from category from being denial to acceptance, from lack of patience to compassion, from using to not using medication, and desperate yet responsibility. Another theme, caregivers' life learning emerged from the category of ongoing caring for and getting through in caring for.

            "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is a mass traumatic event that has universally and indiscriminately negatively affected the world. The adverse consequences of the pandemic have globally impacted psychological health and well-being via increased stressors, such as uncertainty, health anxieties, and financial instability. During the initial months of the pandemic, we (Polizzi et al., 2020) identified coping strategies that may be well-suited to address the sequelae of the pandemic. These strategies included behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, and loving-kindness meditation. We argued that these coping skills may foster resilience and recovery during the pandemic by generating a sense of social connection, encouraging meaning-making, and enhancing feelings of control amid uncertainty. Three years later, we update our initial suggestions by providing a narrative review that considers empirical evidence collected during the pandemic to support the utility of the previously identified coping strategies as well as additional strategies. We also discuss cross-cultural similarities and differences among these strategies and how research supports their application across diverse countries and groups. Finally, we conclude by synthesizing the literature within a regulatory flexibility framework that emphasizes flexible skill implementation with respect to sensitivity to context, coping repertoires, and feedback from the environment.

            "abstract": "This article explores what truth-telling might look like in dialogue with clients around psychiatric medication, especially as it relates to the chemical imbalance metaphor and data about drug effectiveness. Discussions of these matters with clients should be centered in open critical dialogue that acknowledges complexity and uncertainty. It is proposed that providers be more explicit, straightforward, and truthful with clients. Specifically, providers should explain that, for some people, the alterations produced by psychiatric medications are desirable, helpful, and even life-saving. For others, however, that same drug can produce effects that are undesirable, intolerable, or even quite harmful physically or behaviorally. Providers can affirm, with compassion and hope, positive outcomes with medication and convey heartfelt understanding and empathy with negative outcomes. Embracing a contemporary truth-telling mode of communication will require professional courage in resisting the forces that perpetuate the illusion of clarity around the etiology and treatment of mental and emotional challenges, as well as professional humility to accept these limits to knowledge and the ability to give complete answers to all client questions.

            "abstract": "Loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) was a promising intervention for improving life satisfaction, but previous findings have been inconsistent. The current study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 23 empirical studies on LKCM with life satisfaction as an outcome variable. The primary meta-analysis indicated that LKCM significantly enhanced life satisfaction in pre-post design (g = 0.312, k = 15, n = 451), but the significance disappeared in the additional meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (g = 0.106, k = 6, n = 404). Moderator analyses found significant effects for type of control (i.e., the effects of LKCM were inferior to active control group, but superior to waitlist condition), but not for other moderators (i.e., participant type, previous meditation experience, specific protocol, components of LKCM, combination with mindfulness mediation, and intervention length). Narrative review identified self-compassion and positive emotions as important mediators. The practice time of LKCM had indirect but not direct association with life satisfaction. The findings supported that LKCM is promising in increasing life satisfaction, but more studies are needed to investigate the effects with more rigorous designs. Future studies should investigate other potential mechanisms and clarify whether LKCM change the reality or the perception of life. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The year 2003 was a time before the iPhone, before Facebook, long before the COVID-19 pandemic, and certainly before advances in artificial intelligence brought algorithm- delivered content to our digital devices and large language models could mimic human interaction disturbingly well. Yet, Baer's meta-analysis examined the effects of MBIs on the same clinical challenges that plague us today: depression, anxiety, stress, and pain. In 2003, self-compassion was only just emerging as a term in the scientific lexicon and experimental work studying interventions based on loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) was still almost a decade away. Now that the LKCM literature has grown large enough to allow large-scale meta-analyses like that conducted by Lv et al. (2023), it seems an opportune time to look toward the MBI literature-looking backward for lessons learned and looking forward for innovations on the horizon-to help guide the younger but no less promising field of LKCM research.

This systematic review included 22 FIM interventions that reported associations between the amount of meditation practice and its outcomes. Despite the heterogeneity in intervention components and outcome variables, there were generally few significant associations between amount of meditation practice and its outcomes. Specifically, only five studies reported that more than half of the calculated results were significant. In comparison with correlations between total amount of practice and overall outcomes, the short-term influence of meditation practice was evaluated in fewer studies; however, it had a better association with outcomes. More studies are required that address the underlying mechanisms that elucidate how meditation practice leads to outcome changes in daily life. In this study, two promising mechanisms with initial evidence were discussed.

Kok et al. claimed to have demonstrated that practicing loving-kindness meditation (LKM) generates an 'upward spiral' of mutual enhancement among positive emotions, social connectedness, and physical health, the latter being indexed by vagal nerve tone (VNT). Kok et al. hypothesized that participants in the LKM group would show greater increases in positive emotions than those in the control group, and that this effect would be moderated by initial high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV). They further hypothesized that increased positive emotions would lead to increased perceptions of social connections, which in turn would lead to increased end-point HF-HRV, a series of effects that they described as an 'upward spiral.' These hypotheses were represented by what Kok et al. described as a 'variant of a mediational, parallel-process, latent curve model' which can be considered a mediated moderation model with positive emotions and social connectedness as mediators. Kok et al. relied on HF-HRV as a proxy for VNT, which they in turn interpreted as a surrogate measure for physical health. However, many researchers have cautioned against using VNT as an index of physical health because of its complexity and ambiguous clinical significance. Without a significant positive main effect of LKM on change in HF-HRV, the principal claim that positive emotions enhance physical health and the bold assertion that perceived positive social connections account for an upward spiral between positive emotions and VNT are unsupported by our reanalysis: There appears to be no upward spiral to be explained.

Kok and Tania Singer (Mindfulness, Advanced Online Publication, Aug 19, 2016, np).

The correct Figure 2 is provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-40750-001[/rid]). Despite increasing interest in the effects of mental training practices such as meditation, there is much ambiguity regarding whether and to what extent the various types of mental practice have differential effects on psychological change. To address this gap, we compare the effects of four common meditation practices on measures of state change in affect, mind-wandering, meta-cognition, and interoception. In the context of a 9-month mental training program called the ReSource Project, 229 mid-life adults (mean age 41) provided daily reports before and after meditation practice. Participants received training in the following three successive modules: the first module (presence) included breathing meditation and body scan, the second (affect) included loving-kindness meditation, and the third (perspective) included observing-thought meditation. Using multilevel modeling, we found that body scan led to the greatest state increase in interoceptive awareness and the greatest decrease in thought content, loving-kindness meditation led to the greatest increase in feelings of warmth and positive thoughts about others, and observing-thought meditation led to the greatest increase in meta-cognitive awareness. All practices, including breathing meditation, increased positivity of affect, energy, and present focus and decreased thought distraction. Complementary network analysis of intervariate relationships revealed distinct phenomenological clusters of psychological change congruent with the content of each practice. These findings together suggest that although different meditation practices may have common beneficial effects, each practice can also be characterized by a distinct short-term psychological fingerprint, the latter having important implications for the use of meditative practices in different intervention contexts and with different populations.

Here, we link contemplative accounts of compassion and loving-kindness practices with research from social cognitive neuroscience and social psychology to generate predictions about how diverse practices may alter brain structure and function and related aspects of social cognition. Contingent on the nuances of the practice, kindness-based meditation may enhance the neural systems related to faster and more basic perceptual or motor simulation processes, simulation of another's affective body state, slower and higher-level perspective-taking, modulatory processes such as emotion regulation and self/other discrimination, and combinations thereof. This theoretical model will be discussed alongside best practices for testing such a model and potential implications and applications of future work.

The authors explored whether meditation training to enhance emotional awareness improves discrimination of subtle emotional feelings hypothesized to guide decision-making. Long-term meditators and nonmeditators were compared on measures of self-reported valence and arousal, skin conductance response (SCR), and facial electromyography (EMG) to masked and nonmasked emotional pictures, and on measures of heartbeat detection and self-reported emotional awareness. Groups responded similarly to nonmasked pictures. In the masked condition, only controls showed discrimination in valence self-reports. However, meditators reported greater emotional clarity than controls, and meditators with higher clarity had reduced arousal and improved valence discrimination in the masked condition. These findings provide qualified support for the somatic marker hypothesis and suggest that meditation may influence how emotionally ambiguous information is processed, regulated, and represented in conscious awareness.

Study 1 examined the correlation between changes in dispositional mindfulness and changes in CGS over a 3-4 month period in patients participating in a pilot randomised controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Results indicated that increases in dispositional mindfulness were significantly associated with decreases in CGS, although this effect could not be attributed specifically to the group who had received training in meditation. Study 2 explored the impact of brief periods of either breathing or loving kindness meditation on CGS in 55 healthy participants. Contrary to expectation, a brief period of meditation increased CGS. Further analyses indicated that this effect was restricted to participants low in goal re-engagement ability who were allocated to loving kindness meditation. Longer term changes in dispositional mindfulness are associated with reductions in CGS in patients with depressed mood. However initial reactions to meditation, and in particular loving kindness meditation, may be counterintuitive and further research is required in order to determine the relationship between initial reactions and longer-term benefits of meditation practice.

            "abstract": "In the current article, the authors examine the potential role of mind-body interventions for preventing or reducing health disparities in a specific group-African American women. The authors first discuss how health disparities affect this group, including empirical evidence regarding the influence of biopsychosocial processes (e.g., psychological stress and social context) on disparate health outcomes. They also detail how African American women's unique stress experiences as a result of distinct sociohistorical and cultural experiences related to race and gender potentially widen exposure to stressors and influence stress responses and coping behaviors. Using two independent, but related, frameworks (Superwoman Schema [SWS] and the Strong Black Woman Script [SBW-S]), they discuss how, for African American women, stress is affected by 'strength' (vis-a-vis resilience, fortitude, and self-sufficiency) and the emergent health-compromising behaviors related to strength (e.g., emotional suppression, extraordinary caregiving, and self-care postponement). The authors then describe the potential utility of three mind-body interventions-mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), loving-kindness meditation (LKM), and NTU psychotherapy-for specifically targeting the stress-, strength-, and contextually related factors that are thought to influence disparate outcomes for African American women. Self-awareness, self-care, inter- and intrapersonal restorative healing and a redefinition of inner strength may manifest through developing a mindfulness practice to decrease stress-related responses; using LKM to cultivate compassion and forgiveness for self and others; and the balance of independence and interdependence as a grounding NTU principle for redefining strength. The authors conclude with a discussion of potential benefits for integrating key aspects of the interventions with recommendations for future research.

Meditation practices based on loving kindness have been piloted for treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Both types of therapy have been associated with improved immune functioning and enhanced telomerase activity.

Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions relative to those in the control group, an effect moderated by baseline vagal tone, a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions, in turn, produced increases in vagal tone, an effect mediated by increased perceptions of social connections. This experimental evidence identifies one mechanism-perceptions of social connections-through which positive emotions build physical health, indexed as vagal tone. Results suggest that positive emotions, positive social connections, and physical health influence one another in a self-sustaining upward-spiral dynamic.

Psychodrama, certain types of sensory awareness training, and Theravada meditation are examples of therapeutic methods of interaction realized in experiencing and acting between partners, feelings, and experiences. In teaching group psychotherapy and group counseling, one may facilitate the experiencing of interaction by offering help for restructuring the personal Weltbild. The experiencing of interaction is then refined as relativity, both in time and space, and as continuous life change-instead of the belief either in terror of absolute causal determinism or in the ethically noncommital identity or discontinuity of identities. Due to the overcoming of suffering, which originates from the discrepancy between the ever-changing process of life and verbally imposed identities, the interaction is experienced as healing and emancipating.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increasing pressure of their professional duties has led to a notable concern regarding the mounting anxiety levels among nurses. The ongoing discussion revolves around the efficacy of mindfulness as a means to alleviate anxiety in nurses. AIM: This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness in reducing anxiety among nurses. METHODS: The evaluation followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. An extensive and comprehensive search was conducted across eight databases to identify studies that utilized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and were published in English between 2011 and 2022. Independently, two reviewers assessed the validity of the randomized controlled trials using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials criteria. Additionally, two authors independently employed the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-2) method to evaluate the potential bias in the RCTs. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trial studies that were deemed eligible were included in the current analysis. Based on the literature review, it was determined that mindfulness-based training can assist nurses in reducing their anxiety levels. Furthermore, the effectiveness of mindfulness-based programs in enhancing nurses' mindfulness and self-compassion has been firmly established. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Based on existing literature, mindfulness-based interventions have proven to be effective in reducing anxiety levels among nurses. However, in order to enhance the overall quality of research, it is necessary to implement more rigorous controlled designs that include randomization. Additionally, larger sample sizes with a diverse range of participants are needed to establish and validate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based programs in alleviating anxiety among nurses. Implementing mindfulness-based training in healthcare organizations can offer numerous benefits. One such advantage is that it can help nurses in reducing anxiety and enhancing their ability to handle the pressures associated with their profession.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Respiratory-gated Auricular Vagal Afferent Nerve stimulation (RAVANS) is a safe nonpharmacological approach to managing chronic pain. The purpose of the current study was to examine (1) the feasibility and acceptability of RAVANS, combined with mindful meditation (MM) for chronic low back pain (CLBP), (2) the potential synergy of MM+RAVANS on improving pain, and (3) possible moderators of the influence of MM+RAVANS on pain. DESIGN: Pilot feasibility and acceptability study. SETTING: Pain management center at large academic medical center. SUBJECTS: Nineteen adults with CLBP and previous MM training. METHODS: Participants attended two sessions during which they completed quantitative sensory testing (QST), rated pain severity, and completed a MM+stimulation session. Participants received RAVANS during one visit and sham stimulation during the other, randomized in order. Following intervention, participants repeated QST. RESULTS: MM+RAVANS was well tolerated, acceptable, and feasible to provide relief for CLBP. Both MM+stimulation sessions resulted in improved back pain severity, punctate pain ratings, and pressure pain threshold. Individuals with greater negative affect showed greater back pain improvement from MM+RAVANS while those with greater mindfulness showed greater back pain improvement from MM+sham. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that for CLBP patients with prior MM training, the analgesic effects of MM may have overshadowed effects of RAVANS given the brief single session MM+RAVANS intervention. However, those with greater negative affect may benefit from combined MM+RAVANS.",

The feasibility and effectiveness of an adapted MBCT program is explored, together with the possible process of change. Method: Mixed-method study with 31 ADHD patients participating in an adapted MBCT program. Self-report questionnaires on ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, patient functioning, and health status were administered before and after MBCT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 patients. Results: A modest drop-out of n = 5 (16%) was found. MBCT resulted in a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms and improvements of executive functioning, self-compassion, and mental health. Qualitative analysis provided insight in facilitators and barriers participants experienced, and their process of change. Conclusion: The adapted MBCT program seemed to be feasible for adults with ADHD and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness is shown. An adequately powered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is needed to further examine the effectiveness of MBCT for ADHD.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of Mindfulness - Based Compassionate Living (MBCL) as a follow-up intervention to Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy in adults with recurrent depression. We conducted an uncontrolled study in 17 patients with recurrent depression, in two successive groups. The first group contained novices to compassion training (N = 14); in the second group, ten of these participated again, in addition to three new participants (N = 13). The overall group contained 15 females and 2 males, aged between 37 and 71. The MBCL program was qualitatively evaluated using post-intervention focus group interviews in both groups. In addition, self-report questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, worry and both self-compassion and mindfulness skills were administered before and after MBCL. No patients dropped out of the intervention. Average attendance was 7.52 (SD 0.73) out of eight sessions. Helpful elements were theory on the emotion regulation systems, practicing self-compassion explicitly and embodiment of a compassionate attitude by the teachers. Unhelpful elements were the lack of a clear structure, lack of time to practice compassion for self and the occurrence of the so-called back draft effect. We adapted the program in accordance with the feedback of the participants. Preliminary results showed a reduction in depressive symptoms in the second group, but not in the first group, and an increase in self-compassion in both groups. Worry and overall mindfulness did not change. MBCL appears to be feasible and acceptable for patients suffering from recurrent depressive symptoms who previously participated in MBCT. Selection bias may have been a factor as only experienced and motivated participants were used; this, however, suited our intention to co-create MBCL in close collaboration with knowledgeable users. Examination of the effectiveness of MBCL in a sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial is needed.",

            "abstract": "AimTo explore, for the first time, whether a modified mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) course has the potential to reduce stress and burnout among National Health Service (NHS) General Practitioners. BACKGROUND: There is a crisis of low morale among NHS GPs, with most describing their workload as 'unmanageable'. MBCT has been demonstrated to improve stress and burnout in other populations, but has not yet been evaluated in a cohort of NHS GPs. METHODS: NHS GPs in South East England (n=22) attended a modified version of the MBCT course approved by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for prevention of depressive relapse. This comprised eight weekly 2-h sessions with homework (mindfulness practice) between sessions. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) before (baseline) and then again one month (T2) and three months (T3) after attending the course. We also obtained qualitative data on participants' experiences of the course.FindingsCompliance with the intervention was very high. All GPs attended at least six sessions and all completed baseline questionnaires. At T2, data were obtained from 21 participants (95%); PSS scores were significantly lower than at baseline (P&lt;0.001), as were MBI emotional exhaustion (P&lt;0.001) and depersonalization scores (P=0.0421). At T3 we obtained data for 13 participants (59%); PSS scores and MBI emotional exhaustion scores were significantly lower (P&lt;0.001; P=0.0024, respectively) and personal accomplishment scores were significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) than at baseline. Participants reported that the course helped them to manage work pressures, feel more relaxed, enjoy their work and experience greater empathy and compassion (for self, colleagues and patients). Findings of this preliminary evaluation are promising. Further research is needed to evaluate this approach within a larger randomized-controlled trial.",

            "abstract": "The Four Immeasurables Meditations (FIM) intervention have been shown as a promising intervention for reducing depressive symptoms. The current study is a systematic review of FIM intervention effects on depressive symptoms. Among 192 empirical research articles on FIM published before May 2019, 40 independent trials from 35 records measured depressive symptoms. The meta-analysis included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCT; n = 1468) and 16 uncontrolled trials (n = 376). The results supported overall effectiveness of FIM on depressive symptoms (d = 0.38 for RCT and d = 0.87 for uncontrolled trials). Moderator analysis indicated the effects differed across protocols, and effects were smaller in RCT using active control groups. No significant differences were observed for participant type, measures, intervention length, or intervention components. Individual studies found no direct association between meditation practice time and effects, and mindfulness and self-compassion were widely supported as mechanisms of change. Current evidence supports FIM as an effective intervention for reducing depressive symptoms, but additional studies with more rigorous designs using active control groups are needed. Further investigation should be encouraged regarding specific protocols and participants, the contribution of meditation practice, and other mechanisms such as positive emotions.",

To date, no compelling research addresses MBCT's mechanisms of change. This study determines whether MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment, and/or by alterations in post-treatment cognitive reactivity. The study was embedded in a randomized controlled trial comparing MBCT with maintenance antidepressants (mADM) with 15-month follow-up (Kuyken et al., 2008). Mindfulness and self-compassion were assessed before and after MBCT treatment (or at equivalent time points in the mADM group). Post-treatment reactivity was assessed one month after the MBCT group sessions or at the equivalent time point in the mADM group. One hundred and twenty-three patients with \u22653 prior depressive episodes, and successfully treated with antidepressants, were randomized either to mADM or MBCT. The MBCT arm involved participation in MBCT, a group-based psychosocial intervention that teaches mindfulness skills, and discontinuation of ADM. The mADM arm involved maintenance on a therapeutic ADM dose for the duration of follow-up. Interviewer-administered outcome measures assessed depressive symptoms and relapse/recurrence across 15-month follow-up. Mindfulness and self-compassion were measured using self-report questionnaire. Cognitive reactivity was operationalized as change in depressive thinking during a laboratory mood induction. MBCT's effects were mediated by enhancement of mindfulness and self-compassion across treatment. MBCT also changed the nature of the relationship between post-treatment cognitive reactivity and outcome. Greater reactivity predicted worse outcome for mADM participants but this relationship was not evident in the MBCT group. MBCT's treatment effects are mediated by augmented self-compassion and mindfulness, along with a decoupling of the relationship between reactivity of depressive thinking and poor outcome. This decoupling is associated with the cultivation of self-compassion across treatment.",

This qualitative study aims to explore working mechanisms and possible barriers of MBCT in this population. METHODS: Twelve participants of the trial were interviewed about their experiences. This was done before and after the MBCT course, and 12 months later. Written evaluations of participants and notes of participant observers were used for data-triangulation. RESULTS: In total, 35 qualitative interviews were conducted. MBCT initiated a process of change, starting with awareness of the present moment, the associated sensory experiences, thoughts and emotions and accepting rather than resisting these. Participants started to recognize their own behavioral patterns and change them, thus improving self-care. Self-compassion seemed to result from and facilitate this process. Main barriers were concurrent social problems and the inability or unwillingness to accept symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: MBCT can start a process of change in patients with persistent MUS. Awareness and acceptance of painful symptoms and emotions are key factors in this process. Change of unhelpful behavioral patterns and increased self-care and self-compassion can result from this process.",

The heavy cost burden of depression is probably due to treatment-resistant depression. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Method The present study was a quasi-experimental study conducted with twenty-four patients with treatment-resistant depression. Participants were selected by purposive sampling and randomly assigned to two groups, an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received MBCT and antidepressants, while the control group received antidepressants only. The Hamilton and Beck Depression Inventory, Self-Compassion Scale, Thought Rumination Scale, and Mindfulness Scale were administered. The treatment program was conducted in eight sessions; with a follow-up period of one month subsequent to treatment termination. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (analysis of variance for repeated measures and Bonferroni's post-hoc test). Results The results showed that MBCT significantly reduced depression and ruminative thinking in the experimental group and also improved mediators such as mindfulness and self-compassion. Patients maintained gains over the one month follow-up period (p < 0.01). Conclusion The present study provides additional evidence for the effectiveness of MBCT for TRD.",

Several studies have highlighted their feasibility, acceptance, and preliminary efficacy. However, this is an incipient field of research, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no data available from Spanish-speaking countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptance, and preliminary efficacy of the Internet Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (iABCT), a web-based version of the Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy, in Spanish speakers from the general population. METHODS: This feasibility study features a single-arm, uncontrolled, within-group design with an embedded qualitative and quantitative process evaluation at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up. A minimum of 35 participants from the general population will be allocated to iABCT. Feasibility measures will include attrition rate, patterns of use of the web-based system, and participants' acceptability, usability, and opinion. The primary outcome was measured using the Pemberton Happiness Index. Secondary outcomes were measured using the Compassion Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale-Short form, Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire, Relationships Questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire, Non-Attachment Scale, International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form, Purpose-In-Life Test, and difficulties regarding the practice of compassion (Compassion Practice Quality Questionnaire). Mixed models will be used to evaluate primary and secondary outcome measures. A qualitative content analysis of the participants' qualitative responses will also be performed. RESULTS: Enrollment started in February 2020 and will be finished in April 2020. Data analysis will start in October 2020. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will, for the first time, show data on the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of web-based compassion (and self-compassion) training-that is, the adapted iABCT-in Spanish speakers from the general population. Further aspects of their implementation (ie, facilitators, barriers, and unwanted effects) and mechanisms of change will be investigated.

BACKGROUND: The experience of cancer can have a negative impact on both psychological and physical health and on quality of life. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is a therapy package that has been used with patients with a variety of conditions. In order to draw conclusions on its effectiveness for cancer patients, the evidence requires systematic assessment. METHODS: A comprehensive search of major biomedical and specialist complementary medicine databases was conducted. Additionally, efforts were made to identify unpublished and ongoing research. Relevant research was categorized by study type and appraised according to study design. Clinical commentaries were obtained for each study and included in the review. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled clinical trials and seven uncontrolled clinical trials were found. A lack of relevant qualitative research studies was identified. Studies report positive results, including improvements in mood, sleep quality and reductions in stress. A dose-response effect has been observed between practice of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and improved outcome. A number of methodological limitations were identified. Modifications to the traditional Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programme make comparison between studies difficult and a lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusion on efficacy. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction has potential as a clinically valuable self-administered intervention for cancer patients. Further research into its efficacy, feasibility and safety for cancer patients in the nursing context is recommended.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness has come to be considered an important approach to help individuals cultivate transformative capacity to free themselves from stress and suffering. However, the transformative potential of mindfulness extends beyond individual stress management. This study contributes to a broadening of the scope of contemplative science by integrating the prominent, individually focused mindfulness meditation literature with collective mindfulness scholarship. In so doing, it aims to illuminate an important context in which mindfulness interventions are increasingly prevalent: workplaces. Typically, the intended effect of workplace mindfulness training is to help workers manage stress better. Since mindfulness in organizations impacts individual and collective processes, the study blends the above literatures to create a cross-level \"next-generation\" Team Mindfulness Training (TMT) pilot. Its potential in helping individuals and teams to manage work stress better is investigated via a two-phase mixed-methods research study in high-stress military work populations, and compared to a conventional (\"first-generation\") 8-week mindfulness meditation program based on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Results suggest that compared to the \"first-generation\" mindfulness program, TMT seems no less effective in raising individual stress management skills, and may hold more promise in generating collective capacity to manage stress and unexpected difficulty, linked to an apparent interdependence between collective and individual mindfulness capacity development. Based on these empirical results, the study contributes to theory in three important ways: first, it outlines how individual and collective mindfulness in workplaces may be interdependent. Second, it explains why \"next-generation\" workplace training interventions should apply a cross-level approach. And third, it illustrates how its transformative potential for people at work, individually as well as collectively, can be extended by moving beyond an inward-looking meditation focus in mindfulness training. The study contributes to practice by providing a detailed outline of the pilot TMT program, and offers a series of follow-up research opportunities to inspire further scientific innovation in workplace mindfulness training, especially for high-stress work populations. The study's ultimate aim is to prompt a shift away from adapting clinically oriented, self-focused \"first-generation\" mindfulness training protocols, and towards mindfulness as team sport: a more prosocially oriented mindfulness science intent on generating wisdom and compassion, for one and all.",

In the current study we investigated if Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) added to supported protocolized discontinuation (SPD) is more effective than SPD alone to help patients discontinue ADM. This study describes a prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial (completed). From 151 invited primary care practices in the Netherlands, 36 (24%) were willing to participate and randomly allocated to SPD+MBCT (k = 20) or SPD (k = 16). Adults using ADM > 9 months were invited by GPs to discuss tapering, followed by either MBCT+SPD, or SPD alone. Exclusion criteria included current psychiatric treatment; substance use disorder; non-psychiatric indication for ADM; attended MBCT within past 5 years; cognitive barriers. From the approximately 3000 invited patients, 276 responded, 119 participated in the interventions and 92 completed all assessments. All patients were offered a decision aid and a personalized tapering schedule (with GP). MBCT consisted of eight group sessions of 2.5 hours and one full day of practice. SPD was optional and consisted of consultations with a mental health assistant. Patients were assessed at baseline and 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up, non-blinded. In line with our protocol, primary outcome was full discontinuation of ADM within 6 months. Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, withdrawal symptoms, rumination, well-being, mindfulness skills, and self-compassion. Patients allocated to SPD + MBCT (n = 73) were not significantly more successful in discontinuing (44%) than those allocated to SPD (n = 46; 33%), OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.49, p = .24, number needed to treat = 9. Only 20/73 allocated to MBCT (27%) completed MBCT. No serious adverse events were reported. In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate a significant benefit of adding MBCT to SPD to support discontinuation in general practice. Actual participation in patient-tailored interventions was low, both for practices and for patients. (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov PRS ID: NCT03361514 registered December 2017).",

Thirty healthcare professionals participated in this non-randomized pre-post intervention pilot study. The questionnaire on mental health was filled in twice. Baseline and post-intervention differences were tested with paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

In comparison with baseline at post-intervention participants showed significant improvements in general mindfulness, the burnout dimension personal accomplishment, quality of sleep, positive emotions, and self-efficacy. A significant decrease was found in the burnout dimension emotional exhaustion, stress level, negative emotions at work, and worrying. No significant changes were found for the burnout dimension mental distance, and work engagement. The measures showed ample within-person differences and low, medium, or high effect sizes. The current trial approach of the MBSR training seems feasible and acceptable. Our results suggest that mindfulness, burnout, stress level, quality of sleep, positive emotions at work, negative emotions at work, self-efficacy, and worrying are meaningful mental health variables for inclusion in a larger-scale Randomized Controlled Trial on the effects of MBSR.",

DESIGN: Quantitative data were gathered as part of routine clinical practice within three adult psychiatric wards using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at admission and discharge and non-standardized Likert scales pre- and post-group sessions. METHOD: Between April and August 2017, the Acute Psychology Service (APS) gathered CORE-OM admission and discharge data from inpatients across three acute wards (n = 32) whilst 249 pre/post-group data sets were gathered from CFT group work undertaken on the inpatient wards. Current inpatients self-allocated to receive either CFT or TAU based on their desire for psychological involvement. Those self-allocating to receive psychological involvement (n = 19) were compared to those who did not (n = 13) across the four subdomains of the CORE-OM: Wellbeing, Functioning, Problem/Symptoms, and Risk. The Likert scales included subdomains to evaluate changes in self-compassion, compassion to others, and threat. Those receiving CFT group work also received TAU. RESULTS: Significant improvements to all CORE-OM subdomains were observed for those receiving CFT group input, in particular the Wellbeing and Functioning subdomains. Those receiving TAU only noted a significant improvement in the area of Risk whilst levels of Wellbeing were identical at admission and discharge with no improvements noted. Pre/post-group results indicated significant results for areas of self-compassion and compassion to others, whilst results by session for the threat subdomain are mixed dependant on session. Overall, all areas noted significant improvements. Session content was observed to be most effective for breathing and Mindfulness-based sessions and those utilizing imagery techniques. CONCLUSION: Compassion-Focused Therapy appears to be an effective group intervention for a trans-diagnostic population within adult inpatient settings. Patient outcomes are positively improved across a range of areas whilst undertaking psychological input in the form of CFT group work whilst also receiving TAU during an inpatient admission. The use of the CFT model to address trans-diagnostic difficulties supports targeting underlying psychological constructs in comparison to symptom treatment alone. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Compassion-focused therapy is a multi-model approach designed to target high levels of self-criticism. Previous research has demonstrated its effectiveness for a range of specific diagnosis; however, there is a limited research base with open groups and a trans-diagnostic population. Groups can be structured with standalone sessions to accommodate the unpredictable admissions and discharge patterns of acute psychiatric wards. Group sessions focused around Mindfulness and Imagery yielded the greatest significant improvements to pre-sessions scores. The provision of compassion-focused therapy groups within trans-diagnostic inpatient settings is feasible and has shown to significantly improve overall levels of distress and risk compared to those receiving treatment as usual. The lack of standardized Likert group measures limits the power of the study. Whilst a RCT would provide more reliable data, this was not possible as part of routine clinical practice for ethical reasons.",

OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of psychosocial group interventions for improving the psychological well-being of adults living with HIV/AIDS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases up to 14 March 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2016), PubMed (MEDLINE) (1996 to 14 March 2016), Embase (1996 to 14 March 2016), and Clinical Trials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared psychosocial group interventions with versus control (standard care or brief educational interventions), with at least three months follow-up post-intervention. We included trials that reported measures of depression, anxiety, stress, or coping using standardized scales. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened abstracts, applied the inclusion criteria, and extracted data. We compared continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and pooled data using a random-effects model. When the included trials used different measurement scales, we pooled data using standardized mean difference (SMD) values. We reported trials that we could not include in the meta analysis narratively in the text. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 trials (19 articles) that enrolled 2520 adults living with HIV. All the interventions were multifaceted and included a mix of psychotherapy, relaxation, group support, and education. The included trials were conducted in the USA (12 trials), Canada (one trial), Switzerland (one trial), Uganda (one trial), and South Africa (one trial), and published between 1996 and 2016. Ten trials recruited men and women, four trials recruited homosexual men, and two trials recruited women only. Interventions were conducted with groups of four to 15 people, for 90 to 135 minutes, every week for up to 12 weeks. All interventions were conducted face-to-face except two, which were delivered by telephone. All were delivered by graduate or postgraduate trained health, psychology, or social care professionals except one that used a lay community health worker and two that used trained mindfulness practitioners.Group-based psychosocial interventions based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may have a small effect on measures of depression, and this effect may last for up to 15 months after participation in the group sessions (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.10; 1139 participants, 10 trials, low certainty evidence). Most trials used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which has a maximum score of 63, and the mean score in the intervention groups was around 1.4 points lower at the end of follow-up. This small benefit was consistent across five trials where participants had a mean depression score in the normal range at baseline, but trials where the mean score was in the depression range at baseline effects were less consistent. Fewer trials reported measures of anxiety, where there may be little or no effect (four trials, 471 participants, low certainty evidence), stress, where there may be little or no effect (five trials, 507 participants, low certainty evidence), and coping (five trials, 697 participants, low certainty evidence).Group-based interventions based on mindfulness have not demonstrated effects on measures of depression (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.03; 233 participants, 2 trials, very low certainty evidence), anxiety (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.15; 62 participants, 2 trials, very low certainty evidence), or stress (MD -2.02, 95% CI -4.23 to 0.19; 137 participants, 2 trials, very low certainty evidence). No mindfulness based interventions included in the studies had any valid measurements of coping. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Group-based psychosocial interventions may have a small effect on measures of depression, but the clinical importance of this is unclear. More high quality evidence is needed to assess whether group psychosocial intervention improve psychological well-being in HIV positive adults.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) and homecare unit professionals are susceptible to higher levels of stress and burnout than other healthcare professionals, which has an impact on their well-being, and in turn on their patients. In terms of data, there is not much research about the effects of psychological interventions on ICU and homecare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Wellbeing Training based on Contemplative Practices (WTCP) for the increase of psychological functioning in a sample of ICU and homecare professionals. METHODS: A pilot and feasibility non-randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants in the WTCP group (n = 19) attended an at-work 8-session/2 h group WTCP program aimed at directly training four basic skills: (a) sustained positive emotions, (b) recovery from negative emotions, (c) pro-social behavior and generosity, and (d) mind wandering, mindfulness, and \"affective stickiness\". Nineteen professionals were allocated in the control group. RESULTS: Results indicated that WTCP had a positive impact on self-compassion, personal accomplishment (burnout), and frequency of negative emotions. Moreover, a thematic analysis of participant interviews (n = 14) was conducted. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are promising, though future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of WTCP using randomized controlled trial methodologies.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore mediated effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy-\"Taking it Further\" (MBCT-TiF) on mental well-being through changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering. METHOD: A secondary analysis of an RCT using simple mediation, with 164 graduates of MBCT and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), was implemented whereby MBCT-TiF (vs ongoing mindfulness practice; OMP) was the independent variable; changes in mindfulness, self-compassion, and decentering during the intervention were the mediators; and mental well-being at post-intervention, whilst controlling for baseline, was the dependent variable. Secondary outcomes included psychological quality of life, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Compared to OMP, MBCT-TiF experienced significant improvements in mental well-being through changes in all three mediators (mindfulness: ab = 0.11 [0.03, 0.25]; decentering: ab = 0.16 [0.05, 0.33]; self-compassion: ab = 0.07 [0.01, 0.18]). A similar pattern was demonstrated for depression, but only mindfulness and decentering mediated effects on psychological quality of life and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The findings provide preliminary support for all three mediators in driving change in mental well-being in a sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates. Future work must be theory-driven and powered to test all mediators in parallel and alongside other potential mediators (e.g., equanimity) to further understand independent contributions and interacting effects.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05154266.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness meditation is likely to promote better management of stress, pain and negative emotions. We propose to address the benefit of meditation in an open setting associating people with cancer (target population), medical staff and witnesses (neither patient nor medical staff). This study aims (1) to evaluate the effects of meditation on wellness improvement and (2) to identify criteria and modalities for a subsequent randomised study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We propose a longitudinal pilot study consisting of a non-randomised experimental preintervention/postintervention survey. The intervention consists in delivering a meditation programme (12 weekly meditation sessions of 1.5 hours each), specifically adapted to our target population and addressing our research hypothesis in an open setting involving people with cancer, medical staff and witnesses (equally distributed in two groups of 15 participants). The main objective is to evaluate participants' adherence to the programme. The effects of meditation will be evaluated on stress, quality of life, feeling of personal effectiveness, on the development of mindfulness and empathy, and on satisfaction and perception of a change in quality of life. We will also measure the putative added value of 'meditating together'. This study is expected to allow validating the evaluation tools and refining the modalities of the workshops. We expect to demonstrate the evolution that this meditation-based intervention induces in the participants. We aim to promote bridge-building, between patients, medical staff but also others. In this way, one's own suffering may be understood in the light of others' suffering, thereby promoting the sense of otherness and giving insights into 'living better with'. This exploratory study will investigate the relevance of this hypothesis, which could then be explored by a randomised study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (Comite de Protection des Personnes Est II). Trial findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Major depression is a common psychiatric disorder, frequently taking a chronic course. Despite provision of evidence-based treatments, including antidepressant medication and psychological treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy, a substantial amount of patients do not recover. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been found to be effective in reducing relapse in recurrent depression, as well as lowering symptom levels in acute depression. The effectiveness of MBCT for chronic, treatment-resistant depression has only be studied in a few pilot trials. A large randomized controlled trial is necessary to examine the effectiveness of MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in chronic, treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized-controlled trial is conducted to compare MBCT with treatment-as-usual (TAU). Patients with chronic, treatment-resistant depression who have received antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy are included. Assessments take place at baseline and post intervention/TAU-period. The primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes are: remission rates, quality of life, rumination, mindfulness skills and self-compassion. Patients in the TAU condition are offered to participate in the MBCT after the post TAU-period assessment. From all completers of the MBCT (MBCT condition and patients participating after the TAU-period), follow-up assessments are taken at three and six months after the completion of the MBCT. DISCUSSION: This trial will result in valuable information about the effectiveness of MBCT in chronic, treatment-resistant depressed patients who previously received antidepressant medication and psychological treatment.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Psychosocial interventions that mitigate psychosocial distress in cancer patients are important. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an adaptation of the Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) program among adult cancer patients. A secondary aim was to examine pre-post-program changes in psychosocial wellbeing. METHOD: The research design was a feasibility and acceptability study, with an examination of pre- to post-intervention changes in psychosocial measures. A study information pack was posted to 173 adult cancer patients 6 months-5 years post-diagnosis, with an invitation to attend an eight-week group-based adaptation of the MSC program. RESULTS: Thirty-two (19%) consented to the program, with 30 commencing. Twenty-seven completed the program (mean age: 62.93 years, SD 14.04; 17 [63%] female), attending a mean 6.93 (SD 1.11) group sessions. There were no significant differences in medico-demographic factors between program-completers and those who did not consent. However, there was a trend toward shorter time since diagnosis in the program-completers group. Program-completers rated the program highly regarding content, relevance to the concerns of cancer patients, and the likelihood of recommending the program to other cancer patients. Sixty-three percent perceived that their mental wellbeing had improved from pre- to post-program; none perceived a deterioration in mental wellbeing. Small-to-medium effects were observed for depressive symptoms, fear of cancer recurrence, stress, loneliness, body image satisfaction, mindfulness, and self-compassion. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The MSC program appears feasible and acceptable to adults diagnosed with non-advanced cancer. The preliminary estimates of effect sizes in this sample suggest that participation in the program was associated with improvements in psychosocial wellbeing. Collectively, these findings suggest that there may be value in conducting an adequately powered randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the MSC program in enhancing the psychosocial wellbeing of cancer patients.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress, promote health, and well-being, as well as to increase compassionate behavior toward others. It reduces distress to one's own painful experiences, going along with altered neural responses, by enhancing self-regulatory processes and decreasing emotional reactivity. In order to investigate if mindfulness similarly reduces distress and neural activations associated with empathy for others' socially painful experiences, which might in the following more strongly motivate prosocial behavior, the present study compared trait, and state effects of long-term mindfulness meditation (LTM) practice. To do so we acquired behavioral data and neural activity measures using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an empathy for social pain task while manipulating the meditation state between two groups of LTM practitioners that were matched with a control group. The results show increased activations of the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as the medial prefrontal cortex and temporal pole when sharing others' social suffering, both in LTM practitioners and controls. However, in LTM practitioners, who practiced mindfulness meditation just prior to observing others' social pain, left AI activation was lower and the strength of AI activation following the mindfulness meditation was negatively associated with trait compassion in LTM practitioners. The findings suggest that current mindfulness meditation could provide an adaptive mechanism in coping with distress due to the empathic sharing of others' suffering, thereby possibly enabling compassionate behavior.

Previous studies have reported positive effects of a structured 8-week group mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) among patients with cancer and other conditions. PURPOSE: To test the effect of such a programme on anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer in a population-based randomised controlled study. METHODS: A total of 336 women who had been operated on for breast cancer (stage I-III) were randomised to usual care or MBSR+usual care. Questionnaires including the Symptom Checklist-90r anxiety and depression subscales and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale were administered before randomisation and immediately, 6 and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses showed differences between groups in levels of anxiety (p=0.0002) and depression (SCL-90r, p<0.0001; CES-D, p=0.0367) after 12 months. Graphical comparisons of participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline showed a significantly greater decrease in the intervention group throughout follow-up and no differences among least affected participants. Medium-to-large effects were found for all outcomes in the intervention group in analyses of change scores after 12 months' follow-up. CONCLUSION: The 8-week group based MBSR intervention had clinically meaningful, statistically significant effects on depression and anxiety after 12 months' follow-up, and medium-to-large effect sizes.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common and distressing problem after stroke. The best ways to prevent or treat PSF are uncertain. Several different interventions can be argued to have a rational basis. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether, among people with stroke, any intervention reduces the proportion of people with fatigue, fatigue severity, or both; and to determine the effect of intervention on health-related quality of life, disability, dependency and death, and whether such intervention is cost effective. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched May 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2014), EMBASE (1980 to May 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014), AMED (1985 to May 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2014), Digital Dissertations (1861 to May 2014), British Nursing Index (1985 to May 2014), PEDro (searched May 2014) and PsycBITE (searched May 2014). We also searched four ongoing trials registries, scanned reference lists, performed citation tracking of included trials and contacted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors independently scrutinised all titles and abstracts and excluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full texts for potentially relevant studies and three review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an intervention with a control, or compared different interventions for PSF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. The primary outcomes were severity of fatigue, or proportion of people with fatigue after treatment. We performed separate analyses for trials investigating efficacy in treating PSF, trials investigating efficacy in preventing PSF and trials not primarily investigating efficacy in PSF but which reported fatigue as an outcome. We pooled results from trials that had a control arm. For trials that compared different potentially active interventions without a control arm, we performed analyses for individual trials without pooling.We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) as the effect size for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled the results using a random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We performed separate subgroup analyses for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. We also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved 12,490 citations, obtained full texts for 58 studies and included 12 trials (three from the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 participants. Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions: a fatigue education programme and a mindfulness-based stress reduction programme). The fatigue severity was lower in the intervention groups than in the control groups (244 participants, pooled SMD -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.93 to -0.21), with significant heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 87%, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value < 0.00001). The beneficial effect was not seen in trials that had used adequate allocation concealment (two trials, 89 participants, SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.04) or trials that had used adequate blinding of outcome assessors (four trials, 198 participants, SMD -1.10, 95% CI -2.31 to 0.11).No trial primarily investigated the efficacy in preventing PSF.Four trials (248 participants) did not primarily investigate the efficacy on fatigue but other symptoms after stroke. None of these interventions showed any benefit on reducing PSF, which included tirilazad mesylate, continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnoea, antidepressants and a self management programme for recovery from chronic diseases. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was insufficient evidence on the efficacy of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue after stroke. Trials to date have been small and heterogeneous, and some have had a high risk of bias. Some of the interventions described were feasible in people with stroke, but their efficacy should be investigated in RCTs with a more robust study design and adequate sample sizes.",

Studies were retrieved from bibliographic databases, databases of funded research, and reference sections of relevant articles. Studies that (a) evaluated a CIH approach to promote chronic pain management among military personnel, (b) used a randomized controlled trial design, and (c) assessed pain intensity were included. Two coders extracted data from each study and calculated effect sizes. Discrepancies between coders were resolved through discussion. Comprehensive searches identified 12 studies (k = 15 interventions) that met inclusion criteria. CIH practices included cognitive-behavioral therapies (k = 5), positive psychology (k = 3), yoga (k = 2), acupuncture (k = 2), mindfulness-based interventions (k = 2), and biofeedback (k = 1). Across these studies, participants who received the intervention reported greater reductions in pain intensity (d+ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.21, 0.67], k = 15) compared to controls. Statistically significant improvements were also observed for physical functioning (d+ = 0.36, 95% CI [0.11, 0.61], k = 11) but not for depressive symptoms (d+ = 0.21, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.57], k = 8). CIH approaches reduced pain intensity and improved physical functioning. These approaches offer a nonpharmacological, nonsurgical intervention for chronic pain management for military personnel. Future studies should optimize interventions to improve depressive symptoms in military populations experiencing chronic pain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",

Its beneficial effects are still challenging to determine due to the heterogeneity and methodological obstacles regarding medical applications. This study aimed to integrate the features of therapeutic meditation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs with meditation for populations with diseases using the PubMed database through June 2021. We analyzed the characteristics of the diseases/disorders, participants, measurements, and their overall benefits. RESULTS: Among a total of 4855 references, 104 RCTs were determined and mainly applied mindfulness-based (51 RCTs), yoga-based (32 RCTs), and transcendental meditation (14 RCTs) to 10,139 patient-participants. These RCTs were conducted for participants with a total of 45 kinds of disorders; the most frequent being cancer, followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases and affective mood disorder. Seven symptoms or signs were frequently assessed: depressive mood, feeling anxious, quality of life, stress, sleep, pain, and fatigue. The RCTs showed a higher ratio of positive outcomes for sleep (73.9%) and fatigue (68.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review produced the comprehensive features of RCTs for therapeutic meditation.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Many people with psychotic experiences do not develop psychotic disorders, yet those who seek help demonstrate high clinical complexity and poor outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with psychotic experiences. METHOD: We searched 13 databases for studies of psychological interventions for adults with psychotic experiences, but not psychotic disorders. Our outcomes were the proportion of participants remitting from psychotic experiences (primary); changes in positive and negative psychotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, functioning, distress, and quality of life; and economic outcomes (secondary). We analysed results using multilevel random-effects meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 27 reports met inclusion criteria. In general, there was no strong evidence for the superiority of any one intervention. Five studies reported on our primary outcome, though only two reports provided randomised controlled trial evidence that psychological intervention (specifically, cognitive behavioural therapy) promoted remission from psychotic experiences. For secondary outcomes, we could only meta-analyse trials of cognitive behavioural therapy. We found that cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than treatment as usual for reducing distress (pooled standardised mean difference: -0.24; 95% confidence interval = [-0.37, -0.10]), but no more effective than the control treatment for improving any other outcome. Individual reports indicated that cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, sleep cognitive behavioural therapy, systemic therapy, cognitive remediation therapy, and supportive treatments improved at least one clinical or functional outcome. Four reports included economic evaluations, which suggested cognitive behavioural therapy may be cost-effective compared with treatment as usual. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analytic findings were primarily null, with the exception that cognitive behavioural therapy may reduce the distress associated with psychotic experiences. Our analyses were limited by scarcity of studies, small samples and variable study quality. Several intervention frameworks showed preliminary evidence of positive outcomes; however, the paucity of consistent evidence for clinical and functional improvement highlights a need for further research into psychological treatments for psychotic experiences.

            "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the role of mindfulness and mindfulness-based interventions to optimize recovery from a substance use disorder (SUD). However, relatively little is known about the theory-based psychological and social pathways whereby mindfulness could have beneficial effects for managing a chronic, relapsing SUD. Informed by Revised Stress and Coping Theory, the present cross-sectional study examined affective, cognitive, and social pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. A total of 161 HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using sexual minority men completed a screening visit for a randomized controlled trial. Using a hybrid structural equation model, we examined pathways whereby mindfulness is associated with lower methamphetamine craving. We found that greater mindfulness was directly associated with lower negative affect and higher positive affect as well as indirectly associated with less methamphetamine craving. Interestingly, the indirect association between mindfulness and methamphetamine craving appeared to be uniquely attributable to positive affect. Only positive affect was indirectly associated with lower methamphetamine craving via higher positive re-appraisal coping and greater self-efficacy for managing triggers for methamphetamine use. Methamphetamine craving was supported by moderate associations with greater substance use severity and more frequent methamphetamine use. These findings support the role of mindfulness in cultivating positive affect, which could be crucial to build the capacity of individuals to manage methamphetamine craving as a chronic stressor that threatens recovery from SUD.",

            "title": "Psychological therapies for preventing seasonal affective disorder.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of psychological therapy, light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full-text review for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of blinding.The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45- to 60-minute sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR, range 0-90) from September 2011 to mid-April 2012. The incidence of a new depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS-SR \u2265 20), compared to 74% of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence).For participants with depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups. Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS-SR, and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI -3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality-evidence).The overall discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence).Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision.Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We aimed to estimate the effect of mindfulness therapy on mental health. METHODS: Two researchers searched 12 databases to identify relevant trials that were published from 1 January 2018 to 1 May 2023. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of mindfulness therapy on depression, which was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS); anxiety, which was measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), PROMIS, and DASS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); stress, which was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), DASS, and GAD-7; mindfulness, which was measured by the GAD-7, Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Short Form-12 Mental Component Score (SF-12 MCS) and Short Form-12 Physical Component Score (SF-12 PCS); and sleep quality, which was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). After screening studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,824 participants were ultimately included. RESULTS: All these studies demonstrated positive effects of mindfulness therapy on depression (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI: [-0.44, -0.22], p < 0.00001, I2 = 29%), anxiety (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI: [-0.46, -0.25], p < 0.00001, I2 = 40%), stress (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: [-0.48, -0.29], p < 0.00001, I2 = 69%) and sleep quality scores (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI: [-1.54, -0.09], p = 0.03, I2 = 0%). However, there was no significant difference in mindfulness (SMD = -0.12, 95% CI: [-0.36, -0.12], p = 0.34, I2 = 34%) between the mindfulness therapy group and the control group. DISCUSSION: In future studies, it is necessary to consider the investigation on whether the strategies of improving the mindfulness therapy in adherence and fidelity can work on the improvement of the outcomes in mental health.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been adopted as an evidence-based treatment for unipolar depressive disorder (UDD). Although MBCT has not been included in the treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder (BD), MBCT is regularly being offered to patients with BD in routine clinical practice. In this pilot study we used routine outcome monitoring (ROM) data to explore whether there are indications that patients with BD might benefit less from MBCT than patients with UDD in terms of feasibility and effectiveness. METHODS: The study population consisted of patients with BD (n = 30) or UDD (n = 501) who received MBCT at the Radboudumc Centre for Mindfulness in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Patients completed self-report measures of depressive symptom severity, worry, well-being, mindfulness skills and self-compassion pre- and post MBCT as part of the ROM. RESULTS: There were significant less patients with BD who decided to start MBCT after intake than patients with UDD. No differences in dropout between groups were found. Results showed significant moderate to large improvements in both groups after MBCT, while no differences between groups were found, on all outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there are no indications that MBCT, when delivered in heterogeneous patient groups in routine clinical practice, is less beneficial for patients with BD than patients with UDD in terms of feasibility and effectiveness. This lends support to conduct an adequately powered RCT to examine the (cost-)effectiveness of MBCT in BD as the next step before implementing MBCT on a larger scale in patients with BD.",

DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid Medline, Ovid EMBASE, PsycINFO, Ovid Cochrane and WHO Clinical Trials Registry in order to identify any controlled trials or randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of interventions aimed at improving psychological resilience. Pooled effects sizes were calculated using the random-effects model of meta-analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Valid and reliable measures of psychological resilience. RESULTS: Overall, 437 citations were retrieved and 111 peer-reviewed articles were examined in full. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria and were subject to a quality assessment, with 11 RCTs being included in the final meta-analysis. Programmes were stratified into one of three categories (1) cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions, (2) mindfulness-based interventions or (3) mixed Interventions, those combining CBT and Mindfulness training. A meta-analysis found a moderate positive effect of resilience interventions (0.44 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.64) with subgroup analysis suggesting CBT-based, mindfulness and mixed interventions were effective.

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Positive effects have been reported after mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in diverse clinical and nonclinical populations. Primary care is a key health care setting for addressing common chronic conditions, and an effective MBI designed for this setting could benefit countless people worldwide. Meta-analyses of MBIs have become popular, but little is known about their efficacy in primary care. Our aim was to investigate the application and efficacy of MBIs that address primary care patients. METHODS: We performed a meta-analytic review of randomized controlled trials addressing the effect of MBIs in adult patients recruited from primary care settings. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and Cochrane guidelines were followed. Effect sizes were calculated with the Hedges g in random effects models. RESULTS: The meta-analyses were based on 6 trials having a total of 553 patients. The overall effect size of MBI compared with a control condition for improving general health was moderate (g = 0.48; P = .002), with moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 59; P <.05). We found no indication of publication bias in the overall estimates. MBIs were efficacious for improving mental health (g = 0.56; P = .007), with a high heterogeneity (I(2) = 78; P <.01), and for improving quality of life (g = 0.29; P = .002), with a low heterogeneity (I(2) = 0; P >.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of randomized controlled trials applying MBIs in primary care is still limited, our results suggest that these interventions are promising for the mental health and quality of life of primary care patients. We discuss innovative approaches for implementing MBIs, such as complex intervention and stepped care.",

This review assessed the evidence regarding the effects of mindfulness meditation for primary headache pain. METHODS: Only English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [the Cochrane Library], PsycINFO, Psychology and behavioral science collection, PsyArticles, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched from their inception to November 2016 with the keywords (\"meditation\" or \"mindfulness\" or \"vipassana\" or \"dzogchen\" or \"zen\" or \"integrative body-mind training\" or \"IBMT\" or \"mindfulness-based stress reduction\" or \"MBSR\" or \"mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\" or \"MBCT\" and \"Headache\" or \"Head pain\" or \"Cephalodynia\" or \"Cephalalgia\" or \"Hemicrania\" or \"Migraine\"). Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened against study inclusion criteria: controlled trials of structured meditation programs for adult patients with primary headache pain. The quality of studies included in the meta-analysis was assessed with the Yates Quality Rating Scale. The meta-analysis was conducted with Revman 5.3. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials and one controlled clinical trial with a combined study population of 315 patients were included in the study. When compared to control group data, mindfulness meditation induced significant improvement in pain intensity (standardized mean difference, -0.89; 95% confidence interval, -1.63 to -0.15; P = 0.02) and headache frequency (-0.67; -1.24 to -0.10; P = 0.02). In a subgroup analysis of different meditation forms, mindfulness-based stress reduction displayed a significant positive influence on pain intensity (P < 0.000). Moreover, 8-week intervention had a significant positive effect (P < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness meditation may reduce pain intensity and is a promising treatment option for patients. Clinicians may consider mindfulness meditation as a viable complementary and alternative medical option for primary headache.",

            "abstract": "Meditation-based mind-body therapies (yoga, tai-chi, qi-gong, mindfulness) have been suggested to have a potential therapeutic effect on negative symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining effectiveness of yoga, tai-chi, qi-gong and mindfulness on negative symptoms of schizophrenia, using different databases and trial registries. The primary outcome was effect of mind-body therapies on negative symptoms and the secondary outcome was effect on positive symptoms. Fifteen RCTs were included in the meta-analysis (N = 1081 patients). Overall, we found a beneficial effect of mind-body interventions on negative symptoms at endpoint compared to treatment-as-usual or non-specific control interventions, but the effect was small and moderate to high heterogeneity was present. A subgroup analysis for different types of therapy revealed a significant effect of mindfulness-based and yoga interventions on negative symptoms, but heterogeneity within the yoga subgroup was high. Our results did not show an increase of positive symptoms (N = 1051). Our results suggest a potential for meditation-based mind-body therapies in the treatment of negative symptoms, in particular for mindfulness based approaches and to a lesser extent yoga. Limitations in the available comparisons do not allow concluding on a specific effect of these interventions. Overall, the currently available evidence remains limited and does not yet allow one to recommend mind-body therapies for the reduction of negative symptoms. However, the present findings justify further research on mind-body therapies for the treatment of negative symptoms.",

Evidence shows mindfulness-based interventions may reduce blood pressure and improve mental health. However, the effect of mindfulness-based interventions on blood pressure and mental health has not been fully understood. METHODS: Potential studies published before May 24th 2023 were identified by searching Embase, Ovid Emcare, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, and VIP China Science. Additionally, two grey databases were searched: Mednar, WorldWideScience.org. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool. The random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using Review Man 5.4 software and the key outcomes are presented as mean difference or standard mean difference and the 95% confidential interval. RESULTS: Searches returned 802 studies in total, of which 12 were included (N = 715). The duration of interventions was 8 weeks in 10 trials and 6 weeks in one trial. Pooled effect sizes indicated reductions in systolic blood pressure (MD = - 9.12, 95% CI [- 12.18, - 6.05], p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (MD = - 5.66, 95% CI [- 8.88, - 2.43], p < 0.001), anxiety (SMD = - 4.10; 95% CI [- 6.49, - 1.71], p < 0.001), depression (SMD = - 1.70, 95%CI [- 2.95, - 0.44], p < 0.001) and perceived stress (SMD = - 5.91, 95%CI [- 8.74, - 3.09], p < 0.001) at post-intervention. The findings from subgroup analyses are favorable for mindfulness-based interventions regardless of gender and baseline blood pressure with regard to BP reduction, with a more profound effect observed in participants with higher pre-intervention blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence for the positive role of mindfulness-based interventions in hypertension management.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dutch teachers in secondary vocational schools suffer from stress and burnout complaints that can cause considerable problems at work. This paper presents a study design that can be used to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a person-focused intervention, both within and outside of the context of an additional organisational health intervention. METHODS: The proposed study comprises a cluster randomised controlled trial that will be conducted in at least three secondary vocational schools, to which teachers will be recruited from three types of courses: Care, Technology, and Economy. The allocation of the intervention programme to the participating schools will be randomised. The teachers from each school will be assigned to intervention group 1 (IG 1), intervention group 2 (IG 2), or the waiting list group (WG). IG 1 will receive MBSR training and IG 2 will receive MBSR training combined with an additional organisational health intervention. WG, that is the control group, will receive MBSR training one year later. The primary outcome variable of the proposed study is mindfulness, which will be measured using the Dutch version of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-NL). In the conceptual model, the effects of teachers' mindfulness resulting from the intervention programmes (MBSR training and MBSR training combined with an additional organisational health intervention) will be related to salient (secondary outcome) variables: mental health outcomes (e.g., burnout, work engagement), work performance, work-related perceptions (job demands and job resources), and personal competencies (e.g., occupational self-efficacy). Data will be collected before (T(0)) and immediately after the MBSR training (T(1)), and 3 (T(2)) and 9 months (T(3)) after the training. The power analysis revealed a required sample size of 66 teachers (22 in each group). DISCUSSION: The proposed study aims to provide insight into (1) the short-term and long-term effects of MBSR on teachers' mental health, (2) the possible enhancing effects of the additional organisational health intervention, and (3) the teachers' experiences with the interventions (working mechanisms, steps in the mindfulness change process). Strengths of this study design are the use of both positive and negative outcomes, the wide range of outcomes, both outcome and process measures, longitudinal data, mixed methods, and an integral approach. Although the proposed study protocol may not address all weaknesses of current studies (e.g., self-selection bias, self-reporting of data, the Hawthorne effect), it is innovative in many ways and can be expected to make important contributions to both the scientific and practical debate on how to beat work-related stress and occupational burnout, and on how to enhance work engagement and work performance.

            "title": "Application of Positive Psychology in Digital Interventions for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Trials.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of mental health issues in children, adolescents, and young adults has become an escalating public health issue, impacting approximately 10%-20% of young people on a global scale. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) can act as powerful mental health promotion tools to reach wide-ranging audiences that might otherwise be challenging to access. This increased access would enable prevention of mental disorders and promotion of widespread well-being by enhancing self-efficacy, thereby supporting the achievement of tangible objectives. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a comprehensive synthesis of all randomized controlled trials and controlled trials involving children, adolescents, and young adults, encompassing both clinical and nonclinical populations, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of digital PPIs in this age group. METHODS: After a literature search in 9 electronic databases until January 12, 2023, and gray literature until April 2023, we carried out a systematic review of 35 articles, of which 18 (51%) provided data for the meta-analysis. We included randomized controlled trials and controlled trials mainly based on web-based, digital, or smartphone-based interventions using a positive psychology framework as the main component. Studies included participants with a mean age of <35 years. Outcomes of PPIs were classified into indicators of well-being (compassion, life satisfaction, optimism, happiness, resilience, emotion regulation and emotion awareness, hope, mindfulness, purpose, quality of life, gratitude, empathy, forgiveness, motivation, and kindness) and ill-being (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and burnout). PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used for the selection of studies and data extraction. Quality assessment was performed following the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. RESULTS: For well-being outcomes, meta-analytic results showed that PPIs augmented the feeling of purpose, gratitude, and hope (Hedges g=0.555), compassion (Hedges g=0.447), positive coping behaviors (Hedges g=0.421), body image-related outcomes (Hedges g=0.238), and positive mindset predisposition (Hedges g=0.304). For ill-being outcomes, PPIs reduced cognitive biases (Hedges g=-0.637), negative emotions and mood (Hedges g=-0.369), and stress levels (Hedges g=-0.342). Of note, larger effect sizes were found when a waiting list control group was considered versus a digital control group. A funnel plot showed no publication bias. Meta-regression analyses showed that PPIs tended to show a larger effect size on well-being outcomes in studies including young adults, whereas no specific effect was found for ill-being outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Revised evidence suggests that PPIs benefit young people's well-being and mitigate ill-being symptoms. Digital platforms offer a unique way to address their mental health challenges, although not without limitations. Future research should explore how they work for the needs of the young population and further examine what specific PPIs or combination of interventions is most beneficial with respect to other digital control groups.

            "abstract": "CONTEXT: Pain is the most fearful symptom in cancer. Although there is a relationship between psychosocial variables and oncologic pain, psychological and non-pharmacological treatments for pain management in cancer patients are not very widespread. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the efficacy of psychological and non-pharmacological treatments for reducing pain in cancer patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review following the PRISMA protocol. In January 2021, data were extracted from PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, including randomised controlled trials (RCT) published in the last five years (from 28 January, 2015 to December 15, 2020), in the English language and whose sample was patients with cancer pain. The database search used the following keywords: cancer, cancer-related pain, psychological intervention, non-pharmacologic intervention. The Cochrane risk of bias assess ment for randomised trials (RoB 2) was used for quality appraisal. RESULTS: After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, ten papers were fully screened. The evidence suggested that the most effective interventions to reduce cancer pain were mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation and emotional and symptom focused engagement (EASE). Music therapy and brief cognitive behavioral strategies (CBS) require more research, while coping skills training and yoga did not show positive effects. Overall, we obtained a moderate size effect (d = 0.642, 95% CI: 0.125-1.158) favourable to psychological and non-pharmacologic treatments at post-treatment, which increased at follow-up (k = 5, d = 0.826, 95% CI: 0.141-1.511). CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into psychological interventions which might be applied and contribute to cancer-related pain reduction in adults. Although the results are not completely consistent, they may shed light on psychology applications in the oncology environment.",

            "abstract": "Interoception, or the process of sensing, interpreting, and integrating internal bodily signals, has increasingly been the subject of scientific research over the past decade but is still not well known in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to review clinical treatment interventions that use interoception, to synthesize the current research knowledge, and to identify the gaps where future research is needed. We conducted a comprehensive literature search on randomized, controlled trials that both include interoception in treatment interventions for individuals with psychiatric disorders and measure aspects of interoception using self-report measures. Out of 14 randomized, controlled trials identified, 7 found that interventions with interoception were effective in ameliorating symptoms. These studies included individuals with anxiety disorders, eating disorders, psychosomatic disorders, and addictive disorders. All of the intervention studies with positive clinical outcomes also demonstrated changes on interoceptive measures; however, these measures were often related to specific illness symptoms. Interoception may be a mechanism of action in improving clinical symptomatology, though studies incorporating general, symptom-independent interoceptive measures remain scarce. To further our understanding of the role interoception has in psychiatric disorders and their treatment, more studies integrating interoceptive measures are needed, along with a clearer definition of interoceptive terms used.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This protocol is for a feasibility study of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program adapted for pregnant women with psychosocial vulnerabilities. The rationale for the study is the need for a wider array of evidence-based options to address prenatal mental health care needs in pregnant women. MBSR is a promising mental health intervention but has not yet been adapted for pregnant women with the aim of addressing prenatal mental health. The purpose is thus to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of an adapted MBSR program, prenatal MBSR, compared to usual care to inform a randomized controlled trial. METHODS/DESIGN: Pregnant women (n = 60) referred to an outpatient clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark, will be recruited for the study. The design is a single-center feasibility trial, with prenatal MBSR, as an add-on to usual care. The primary outcome is to assess the feasibility of a full-scale randomized controlled trial. The secondary feasibility outcome includes possible effects of the adapted MBSR program estimated by self-report questionnaires measuring stress, anxiety, depression, well-being, decentering, reflective functioning, mindfulness, and compassion. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to prenatal MBSR or usual care. DISCUSSION: The study is part of the Good Start to Family Life study anchored at Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark. Teaching the skills of mindfulness meditation to a psychosocially vulnerable group of pregnant women could prove a viable and non-pharmacological approach to reduce stress, improve mental health, and provide support in the transition to parenthood. The outcomes of the feasibility study will inform the design of a fully powered randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04571190 . Registered on September 30, 2020.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: University students are expressing an increased need for mental health support. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are being integrated into university stress-reduction programmes globally. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing MBI effects on university students' mental and physical health. METHODS: We searched nine databases, including grey literature and trial registries. Two independent reviewers extracted data following a prospective public protocol. RESULTS: Fifty-one RCTs were included. In comparison with passive controls, and when measured shortly after intervention completion, MBIs improve distress, anxiety, depression, well-being, rumination, and mindfulness with small to moderate effect sizes, with no benefit found for blood pressure, sleep, life satisfaction, resilience, worry, and thought suppression. Evidence for self-compassion is inconclusive. Effects last beyond three months for distress and mindfulness, with no data on other outcomes. Compared with active control groups, MBIs significantly improve distress and state anxiety, but not mindfulness, depression, well-being, affect, trait anxiety, or emotion regulation. Results were robust to adjustment for multiple testing, but RCTs' risk of bias is generally high. Moderator analyses did not find differential intervention effects according to intervention duration, delivery mode, or sub-populations. CONCLUSIONS: MBIs may be helpful to students but higher-quality research is needed.",

            "abstract": "The potential health benefits of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion are well-documented. However, interventions that teach these principles typically rely on face-to-face delivery, which can limit their dissemination. Delivering these interventions through smartphone apps could help overcome this. This meta-analysis examined whether principles of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion can be learned through smartphone apps. Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials were included. Smartphone apps that included acceptance and/or mindfulness components resulted in significantly higher levels of acceptance/mindfulness than comparison conditions (k = 33; g = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.17, 0.41). These effects were moderated by the type of comparison and whether reminders to engage were offered. Smartphone apps also resulted in significantly lower levels of psychological distress than comparisons (k = 22; g = -0.32; 95% CI = -0.48, -0.16). Meta-regression revealed a negative relationship between the effect sizes for mindfulness/acceptance and the effect sizes for distress. Smartphone apps produced significantly greater increases in self-compassion than comparisons (k = 9; g = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.56), although the quality of RCTs in this analysis was poor. Findings suggest that principles of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion may be learned through cheap, easily accessible, and low-intensity interventions delivered via smartphone apps. However, the quality of available evidence is poor, as low risk of bias was noted in few trials (18%) and the observed effects were likely explained by a digital placebo.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been increasingly recognized that some people experience post-traumatic growth (PTG) as a result of struggling with cancer. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify psychosocial interventions that might facilitate PTG in adults with cancer. METHODS: A search was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ProQuest up to 16 September 2022. The PRISMA guidelines were followed; all included interventional studies had to comprise 30 or more adults with cancer, using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, from 1994 forward. RESULTS: A total of 2731 articles were retrieved, 1028 of those were screened and 37 unique trials were included (46 articles). A large number of studies were published since 2018 (52.4%), were randomized controlled trials (43.2%), and had group interventions (34.8%), including mainly female participants (83.8%) with a single cancer type (54.1%). Most interventions (75.7%) were moderately to highly effective in increasing PTG (d = 0.65, 95% CI 0.39-0.91) with the most effective interventions using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (d = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.05-2.44), Mindfulness-based (d = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.14-0.94) and Education, Peer Support and Health Coaching interventions (d = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.1-0.46). Expression-based and Positive Psychology-based approaches also showed promising results. Notably, the majority of studies had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: PTG facilitation is a promising field that should be pursued as it not only allows people with cancer to overcome their trauma but also results in them going over and above their pre-cancer state, enhancing resilience, health, and well-being.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been widely applied in competition sports with respect to athletic performance and mental health promotion, whereas evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has not been well summarized. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the existing evidence on the effects of MBIs on improving athletic performance, mindfulness level, mindfulness-related psychological components (e.g., acceptance, self-compassion, flow), and mental health (e.g., burnout, stress, psychological well-being) among athletes. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was implemented on five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect) and relevant review papers. The article selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction were performed by two investigators independently. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to evaluate the effects of interventions using the random effect model. Among the 1897 original hits, thirty-two eligible RCT studies were included in the systematic review, of which seven were involved in the meta-analysis. The results showed that MBIs were effective in promoting athletes' athletic performances (by narrative synthesis), mindfulness-level (n = 3; SMD = 0.50, 95% CI = [0.17, 0.83]; I(2) = 45%, p = 0.16), and mindfulness-related psychological components (n = 5; SMD = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.53, 1.10], I(2) = 77%, p =0.001), while no significant intervention effects were found on the mental health of athletes (n = 4; SMD = -0.03, 95% CI = [-0.35, 0.29], I(2) = 89%, p < 0.001). Our findings preliminarily support the potential effectiveness of MBIs, whereas more high-quality RCTs were needed in the future.",

            "abstract": "Prior research has found that many genetic counselors (GCs) experience burnout. Studies of other clinicians have demonstrated that burnout can have significant detrimental consequences for clinicians, patients, and the healthcare system. We sought to explore the prevalence of, contributors to, and consequences of burnout among GCs. We performed a secondary data analysis of baseline data from Me-GC, a randomized controlled trial of meditation for GCs. We applied a systems model of burnout proposed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), which depicts burnout arising from a combination of contributors that include both work system and individual mediating factors, and then leading to consequences. Validated self-report scales were used to measure burnout and most contributors and consequences. Female and white GCs were over-represented in our sample. Over half (57.2%) of the 397 participants had Professional Fulfillment Index scores indicative of burnout. Multiple potential contributors were associated with burnout, consistent with its known multifactorial nature. Among work system factors, higher levels of burnout were associated with insufficient administrative support, lack of autonomy, and not feeling valued by non-GC colleagues. Individual mediating factors associated with greater burnout included higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Participants with lower levels of burnout reported greater mindfulness, resilience, and use of professional self-care behaviors. Among variables categorized as consequences, higher levels of burnout were associated with lower levels of empathy, counseling alliance, and positive unconditional regard, as well as higher reactive distress, and a greater desire to reduce the amount of time spent on clinical care. Given the prevalence and potential consequences of burnout observed here, it is imperative that the field take steps to mitigate burnout risk.",

            "abstract": "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of positive psychological interventions on quality of life, positive psychological outcomes and negative psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer often suffer from various psychological problems and have a poor quality of life. Positive psychological interventions have been increasingly applied to patients with cancer, but the results of these studies have not been synthesized. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials according to PRISMA. METHODS: Six English databases and four Chinese databases were searched from the inception to December 2022. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RevMan was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine randomized controlled trials examined the effects of positive psychological interventions including meaning therapy, dignity therapy, positive psychotherapy, mindfulness- based intervention, life review, expressive writing intervention, acceptance and commitment psychotherapy, attention and interpretation therapy, compassion training and spiritual therapy on patients with cancer. Positive psychological interventions significantly improved the quality of life, enhanced positive psychological outcomes including well-being, meaning of life, self-esteem, optimism, resilience and self-efficacy and alleviated negative psychological outcomes including depression, anxiety and hopelessness. However, the heterogeneity of some outcomes was rather high, due to the wide diversity of the interventions included. CONCLUSION: Positive psychological interventions have potentially positive effects on improving quality of life, enhancing positive psychological outcomes and alleviating negative psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity and the lack of follow-up studies, more high-quality studies are needed to confirm the results of our review and to clarify the long-term effects of positive psychological interventions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As feasible psychological interventions, healthcare professionals can consider applying appropriate positive psychological interventions according to the condition of cancer patients.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caring for people with dementia is highly challenging, and family carers are recognised as being at increased risk of physical and mental ill-health. Most current interventions have limited success in reducing stress among carers of people with dementia. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) draws on a range of practices and may be a promising approach to helping carers of people with dementia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of MBSR in reducing the stress of family carers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years to Issue 9 of 12, 2017), MEDLINE (Ovid SP 1950 to September 2017), Embase (Ovid SP 1974 to Sepetmber 2017), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science 1945 to September 2017), PsycINFO (Ovid SP 1806 to September 2017), CINAHL (all dates to September 2017), LILACS (all dates to September 2017), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) up to 6 September 2017, with no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MBSR for family carers of people with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened references for inclusion criteria, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information, then conducted meta-analyses, or reported results narratively in the case of insufficient data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs involving 201 carers assessing the effectiveness of MBSR. Controls used in included studies varied in structure and content. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programmes were compared with either active controls (those matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. education, social support, or progressive muscle relaxation), or inactive controls (those not matched for time and attention with MBSR, i.e. self help education or respite care). One trial used both active and inactive comparisons with MBSR. All studies were at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessment. Most studies provided no information about selective reporting, incomplete outcome data, or allocation concealment.1. Compared with active controls, MBSR may reduce depressive symptoms of carers at the end of the intervention (3 trials, 135 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.28; P<0.001; low-quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low-quality evidence).Mindfulness-based stress reduction compared with active control may decrease carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 78 participants; mean difference (MD) -7.50, 95% CI -13.11 to -1.89; P<0.001; low-quality evidence) and may slightly increase carer burden (3 trials, 135 participants; SMD 0.24, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.58; P=0.18; low-quality evidence), although both results were imprecise, and we could not exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be sure of any effect on carers' coping style, nor could we determine whether carers were more or less likely to drop out of treatment.2. Compared with inactive controls, MBSR showed no clear evidence of any effect on depressive symptoms (2 trials, 50 participants; MD -1.97, 95% CI -6.89 to 2.95; P=0.43; low-quality evidence). We could not be certain of any effect on clinically significant depressive symptoms (very low-quality evidence).In this comparison, MBSR may also reduce carer anxiety at the end of the intervention (1 trial, 33 participants; MD -7.27, 95% CI -14.92 to 0.38; P=0.06; low-quality evidence), although we were unable to exclude little or no effect. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, we could not be certain of any effects of MBSR on carer burden, the use of positive coping strategies, or dropout rates.We found no studies that looked at quality of life of carers or care-recipients, or institutionalisation.Only one included study reported on adverse events, noting a single adverse event related to yoga practices at home AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for non-specific effects of the intervention (i.e. comparing it with an active control), low-quality evidence suggests that MBSR may reduce carers' depressive symptoms and anxiety, at least in the short term.There are significant limitations to the evidence base on MBSR in this population. Our GRADE assessment of the evidence was low to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily because of high risk of detection or performance bias, and imprecision.In conclusion, MBSR has the potential to meet some important needs of the carer, but more high-quality studies in this field are needed to confirm its efficacy.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects and experiences of mindfulness stress-reduction training as described by patients with cancer participating in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction training program. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: The study is based on analysis of data collected in semistructured interviews of the participants (n = 18) after the completion of a mindfulness-meditation training program. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course. RESULTS: Most participants expressed a number of perceived positive effects of participating in the mindfulness program including increased calm, enhanced sleep quality, more energy, less physical pain, and increased well-being. However, a few participants experienced no effect. Both negative and positive views of the specific meditation and yoga exercises included in the program were expressed. Components that were described as of particular importance, regarding the experience of participating in the program, were the nonjudgmental and accepting approach guiding the program and the instructors, the influence of the group process and sharing experiences with patients with similar experiences, and the emphasis on increased awareness of the present moment. CONCLUSION: This study gives support for the use of mindfulness programs in reducing stress-related complaints among some patients with a cancer diagnosis. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The positive experiences of mindfulness training reported by patients with cancer call for further studies examining the possibilities and requirements for implementation of mindfulness programs in clinical practice.",

The objective of the present study was to characterize the reporting of \"positive\" results in randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. We also assessed mindfulness-based therapy trial registrations for indications of possible reporting bias and reviewed recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses to determine whether reporting biases were identified. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of mindfulness-based therapy. The number of positive trials was described and compared to the number that might be expected if mindfulness-based therapy were similarly effective compared to individual therapy for depression. Trial registries were searched for mindfulness-based therapy registrations. CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were also searched for mindfulness-based therapy systematic reviews and meta-analyses. RESULTS: 108 (87%) of 124 published trials reported \u22651 positive outcome in the abstract, and 109 (88%) concluded that mindfulness-based therapy was effective, 1.6 times greater than the expected number of positive trials based on effect size d = 0.55 (expected number positive trials = 65.7). Of 21 trial registrations, 13 (62%) remained unpublished 30 months post-trial completion. No trial registrations adequately specified a single primary outcome measure with time of assessment. None of 36 systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that effect estimates were overestimated due to reporting biases.

METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted as a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up inquiry with a control group. A total of 30 patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected through the convenience sampling method out of all patients referred to ALA Cancer Prevention and Control Center (MACSA) in Isfahan city, Iran. They were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group received mindfulness-based supportive psychotherapy (SP) for 6 sessions of 90-min, while the control group only received treatment as usual (TAU). Finally, both groups were re-evaluated through the post-test and follow-up stages after 3 months. The research instruments included the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Neff's Self-Compassion Scale. Collected data were analyzed using the repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The results showed that the group supportive psychotherapy significantly increased posttraumatic growth (p < 0.05) and resilience (p < 0.05), and improved self-compassion (p < 0.05) in the experimental group over the post-test phase. At the post-intervention phase, the effect sizes were Cohen's d = 0.72, d = 0.68, and d = 0.63 for post-traumatic growth, resilience, and self-compassion, respectively.

The aim of this review is to describe and evaluate the body of evidence-based research on the use of MBIs to support the psychological wellbeing of professional staff in EOL care settings. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Database records were extracted from ERIC, PsycInfo, EBSCO, PubMed Central (PMC) and Web of Science, using search terms to locate peer-reviewed studies on professional (not volunteer) staff in dedicated end-of-life settings, administering MBIs not embedded in more general therapeutic modalities (such as ACT or DBT). After removing duplicates, 8701 potential studies were identified: eliminating those that did not fit the eligibility criteria reduced the number of eligible studies to six. Results: A total of six empirical studies were identified and further evaluated. Interventions primarily focussed on reducing burnout symptoms, increasing self-care and self-compassion, and fostering mindfulness. Studies demonstrated very little overlap in treatment, methodology and measures. Only one study was a randomised control trial, which on application of the 3-item Jadad quality scoring, (evidence of randomisation, blinding of researcher to participants' identity and accounts provided of all participants), achieved 1 out of 5 possible points.

            "abstract": "Many individuals believe that meditation has the capacity to not only alleviate mental-illness but to improve prosociality. This article systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the effects of meditation interventions on prosociality in randomized controlled trials of healthy adults. Five types of social behaviours were identified: compassion, empathy, aggression, connectedness and prejudice. Although we found a moderate increase in prosociality following meditation, further analysis indicated that this effect was qualified by two factors: type of prosociality and methodological quality. Meditation interventions had an effect on compassion and empathy, but not on aggression, connectedness or prejudice. We further found that compassion levels only increased under two conditions: when the teacher in the meditation intervention was a co-author in the published study; and when the study employed a passive (waiting list) control group but not an active one. Contrary to popular beliefs that meditation will lead to prosocial changes, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the effects of meditation on prosociality were qualified by the type of prosociality and methodological quality of the study. We conclude by highlighting a number of biases and theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this area.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may have positive physiological and psychological benefits for breast cancer survivors. However, few studies involved a combination of the relevant literatures to confirm the effects. METHODS: Our study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing interventions of MBCT and control protocols for alleviation of symptoms among breast cancer survivors. We calculated pooled mean differences (MDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using random effects models to estimate summary effect sizes. RESULTS: Thirteen trials with 20-245 participants were considered in our studies; for the meta-analysis, 11 of these studies were eligible for assessment. The pooled meta-analysis results revealed that at the end of the MBCT intervention, participants' anxiety (SMD, - 0.70; 95% CI, - 1.26 to - 0.13; I(2) = 69%), pain (SMD, - 0.64; 95% CI, - 0.92 to - 0.37; I(2) = 0%), and depression (SMD, - 0.65; 95% CI, - 1.14 to - 0.17; I(2) = 75%) levels significantly decreased, and their mindfulness (MD, 8.83; 95% CI, 3.88 to 13.78; I(2) = 68%) levels significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The MBCT may be associated with improved pain, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. However, the quantitative analysis pointed to an inconclusive result due to moderate to high levels of heterogeneity among indicator of anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. Future work requires more studies to better elucidate the clinical significance of this possible association. The results suggest that MBCT is highly beneficial as an intervention for patients who have received treatment for breast cancer.",

However, patients experience barriers to participating in face-to-face MBCT. Individual Internet-based MBCT (eMBCT) could be an alternative. The study aim was to compare MBCT and eMBCT with treatment as usual (TAU) for psychological distress in patients with cancer. Patients and Methods We obtained ethical and safety approval to include 245 patients with cancer with psychological distress (\u2265 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) in the study. They were randomly allocated to MBCT (n = 77), eMBCT (n = 90), or TAU (n = 78). Patients completed baseline (T0) and postintervention (T1) assessments. The primary outcome was psychological distress on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes were psychiatric diagnosis, fear of cancer recurrence, rumination, health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive mental health. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed modeling on the intention-to-treat sample. Because both interventions were compared with TAU, the type I error rate was set at P < .025. Results Compared with TAU, patients reported significantly less psychological distress after both MBCT (Cohen's d, .45; P < .001) and eMBCT (Cohen's d, .71; P < .001) . In addition, post-treatment prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was lower with both MBCT (33% improvement; P = .030) and eMBCT (29% improvement; P = .076) in comparison with TAU (16%), but these changes were not statistically significant. Both interventions reduced fear of cancer recurrence and rumination, and increased mental health-related quality of life, mindfulness skills, and positive mental health compared with TAU (all Ps < .025). Physical health-related quality of life did not improve ( P = .343). Conclusion Compared with TAU, MBCT and eMBCT were similarly effective in reducing psychological distress in a sample of distressed heterogeneous patients with cancer.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Well-being apps represent a promising and scalable approach for improving mental health outcomes in youth, especially during a global pandemic when access to face-to-face interventions may be limited. Whitu (meaning 7 in the New Zealand Maori language Te Reo) is a newly developed well-being app with 7 modules that support young people to learn and practice evidence-based coping skills, including relaxation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and goal-setting. OBJECTIVE: During this pilot, we explored the acceptability, usability, and preliminary efficacy of Whitu before refining the app for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: We recruited 20 New Zealand young people aged 16-25 years via social media to trial the first prototype of the Whitu app over 6 weeks. Within-group differences from baseline to 2- and 6-weeks post intervention in self-reported well-being, depression, anxiety, stress, self-compassion, optimism and sleep quality were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVA. A further 21 participants aged 16-30 years were recruited to participate in 4 focus groups to give feedback on the app's usability and cultural acceptability. Feedback was analysed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in anxiety (p = 0.024) and stress (p = 0.017) were observed from baseline to 2-weeks post intervention. Improvements in well-being (p = 0.021), depression (p = 0.031), anxiety (p = 0.005), and stress (p = 0.004) were also observed from baseline to 6-weeks. No statistically significant changes were seen in self-compassion, optimism, or sleep quality. Effect sizes (partial \u03b7(2)s) ranged from 0.25 (depression) to 0.42 (stress). Qualitative feedback comprised of five key themes, namely: factors affecting engagement, issues with functionality, preferences regarding aesthetics, effectiveness and adverse effects, and cultural acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that Whitu may be an effective app for improving multiple dimensions of young people's well-being. Modifications to the look and feel, cultural content, and onboarding have been undertaken based on the qualitative feedback, and an RCT is currently underway.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Yoga has several mechanisms that make it a promising treatment for depression and anxiety, including physical activity, behavioural activation, and mindfulness. Following positive outcomes from adapted CBT interventions incorporating mindfulness-based practices, this study explored the effects of a therapeutic yoga program as an adjunct to group-based CBT for depression or anxiety. METHODS: This was a pragmatic preference trial involving adults diagnosed with depression or anxiety in a regional primary mental healthcare service (n = 59), comparing transdiagnostic group CBT (n = 27) with transdiagnostic group CBT combined with an adjunct therapeutic yoga program (n = 32). A preference recruitment design allowed eligible participants (n = 35) to self-select into the adjunct program. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS) was assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and three-months follow up. RESULTS: CBT + Yoga was an acceptable alternative to CBT alone. Significant reductions were observed in total DASS scores and the 3 subscales of the DASS for both groups, however CBT + Yoga showed significantly lower depressive and anxiety symptoms post-intervention, compared to CBT alone. CBT + Yoga also showed sustained reductions in depressive symptoms over three-months, and more rapid reductions in depressive symptoms, compared to CBT alone. LIMITATIONS: These findings should be considered preliminary due to the moderate sample size, with a rigorous randomised control trial necessary to definitively support the integration of yoga within mental health care to augment the benefits and uptake of transdiagnostic CBT for depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Complementing other mindfulness-based practices, therapeutic yoga shows promise as an adjunct to transdiagnostic CBT.",

Thirty-nine elderly were randomized to MBSR (n = 20) or a waitlist control group (n = 19), mean age was 82 years. Both groups completed pre-post measures of health-related quality of life, acceptance and psychological flexibility, facets of mindfulness, self-compassion, and psychological distress. A subset of MBSR participants completed qualitative interviews. MBSR participants showed significantly greater improvement in acceptance and psychological flexibility and in role limitations due to physical health. In the qualitative interviews, MBSR participants reported increased awareness, less judgment, and greater self-compassion.

            "abstract": "Many women experience anxiety during pregnancy with potential negative effects on maternal, birth, and child outcomes. Because of potential risks of fetal exposure to psychotropic medications, efficacious non-pharmacologic approaches are urgently needed. However, no published studies of psychotherapeutic treatments for anxiety in pregnancy exist. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) may substantially reduce anxiety and co-morbid symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. Coping with Anxiety through Living Mindfully (CALM) Pregnancy is an adaptation of MBCT designed to address anxiety in pregnant women. This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of the CALM Pregnancy intervention in pregnant women anxiety. Twenty-four pregnant women with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or prominent symptoms of generalized anxiety participated in an open treatment trial of the CALM Pregnancy group intervention. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by structured clinical interview, and self-report measures of anxiety, worry, depression, self-compassion, and mindfulness were completed at baseline and post-intervention. Qualitative feedback was elicited via questionnaire. Twenty-three participants completed the intervention with high attendance and good compliance with home practice. Completers showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in anxiety, worry, and depression, and significant increases in self-compassion and mindfulness. Of the 17 participants who met GAD criteria at baseline, only one continued to meet criteria post-intervention. Participants regarded their experience in the intervention to be overwhelmingly positive. MBCT in the form of the CALM Pregnancy intervention holds potential to provide effective, non-pharmacological treatment for pregnant women with anxiety. These promising findings warrant further testing of the intervention with a randomized controlled trial.",

            "abstract": "Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life (QOL) and well-being. As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation, calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes in health outcomes in cancer survivors. In this exploratory study, which comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind-body interventions, mind-body bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance. Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once per week for 3 weeks. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention (~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up. In this cancer survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable across the 3 time points, of about 3 months' duration, and mean baseline sOT levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age. Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however, several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being. Regarding intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE. In this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE, and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group compared with those in SHE. The findings in this exploratory study suggest that sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into the effects of mind-body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.",

DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled trial. LOCATION: The study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Bologna, Italy. SUBJECTS: Patients who had MD and who did not achieve remission following at least 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment were considered for inclusion. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive MBCT or psycho-education and were prospectively followed for 8 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: MD severity was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life, as measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale, and the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI), respectively, were also included. All assessments were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Changes of psychologic variables over the study period were analyzed by means of the repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Of 29 screened subjects, 16 received MBCT or psycho-education. Both HAMD and PGWBI scores improved to a significantly higher extent in the MBCT group than in the psycho-educational control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by a small sample size and the lack of follow-up measures, the results of this preliminary study suggest the superiority of MBCT over psycho-education for subjects who had MD and who did not achieve remission following antidepressant treatment.",

            "abstract": "An increasing amount of scientific work suggests positive effects of exercise-related interventions in patients with burnout. Exercise therapy could therefore be a useful intervention procedure in the treatment of burnout. The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine empirical findings for exercise therapy used to treat burnout in the occupational setting, including the variety of the application and variety of the exercise modality itself. Electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubPsych, PsycInfo) were searched (January 2018) for randomized controlled trials reporting on exercise therapy intervention studies in persons with burnout. The burnout scores from the various measurement instruments as well as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and seen as the main outcomes and measures. Four out of six studies with a total sample of 248 participants could be used for meta-analysis. A statement on the combined effect size can only be made with caution due to the length of the confidence interval of [-0.41; 0.09]. With an I2 value of 0%, no heterogeneity is present in this meta-analysis. Ultimately there was no clear difference found between intervention and control conditions. This paper does not support the widespread assumption that exercise therapy seems to be a successful means to alleviate burnout symptoms. However, the different types of physical activity and treatment modalities used in the included studies impede clear conclusions. Future studies should deal with the specific efficacy of different exercise modalities and their combination with further cognitive behavioural or mindfulness-based interventions.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress-reduction program on the resting levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, and submaximal exercise responses in women with heart disease. SUBJECTS: Random selection with the numbers 1 and 2 were used to assign 18 women (60 +/-6.3 years old) with documented histories of heart disease to a treatment group (n = 9) or a control group (n = 9). Speilberger's state anxiety scores for the treatment (M = 37.88; standard deviation (SD) = 10.91) and control group (M = 43.22; SD = 12.26) were not significantly different prior to the start of the study. However, their scores fell in the upper percentile rank for normal adults in their age category. INTERVENTION: The intervention was provided one night each week for 2 hours over a period of 8 weeks. The intervention included didactic, inductive, and experiential modes of learning regarding stress responses and mindfulness skill-development training. DESIGN: Pre-post test hormonal measurements and physical function were analyzed using a 2 (group) by 2 (time) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures following the 8-week program. Submaximal exercise responses were also compared between the treatment group and the control group following the 8-week program. A 2 (group) by 3 (time) ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze the data. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Weekly meetings were held on a university medical school campus. Submaximal exercise responses were recorded while participants cycled on a stationary bike in an applied physiology laboratory following the 8-week program. RESULTS: There were no significant main effects or interaction for the resting levels of stress hormones or physical functioning. There were no significant interactions for the submaximal exercise responses, however, there were significant main effects between groups for ventilation [F(2,32) = 7.65, p < .01, f = 0.8], and between group [F(1,16) = 8.84, p < .01, f = 0.8] and time [F(2,32) = 10.42, p < .01, f = 0.9], for breathing frequency. CONCLUSION: While the 8-week stress reduction program for women with heart disease did not show significant interactions between groups for resting levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, or submaximal exercise responses, there was a significant difference in breathing patterns between the 2 groups during exercise following the mindfulness-based stress-reduction program. There was also a trend for change in the intervention group in the resting levels of cortisol and physical function scores that was not seen in the control group. Future studies could use the effect size generated from this pilot study to calculate the number of subjects needed for adequate power to detect significant differences between groups.",

In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), MBSR has demonstrated efficacy in various conditions including reducing chronic pain-related distress and improving quality of life in healthy individuals. There have, however, been no qualitative studies investigating participants' descriptions of changes experienced over multiple time points during the course of the programme. This qualitative study of an MBSR cohort (N = 8 healthy individuals) in a larger RCT examined participants' daily diary descriptions of their home-practice experiences. The study used a two-part method, combining grounded theory with a close-ended coding approach. The grounded theory analysis revealed that during the trial, all participants, to varying degrees, described moments of distress related to practice; at the end of the course, all participants who completed the training demonstrated greater detail and clarity in their descriptions, improved affect, and the emergence of an observing self. The closed-ended coding schema, carried out to shed light on the development of an observing self, revealed that the emergence of an observing self was not related to the valence of participants' experiential descriptions: even participants whose diaries contained predominantly negative characterizations of their experience throughout the trial were able, by the end of the trial, to demonstrate an observing, witnessing attitude towards their own distress. Progress in MBSR may rely less on the valence of participants' experiences and more on the way participants describe and relate to their own inner experience.",

            "abstract": "Background Mindfulness-based programs hold promise for improving cardiovascular health (e.g. physical activity, diet, blood pressure). However, despite theoretical frameworks proposed, no studies have reported qualitative findings on how study participants themselves believe mindfulness-based programs improved their cardiovascular health. With an emphasis on in-depth, open-ended investigation, qualitative methods are well suited to explore the mechanisms underlying health outcomes. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the mechanisms through which the mindfulness-based program, Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP), may influence cardiovascular health. Methods This qualitative study was conducted as part of a Stage 1 single arm trial with one-year follow-up. The MB-BP curriculum was adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to direct participants' mindfulness skills towards modifiable determinants of blood pressure. Four focus group discussions were conducted (N = 19 participants), and seven additional participants were selected for in-depth interviews. Data analysis was conducted using the standard approach of thematic analysis. Following double-coding of audio-recorded transcripts, four members of the study team engaged in an iterative process of data analysis and interpretation. Results Participants identified self-awareness, attention control, and emotion regulation as key mechanisms that led to improvements in cardiovascular health. Within these broader themes, many participants detailed a process beginning with increased self-awareness to sustain attention and regulate emotions. Many also explained that the specific relationship between self-awareness and emotion regulation enabled them to respond more skillfully to stressors. In a secondary sub-theme, participants suggested that higher self-awareness helped them engage in positive health behaviors (e.g. healthier dietary choices). Conclusion Qualitative analyses suggest that MB-BP mindfulness practices allowed participants to engage more effectively in self-regulation skills and behaviors lowering cardiovascular disease risk, which supports recent theory. Results are consistent with quantitative mechanistic findings showing emotion regulation, perceived stress, interoceptive awareness, and attention control are influenced by MB-BP.",

Stress-reduction interventions are urgently needed for the comprehensive care of people living with HIV. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one approach that has shown promise as an intervention for patients facing other medical conditions for reducing disease progression, psychological distress and maladaptive behaviours. In this systematic review, we identified 11 studies that have examined MBSR as an intervention for HIV-positive populations. Of the studies, six were randomised designs, one was a quasi-experimental design, and the remaining four were pre- and post-test designs. The preliminary outcomes support MBSR to decrease emotional distress with mixed evidence for impact on disease progression. Effect sizes were generally small to moderate in magnitude.

Recently, several lines of research have explored the potential for mindfulness-therapy in treating somatization disorders, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome.Methods: Thirteen studies were identified as fulfilling the present criteria of employing randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy of any form of MBT in treating somatization disorders. A meta-analysis of the effects of mindfulness-based therapy on pain, symptom severity, quality of life, depression, and anxiety was performed to determine the potential of this form of treatment.Findings: While limited in power, the meta-analysis indicated a small to moderate positive effect of MBT (compared to wait-list or support group controls) in reducing pain (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.37, -0.03; p<0.05), symptom severity (SMD = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.54, -0.26; p<0.001), depression (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.40, -0.07, p<0.01), and anxiety (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.42, 0.02, p = 0.07) associated with somatization disorders, and improving quality of life (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.59; p<0.001) in patients with this disorder. Subgroup analyses indicated that the efficacy of MBT was most consistent for irritable bowel syndrome (p<0.001 for pain, symptom severity, and quality of life), and that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MCBT) were more effective than eclectic/unspecified MBT.Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that MBT may be effective in treating at least some aspects of somatization disorders.

Methods A quasi-experimental study was carried out with 110 Lithuanian female students (mean age 21.5 +/- 3.5, range 19-35 years). Thirty students voluntarily participated in the intervention programme and 80 students volunteered in the assessment-only control group. The intervention comprised five cognitive behavioural therapy classroom education sessions and mindfulness-based exercise (one exercise workout per week). The intervention group was evaluated with a pre-test and post-test and the control group completed measures at parallel times. Results Compared with the control group participants, the intervention group participants reported greater improvements in positive body image and a reduction in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness and internalisation of stereotyped beauty ideals, with medium to large effects. There were significant time x group interactions for pre-test to post-test changes in internalisation of beauty ideals, body area satisfaction, body dissatisfaction and body appreciation. In all cases, the interaction reflected greater pre-test to post-test changes in the intervention group compared with the control group, whose scores remained stable. A decrease in appearance orientation, overweight preoccupation, disordered eating and physical activity was observed in the control group, but the effect sizes were low.

There was a wide range in methodological quality and most studies were underpowered or did not present power calculations. However, MBCT did not appear to precipitate mania, and there is preliminary evidence to support a positive effect on anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and broad attentional and frontal-executive control.Limitations: As meta-analysis is not yet possible due to study heterogeneity and quality, the current review is a narrative synthesis, and therefore net effects cannot be estimated.Conclusions: MBCT for BD holds promise, but more high-quality studies are needed in order to ascertain its clinical efficacy.

A total of 10 men (M-age = 40.3, SD = 14.01, Range = 20-67) with a diagnosis of situational ED were recruited to participate in a 4-week mindfulness-based treatment group. The group was adapted from protocols shown to be effective for women with sexual dysfunction and edited to include content specific to situational ED. Sessions were 2.25 hours in length, included daily home-practice activities, and integrated elements of psychoeducation, sex therapy, and mindfulness skills. Men completed questionnaires (International Index of Erectile Functioning, Relationship Assessment Scale, Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire, a treatment expectation questionnaire) at 3 time points (prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and 6 months after treatment). 5 men (Mage = 44.4, SD = 15.76, Range = 30-67) participated in qualitative exit interviews.Main Outcome Measure: Findings support the feasibility of adapting a mindfulness-based group treatment for situational ED.Results: With respect to feasibility, the dropout rate was 10%, with 1 participant who did not complete the treatment. Comparisons between Time 1 and Time 3 self-reports suggested that this treatment protocol holds promise as a novel means of impacting erectile functioning (Cohen's d = 0.63), overall sexual satisfaction (Cohen's d = 1.02), and non-judgmental observation of one's experience (Cohen's d = 0.52). Participants' expectations for the treatment were generally positive and correlated to self-reported outcomes (r =.68.73). Qualitative analyses revealed 6 themes: normalization, group magic, identification of effective treatment targets, increased self-efficacy, relationship factors, and treatment barriers.Clinical Implications: In a shift toward a biopsychosocial framework for the treatment of men's sexual dysfunction, clinicians may consider incorporating mindfulness to address psychosocial and psychosexual components of dysfunction.Strength & Limitations: This is the first study to our knowledge to adapt mindfulness protocols for use with men's sexual dysfunction. Because this is a pilot study aimed at feasibility, the sample size is small and no control group was included, thus conclusions about efficacy and generalizability cannot be made.Conclusion: The current study suggests that a mindfulness group therapy framework offers a feasible and potentially promising treatment avenue for men with situational ED.

            "abstract": "ObjectiveWe aim to uncover the hot topics and development trends in clinical psychology research in the United States.MethodUtilizing bibliometric analysis, we examined clinical psychology papers published in the United States from 2010 to 2022 in the Web of Science database, employing citation analysis, content analysis, author analysis, and journal analysis.ResultsOur analysis revealed a significant increase in clinical psychology research, notably catalyzed by the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. This surge was particularly evident in studies addressing mental disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors, as well as psychological trauma related to issues like family conflict, elder abuse, and collective trauma. Furthermore, there was a distinct shift towards studying diverse populations, including gender and racial minorities, mothers, and adolescents. Therapeutic approaches, such as mindfulness-based practices and AI-assisted technologies, also gained prominence.ConclusionsThis study represents the first large-scale bibliometric analysis in the field of clinical psychology in the United States. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of studying psychological issues linked to major events. Also, researchers are increasingly focusing on minority groups. This trend, along with the use of new technologies like big data and artificial intelligence, guides future research in clinical psychology.Public Health Significance StatementThe works in this review suggest that the changing landscape of clinical psychology, especially post-COVID-19. The increased research post-pandemic emphasizes addressing psychological trauma arising from societal issues like family conflicts, elder abuse, and collective trauma. A positive shift towards inclusivity is evident in research, focusing on diverse groups like gender minorities, racial minorities, mothers, and adolescents. Additionally, the amplified focus on mental disorders like PTSD, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors during the pandemic stresses the need for tailored interventions and support systems. Exploring innovative methods such as mindfulness-based practices and AI-assisted technologies showcases the field's adaptability in mental health interventions.",

Methods Ninety-seven direct support professionals were surveyed to determine level of mindfulness, coping styles, resilience and burnout and were interviewed 3 months later to determine if they were still working with the aggressive adult. Results Mindfulness skills of describing non-judgmentally and observing one's environment, as well as problem-focused coping, emerged as protective factors against burnout, while avoidance-focused and maladaptive coping emerged as risk factors. Mindful openness acted as the only predictor of job retention. Conclusions These results support that paid caregivers should receive trainings in mindfulness and positive coping mechanisms as part of their job trainings, to promote positive outcomes for both themselves and the people they support.",

One hundred and four parents of children with ASD were equally assigned to the intervention and control groups. The study groups were matched on measures of their gender and age, and level of severity of ASD in children. The intervention group participated in MBI program for 5 weeks, while the control group had not attended the program.Results: After the intervention program, results of paired samples t-test indicated that parents in the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in measures of psychological health domain of QOL, social health domain of QOL, mindfulness, and positive stress reappraisal with medium to large effect size (P < 0.01). The control group demonstrated improvement in measures of the dependent variables with small effect size.Conclusion: MBI is culturally adaptable, acceptable, and effective method to improve QOL and PSR in parents of children with ASD.

To test this hypothesis, we examined prospective relations between state mindfulness and positive reappraisal in a community sample participating in a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI). At seven weekly time points throughout the MBI, participants (N = 234) engaged in a 10-min mindfulness meditation exercise at home and completed a measure of the degree of state mindfulness experienced during the meditation, as well as a measure of their use of positive reappraisal over the previous week. Support for the mindful reappraisal hypothesis of the Mindfulness-to-Meaning Theory was found: in latent growth curve and multivariate autoregressive latent trajectory models, increases in the trajectory of state mindfulness experienced during meditation were significantly and robustly associated with more frequent use of positive reappraisal over the course of participation in the 8 week-long MBI. Thus, mindfulness and reappraisal may reciprocally enhance one another as interdependent components of a positive feedback loop whose structure might be best described as an upward spiral.",

The 90-minute Mind-STRIDE training, adapted from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), was provided as the final component of a half-day diabetes self-management education class at a Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient diabetes clinic. Following initial training, participants were asked to practice mindfulness at home for 10 minutes each day during the 3-month study. Study recruitment and retention were calculated as rates. Veteran and diabetes educator satisfaction were assessed by rating scales and open-ended comments. Psychosocial-behavioral and metabolic outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months after initial training. Bivariate correlations were performed to describe relationships between mindfulness and other outcome variables. Gain scores and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank tests were used to assess pre to post changes; Cohen's d was applied to estimate the magnitude of effects.Results Twenty-eight of 49 eligible veterans (57%) enrolled in the study. Of those, 11 veterans (39%) demonstrated participation in home practice, and 20 veterans (71%) completed the study. Overall, participants and diabetes educators were highly satisfied with the Mind-STRIDE intervention.

However, novel ways of improving outcomes for children with FASD need further investigation so that programs target not only the individual child but also the family context, which includes the parent child relationship.Aims: The current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an adapted version of the Parents under Pressure (PuP) program that addresses self-regulatory processes, through improving the parent child relationship and the use of mindfulness-based strategies for both children and parents.Methods: This was a mixed methods study. Feasibility was examined by evaluating recruitment, data collection/outcome measures, and intervention procedures. The study used a phenomenological approach to obtain qualitative information from caregivers and a single-case experimental design to evaluate the preliminary participant responses to the intervention.Results: Two out of three families completed treatment. The recruitment and intervention procedures were found to be suitable for and acceptable to the families involved. Some concerns were identified regarding the outcome measures that would need to be addressed in future research. Quantitative and qualitative outcomes were positive.Conclusions and implications: The results provide preliminary support for the feasibility of an adapted version of the PuP program.

From a western perspective, mindfulness-based stress relief (MBSR) is widely researched. Therefore, 15 studies from peer-reviewed research from 2015 and 2020 were used to examine various forms of meditation and describe a broader range of meditation practices other than MBSR. The different forms of meditation are: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Portugal), Active Engagement (Portugal), Adapted Mindfulness Program (Brazil), Adapted Mindfulness Program (Brazil), Cognitively-based Compassionate Training, Loving-kindness (United States, US), Mantra Meditation (US), Mindfulness-based stress reduction (US), Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (South Korea), Osho (India), Psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (Italy), Transcendental Meditation (Italy), Spiritual/Secular (US), Sufi (Pakistan), and Vipassana (Australia). The review was completed using a literature search method, and all meditation approaches report positive therapeutic outcomes for all participants (n = 768).

MethodA qualitative study was performed by semi-structured in-depth interviews with 16 clinical clerkship students selected by purposive sampling. Students had participated in a MBSR training 2 years before and were asked about their current mindfulness practice, and the long-term effects of the MBSR training. Thematic analysis was conducted using the constant comparison method. Data saturation was reached after 16 interviews. ResultsMost interviewees were still engaged in regular, predominantly informal, mindfulness practice, although some discontinued mindfulness practice and reported an \"unchanged lifestyle.\" Three main themes came forward; (1) \"focused attention and open awareness\" during daily activities as core elements of long-term mindfulness practice; (2) \"changes in behavior and coping\" that resulted from taking a pause, reflecting, recognizing automatic behavioral patterns and making space for a conscious response; (3) \"integration in personal and professional life\" by enhanced enjoyment of daily activities, improved work-life-balance and making different career choices. Barriers and facilitators in starting and maintaining mindfulness practice were (1) understanding and intention as \"pre-conditions\"; (2) practical, personal, and professional factors of students in maintaining practice. ConclusionTwo years after participation in a MBSR training, many interviewees were still engaged in (mostly informal) mindfulness practice contributing to both personal and professional changes. In light of the high clerkship demands, MBSR training could be a valuable addition to medical curricula, supporting medical students in developing necessary competencies to become well-balanced professionals.",

            "abstract": "Compassion- and mindfulness-based interventions (CMBIs) and therapies hold promise to support parent resilience by enabling adaptive stress appraisal and coping, mindful parenting, and perhaps crucially, self-compassion. These contemplative modalities have recently been expanded to parents of children with chronic illness, building on successful applications for adults facing stress, chronic pain, or mental illness, and for healthcare professionals in response to caregiver burnout resulting from their work. The design and adaptation of interventions and therapies require a conceptual model of parent resilience in the context of childhood chronic illness that integrates mindfulness and compassion. The objective of this paper is to propose and describe such a model. First, we review the need for parent support interventions for this population. Second, we introduce a Model of Compassion, Mindfulness, and Resilience in Parental Caregiving. We highlight the mindful parenting approaches, guiding theories for adaptive coping, and family resilience frameworks that informed our model. Third, we describe a case of a parent to illustrate a practical application model. Finally, we outline future directions for intervention development and research to examine the impact of CMBIs on parent resilience.",

However, there is increasing evidence that mindfulness training delivers heroically relevant qualities such as increased attentional functioning, enhanced primary sensory awareness, greater conflict monitoring, increased cognitive control, reduced fear response, and an increase in loving kindness and self-sacrificing behaviors. Predicated on the notion of a no self, traditional mindfulness and its focus on enlightenment and selfless service may in fact be ideally suited to the development of the elusive trait (predictable) versus state (intermittent) heroic character. Interweaving observations and questions drawn from the science of heroism, the article explores the relevant theory, practices, and scientific outcomes of mindfulness. It finds that there is evidence that heroically relevant qualities are trainable with the suite of mindfulness techniques and that an enduring experience of selflessness and service of others (the enlightened hero) may well be within the grasp of the serious practitioner.",

            "abstract": "In the wake of COVID-19, the prevalence of stress and anxiety have become exceedingly widespread, and the cumulative effects of enduring multiple ongoing stressors altering every aspect of life have left many struggling to find suitable coping mechanisms. Students, in particular, appear to be operating in perpetual states of stress and anxiety within their constantly shifting school environments. Altering routines or restricting typical activities for students with disabilities can further induce mental stress and escalate challenging behaviors that often lead to poor academic performance. Mindfulness-based practices (MBPs) are one approach that educators can use to teach students with and without disabilities how to manage everyday stressors within the academic environment in more effective ways. Understanding how MBP's can support student outcomes and best practices for meaningful participation by students with disabilities, educators can provide their students with useful strategies for managing stress and anxiety during school or in daily life. Educators can present traditional approaches, with adaptations as necessary, to facilitate simple classroom-based mindfulness activities for students with disabilities that enhance their ability to effectively navigate everyday stressors. Through relaxation training and self-management techniques, students gain tools to strengthen their emotional and psychological well-being in ways that can also enhance academic outcomes. While the practices are universal and beneficial for all students, they can be exceptionally valuable for students with disabilities. Future research should continue studying the effects of school-based mindfulness practices and strategies for implementation, especially for programs serving students with disabilities.",

SIT prioritizes working with clients to resolve the impact of sexual shame, fear, and past traumas that interfere with pleasurable sexual expression. While some clients may find pathology or addiction-based models helpful for their sexual concerns, SIT supports those who do not find solely cognitive-behavioral pathology, nor addiction treatment models effective. Through an examination of the evolution of psychology's problematic, subjective codifications of normal versus abnormal, paraphilic, or deviant sexuality, the authors demonstrate the potential risks of diagnostic pathologization. SIT moves beyond such problematic pathology-based diagnostic models and redefines normal sexuality as uniquely personal. The authors then detail how SIT builds upon recent sexual health models to shift the therapeutic paradigm and better address individualized desires, compulsive behaviors, or inhibitions, not supported by standardized therapeutic models.Sexual Integration Therapy (SIT) is a sexual health model prioritizing authentic sexuality by addressing sex-negative beliefs, compulsions, shame, fear, or past traumas hindering pleasurable expression.

Results: Standard integrated care models for mental health disorders are effective at improving mood, anxiety, and function in patients with heart disease. Novel, \"blended\" collaborative care models may have even greater promise in improving cardiac outcomes, and interfacing with cardiac patients via mobile applications, text messages, and video visits may provide additional benefit. A variety of newer interventions using stress management, mindfulness, or positive psychology have shown promising effects on mental health, health behaviors, and overall cardiac outcomes. Conclusions: Further study of novel applications of collaborative care and related interventions is warranted given the potential of these programs to increase the reach and effect of mental health interventions in patients with heart disease.",

            "abstract": "Objective To assess the feasibility of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for adolescents with widespread chronic pain and other functional somatic symptoms and to make preliminary assessments of its clinical utility.Study design Three cohorts of subjects completed an 8-week MBSR program. Child-and parent-completed measures were collected at baseline and 8 and 12 weeks later. Measures included the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI), the Fibromyalgia/Symptom Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQR/SIQR), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (MASC2), and the Perceived Stress Scale. Subjects and parents were interviewed following the program to assess feasibility.Results Fifteen of 18 subjects (83%) completed the 8-week program. No adverse events occurred. Compared with baseline scores, significant changes were found in mean scores on the FDI (33% improvement, P = .026), FIQR/SIQR (26% improvement, P = .03), and MASC2 (child: 12% improvement, P = .02; parent report: 17% improvement, P = .03) at 8 weeks. MASC2 scores (child and parent) and Perceived Stress Scale scores were significantly improved at 12 weeks. More time spent doing home practice was associated with better outcomes in the FDI and FIQR/SIQR (44% and 26% improvement, respectively). Qualitative interviews indicated that subjects and parents reported social support as a benefit of the MBSR class, as well as a positive impact of MBSR on activities of daily living, and on pain and anxiety.Conclusions MBSR is a feasible and acceptable intervention in adolescents with functional somatic syndromes and has preliminary evidence for improving functional disability, symptom impact, and anxiety, with consistency between parent and child measures.",

            "abstract": "Background: Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR) proposes a systematic program for reduction of suffering associated with a wide range of medical conditions. Studies suggest improvements in general aspects of well-being, including quality of life ( QoL), coping and positive affect, as well as decreased anxiety and depression. Methods: A quasi-experimental study examined effects of an 8-week MBSR intervention among 58 female patients with fibromyalgia ( mean, 52 +/- 8 years) who underwent MBSR or an active social support procedure. Participants were assigned to groups by date of entry, and 6 subjects dropped out during the study. Self-report measures were validated German inventories and included the following scales: visual analog pain, pain perception, coping with pain, a symptom checklist and QoL. Pre- and postintervention measurements were made. Additionally, a 3-year follow-up was carried out on a subgroup of 26 participants. Results: Pre- to postintervention analyses indicated MBSR to provide significantly greater benefits than the control intervention on most dimensions, including visual analog pain, QoL subscales, coping with pain, anxiety, depression and somatic complaints ( Cohen d effect size, 0.40-1.10). Three-year follow-up analyses of MBSR participants indicated sustained benefits for these same measures ( effect size, 0.50-0.65). Conclusions: Based upon a quasi-randomized trial and long-term observational follow-up, results indicate mindfulness intervention to be of potential long-term benefit for female fibromyalgia patients.

            "abstract": "Background: Psychosocial intervention has been suggested as a potentially effective supplement to medical treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no reviews so far have quantified the existing research in terms of both psychological and physical health outcomes. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials evaluating the effects of psychosocial interventions on psychological and physical health outcomes in COPD. Methods: Two independent raters screened 1,491 references for eligibility. Twenty independent studies investigating a total of 1,361 patients were included, assessed for their methodological quality, and subjected to meta-analytic evaluation. Results: After adjusting for potential publication bias, a statistically significant overall effect was found for psychological (Hedges' g = 0.38, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.19-0.58; p < 0.001) outcomes. When analyzing individual intervention types, cognitive behavioral therapy appeared to be effective (g = 0.39, CI = 0.15-0.62; p = 0.001) for improving psychological outcomes. In contrast, for physical outcomes, only mind-body interventions (e.g. mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, and relaxation) revealed a statistically significant effect (g = 0.40; CI = 0.01-0.79; p = 0.042). Conclusions: Taken together, the results lend support to psychosocial intervention as a tool in the management of COPD. However, due to indications of possible publication bias towards positive findings, the results should be interpreted with some caution, and more high quality research is needed. (C) 2014 S.

Universities are reporting that record numbers of undergraduate students are seeking mental health services related to stress. This study assessed the feasibility of layering brief mindfulness-based practice within a large-scale university course. Data were collected from 115 participants enrolled in a third-year psychology course. The intervention took approximately 5 min of the 80-min class time on alternating course days, resulting in no deleterious effects on learning outcomes. 53.6% of the students indicated that they had used the practice outside of class, possibly leading to long-term positive effects in multiple areas. One-fifth of students reported seeking out other opportunities to learn about mindfulness in the same semester. Participants reported increased stress and decreased mindfulness over the course of the study, which corresponded to the assessment points within the semester, but may also highlight the impact of mindfulness training on awareness of both positive and negative emotional states. Future research should consider the role of brief mindfulness interventions in stress reduction, anxiety reduction, overall coping, and academic engagement in the undergraduate large-class environment.",

            "abstract": "Objectives People bereaved by suicide represent a vulnerable population, but postvention still lacks evidence-based resources to support them. Mindfulness and self-compassion-based interventions have proven effective in countering depression, PTSD symptoms, and traumatic bereavement, and may also be beneficial in suicide postvention. To assess the effectiveness of Panta Rhei, a short, intensive, mindful self-compassion-based intervention for people bereaved by suicide, we evaluated baseline and follow-up levels of psychological distress, mindfulness, and self-compassion in participants and a control group.Methods The intervention was a non-randomized trial conducted with 147 people bereaved by suicide of whom 97 participated in a short 16-h intensive experiential intervention. Each of them completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and Profiles of Mood States (POMS) 4-6 days prior to and after the intervention.Results Psychological distress significantly decreased in all areas evaluated by POMS. Participants also showed a significant increase in the FFMQ subscales Observe, Describe, Non-judge, and Non-react, in the SCS Self-Kindness subscale, and in overall Self-Compassion as inferred from significant group*time interaction effects. Sociodemographic, grief-related variables, SCS, and FFMQ at baseline did not correlate with changes in participants' psychological distress.Conclusions Despite being limited by the lack of randomization for ethical reasons and the high prevalence of highly educated females in the control and intervention groups, this study illustrates the effectiveness of a short, intensive, mindful self-compassion-based intervention for a self-selected group of people bereaved by suicide.",

They describe a model in which mindfulness training leads to a fundamental change in relationship to experience (reperceiving), which leads to changes in self-regulation, values clarification, cognitive and behavioral flexibility, and exposure. These four variables, in turn, result in salutogenic outcomes. Analyses of responses from participants in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction program did not support the mediating effect of changes in reperceiving on the relationship of mindfulness with those four variables. However, when mindfulness and reperceiving scores were combined, partial support was found for the mediating effect of the four variables on measures of psychological distress. Issues arising in attempts to test the proposed theory are discussed, including the description of the model variables and the challenges to their assessment. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Yet, scant empirical evidence exists on the value of purpose as a mechanism relevant to psychopathology or well-being. The present research explored daily (within-person) fluctuations in purposeful pursuits and well-being in a community sample of 84 adults with (n = 41) and without (n = 43) the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder (SAD). After completing an idiographic measure of purpose in life, participants monitored their effort and progress toward this purpose, along with their well-being each day. Across 2 weeks of daily reports, we found that healthy controls reported increased self-esteem, meaning in life, positive emotions, and decreased negative emotions. People with SAD experienced substantial boosts in well-being indicators on days characterized by significant effort or progress toward their life purpose. We found no evidence for the reverse direction (with well-being boosting the amount of effort or progress that people with SAD devote to their purpose), and effects could not be attributed to comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. Results provide evidence for how commitment to a purpose in life enriches the daily existence of people with SAD. The current study supports principles that underlie what many clinicians are already doing with clients for SAD.",

As an exploratory measure, we investigated potential moderators of suicide ideation outcomes, such as self-compassion.MethodTwo cohorts of transgender and gender-diverse adolescents recruited from the US and Canada (n = 35; age range 13-17, M = 14.9, SD = 1.19) participated in an eight-session online self-compassion program. Quantitative measures of wellbeing (i.e., suicide ideation, depression, resilience) were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up, and qualitative data (through open-ended questions on an electronic form) were collected at post-intervention and 2-month follow-up.ResultsSuicide ideation decreased with large effect sizes from baseline to follow-up, and most other measures of wellbeing improved with small to moderate effect sizes. Feasibility was confirmed, and acceptability differed markedly between cohorts, with the cohort with greater acceptability improving in mental health attributes to a greater degree. Self-compassion and thwarted belongingness, a factor related to suicide ideation, moderated suicide ideation such that those with greater self-compassion or less thwarted belongingness experienced less suicide ideation.ConclusionsSelf-compassion programs can be beneficial to help transgender adolescents manage the stressors and negative emotional outcomes arising from the anti-trans sociopolitical discourse that has been pervasive in the US. We provide recommendations for future implementations, including that someone who is transgender be part of the instructional staff.

Reliable and valid psychometric tools are essential components of psychological science, and efforts have been made to produce tools for the accurate measurement of mindfulness as a construct. However, trait measurement methods, which are commonly used, may not adequately assess mindfulness and mental health outcomes in a way that allows for mechanisms to be adequately tested. Intensive longitudinal assessment methods sample behavior and experience multiple times over a brief period of several days or weeks and may be more appropriate methods for testing mechanisms of action. We provide a systematic review of published, peer-reviewed studies that used intensive longitudinal methods to investigate the effects of mindfulness on mental health outcomes. Methods Articles were included in the systematic review if mindfulness measures and/or mindfulness interventions were a part of the study design and if intensive longitudinal methods were used to assess mindfulness or mental health outcomes. Results Findings consistently demonstrated a positive association between mindfulness and mental health. Only two studies collected both trait and state measurements of either mindfulness or mental health outcomes, and results indicated that EMA produced larger effect sizes between mindfulness and mental health outcomes. Conclusions Theorized associations between mindfulness and mental health are supported by the current EMA literature. Intensive longitudinal methods may produce more consistent and reliable results through increased sensitivity and ecological validity in that they examine the momentary relationships between mindfulness and mental health outcomes. Thus, intensive longitudinal assessment may be a more appropriate method for investigating hypothesized mechanisms of action in MBPs.",

            "abstract": "University students are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues, with anxiety and depression identified as the most common conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-isolation, and difficulties linked to online teaching and learning have increased their burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Thus, the urgent need to intervene in favour of these vulnerable subjects, together with the difficulties in delivering in-person interventions because of lockdowns and restrictions, has led to prioritize digital mental health strategies. This study aimed at systematically reviewing the existing literature on digital mental health interventions targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 emergency. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases identified eight randomized controlled trials. Regarding anxiety symptoms, digitally delivered cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and mind-body practice techniques emerged as valid strategies, while digital positive psychology and mindfulness-based interventions showed mixed results. On the other hand, digitally delivered dialectical behaviour therapy and positive psychology interventions have shown some efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms. Overall, the available literature, albeit of low quality, seems to support the role of digital interventions in promoting the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DSWs often experience workplace stress and burnout, resulting in a high turnover rate of employees within the non-professional disability service workforce. The full implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme in Australia is set to intensify the current challenges of attracting and retaining DSWs, as the role becomes characterised by greater demands, ambiguity and conflict. The aim of this study was to explore DSWs' perceptions of enjoyable and challenging aspects of disability support work, sources of stress and burnout and the strategies they use to cope when these issues arise. Twelve DSWs workers providing support for adults living with intellectual and physical disabilities were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed a superordinate theme of 'Balance' comprising three sub-themes: 'Balancing Negatives and Positives', 'Periods of Imbalance', and 'Strategies to Reclaim Balance'. Participants spoke of the rewarding and uplifting times in their job such as watching a client learn new skills and being shown appreciation. These moments were contrasted by emotionally and physically draining aspects of their work, including challenging client behaviour, earning a low income, and having limited power to make decisions. Participants described periods of imbalance, wherein the negatives of their job outweighed the positives, resulting in stress and sometimes burnout. Participants often had to actively seek support and tended to rely on their own strategies to manage stress. Findings suggest that organisational support together with workplace interventions that support DSWs to perceive the positive aspects of their work, such as acceptance and mindfulness-based approaches, may help to limit experiences of stress and burnout. The further development and evaluation of emotion-focused workplace therapies, and interventions that consider organisational (macro) factors is suggested.",

            "abstract": "Affective dysregulation is at the root of many psychopathologies, including stress induced disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression. The root of these disorders appears to be an attenuated, top-down cognitive control from the prefrontal cortices over the maladaptive subcortical emotional processing. A form of mental training, long-term meditation practice can trigger meditation-specific neuroplastic changes in the brain regions underlying cognitive control and affective regulation, suggesting that meditation can act as a kind of mental exercise to foster affective regulation and possibly a cost-effective intervention in mood disorders. Increasing research has suggested that the cultivation of awareness and acceptance along with a nonjudgmental attitude via meditation promotes adaptive affective regulation. This review examined the concepts of affective regulation and meditation and discussed behavioral and neural evidence of the potential clinical application of meditation. Lately, there has been a growing trend toward incorporating the \"mindfulness\" component into existing psychotherapeutic treatment. Promising results have been observed thus far. Future studies may consider exploring the possibility of integrating the element of \"compassion\" into current psychotherapeutic approaches.",

The current article seeks to explore if it can be scientifically determined that through mental training people can be led to act in a more sustainable manner with their mental forces and, at the same time, be significantly more efficient. The study sought to investigate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction on bachelor-level students' weekly test results. The results showed that there are significant differences between the experimental and the control group. Mindfulness-based stress reduction was influential in achieving higher scores and grades thus supporting our research hypothesis.

Uruguayan volunteer female teachers were randomly assigned to MSC or KY 9-week virtual training. They completed self-reported psychometric tests and an empathy for pain task (EPT) at pre- and post-training, and follow-up (3 months).ResultsAt post-MSC training, mindfulness (observing, non-reactivity, and total mindfulness) and self-compassion (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, and self-judgment) increased. The empathy dimensions perspective-taking increased and personal distress decreased. Stress decreased and well-being increased. Concerning EPT, the accuracy in attributing intentionality to the harm inflicted, i.e., the intentionality comprehension accuracy, increased. At follow-up, observing and total mindfulness remained elevated, and non-judging increased. Common humanity remained elevated and personal distress remained decreased. Comparing MSC with KY trainings at post-training, the psychometric tests showed that personal distress was lower in the MSC group. At follow-up, observing and total mindfulness were higher in the MSC group. No differences between groups were found for the EPT at post-training and follow-up.ConclusionsVirtual MSC training increased mindfulness and self-compassion, associated with higher well-being, reduced stress, and increased empathy in primary school teachers in Uruguay.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a mindful self-compassion (MSC) training program on self-compassion in the family caregivers of patients with cancer. Design/methodology/approachIn 2020, this quasi-experimental study used convenience sampling to select 92 family caregivers of patients with cancer presenting to the oncology ward of Seyed-Al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. The subjects randomly assigned to two groups participated in an online MSC program for 1.5 months. All the participants completed a self-compassion scale (Neff) before, immediately after and one month after the intervention. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Chi-squared test, the LSD test, the t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. FindingsThe total mean score of self-compassion, respectively, obtained as 64.64 +/- 8.23 and 64.44 +/- 4.94 in the experimental and control groups before the intervention significantly increased to 81.15 +/- 7.94 and 64.06 +/- 5.22 immediately after and 78.94 +/- 8.22 and 64.22 +/- 4.85 one month after the intervention (P < 0.001). Practical implicationsGiven the potential for negative psychological impacts for patients, caregivers and clinicians in cancer care, the online MSC program can be recommended to support and reduce psychological distress in them. Originality/valueThis paper examined the effect of the online MSC program on self-compassion in the family caregivers of patients with cancer and can contribute to our understanding of the value of integrating mental health of caregivers and care of patients with cancer.",

A feature of stroke is recurrence; 30-40% within five-years following first transient ischemic attack/stroke. Equipping patients with skills and coping strategies to help reduce or manage perceived psychological stress may represent an important secondary prevention intervention. Mindfulness-based interventions are structured, group-based self-management programmes with potential to help people with long-term conditions cope better with physical, psychological, or emotional distress. Review evidence suggests significant benefits across a range of physical and mental health problems. However, we could find no evidence synthesis relating specifically to the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions following transient ischemic attack/stroke.AimThe review aims to evaluate the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions following transient ischemic attack/stroke.MethodsSix major databases were searched using subject headings and key words. Papers were screened using review-specific criteria. Critical appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Statistical meta-analysis was not possible; therefore findings are presented in narrative form.ResultsFour studies involving 160 participants were reviewed. Three papers reported mindfulness-based interventions delivered to groups; one paper reported a mindfulness-based intervention which was delivered one to one. The results demonstrate a positive trend in favor of the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions across a range of psychological, physiological, and psychosocial outcomes including anxiety, depression, mental fatigue, blood pressure, perceived health, and quality of life.

Mindfulness-based interventions offer an evidence-based, mind-body complementary treatment approach for a wide range of comorbidities, yet most investigations were conducted with young or middle-aged adults. The purpose of this review was to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two leading mindfulness-based interventions conducted with older adults. Methods: Our search of five databases identified seven RCT investigations of either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) conducted exclusively with older adults. Results: Results generally supported the use of MBSR for chronic low back pain, chronic insomnia, improved sleep quality, enhanced positive affect, reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improved memory and executive functioning. In a sample of older adults exhibiting elevated anxiety in the absence of elevated depression, MBCT effectively reduced symptoms of anxiety. Conclusions: This review highlights the feasibility and possible benefits of MBSR and MBCT for older adults. Additional large scale RCTs conducted with older adults coping with the range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive challenges older adults commonly face still are needed.",

Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires at pre- and post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Baseline measures indicated moderate to severe range of mental health symptoms.Results: After the intervention, adolescents reported significant decreases in psychological distress and increases in mindfulness and self-esteem. Qualitative data revealed the intervention to be engaging and beneficial.

The goal of this literature review is to describe what research has shown about the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to support young children's self-regulation in early childhood settings. A total of 18 research studies conducted between 2010 and 2021 were identified. The main purposes of the studies reviewed were to examine the effects of MBIs on the development of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive self-regulation. Results showed that teachers generally found mindfulness practices feasible, acceptable, and effective in their classrooms. Although MBIs were found to have mixed effects on self-regulation in young children, positive effects on self-regulation were significantly greater for children in need of additional support, including those with difficulties or delays in developing self-regulation skills. The current review found a wide variety of MBIs used in early childhood settings globally. The results of this review suggest that teaching mindfulness practices to young children and their caregivers can both support the development of self-regulation of young children and foster socially and emotionally healthy environments in which this development can occur.",

This research aims to synthesize the evidence about whether MBIs reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs).Methods: Relevant studies were identified via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and the CINAHL database between 2009 and 2019. The papers selected focused on mindfulness and the effect of these on the BP of patients with NCDs. The change in SBP and DBP were meta-analyzed, stratified by type of intervention (Breathing awareness meditation (BAM), Mindfulness Meditation (MM), and Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR).Results: Fourteen articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. Among the studies using the type and duration of intervention, systolic BP was reduced after the mindfulness-based stress reduction for 8 weeks (-6.90 mmHg [95% CI: -10.82, -2.97], p < .050), followed by the breathing awareness meditation for 12 weeks (-4.10 mmHg [95% CI: -7.54, -0.66], p < .050) and the mindfulness-based intervention for 8 weeks (-2.69 mmHg [95% CI: -3.90, -1.49], p < .050) whereas diastolic BP was reduced after the mindfulness-based stress reduction for 8 weeks (-2.45 mmHg [95% CI: -3.74, -1.17], p < .050) and the mindfulness-based intervention for 8 weeks (-2.24 mmHg [95% CI: -3.22, -1.26], p < .050).Conclusion: MBIs can provide effective alternative therapies to assist in blood pressure reduction for patients with NCDs.",

For this purpose, this study aims to increase the academic resilience and mindfulness level of vocational high school students with a low socioeconomic background, who often have lower resilience toward learning English as a foreign language (EFL) in Tu''rkiye. The study adopted an experimental research design. Before and after an eight-session mindfulness-based intervention, the Academic Resilience Scale and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent measured the levels of mindfulness awareness and academic resilience. The pretest and posttest results in control and experimental groups were analyzed in SPSS, and independent samples t-test and analysis covariance analysis were conducted for data analysis. Focus-group interviews explored possible attributions toward mindfulness awareness and academic resilience, using MAXQDA. The results revealed that there is a significant difference between the groups in terms of academic resilience, but there is no significant difference in the case of mindfulness. On the other hand, most students reported that their academic resilience increased, and they had positive attitudes toward mindfulness-based practices. However, it was observed that their classmates' distractive and biased behaviors in the classroom setting mostly resulted in a lapse in their mindfulness.Mindfulness-based practices could foster academic resilience in socioeconomically disadvantaged vocational high schools. Teachers should be encouraged to adopt mindfulness-based practices throughout the term, rather than beyond immediate interventions, to achieve lasting benefits. Mindfulness-based practices may resist change compared to academic resilience due to short program duration, inexperienced practitioners, teachers' multiple tasks, and students' difficulties in maintaining focus.",

Increasing numbers of children, parents, and schools are participating in programs around the country with an enthusiasm that far exceeds the research support for their efficacy. Therapies that are safe but not effective may not cause immediate harm. Nevertheless, the misappropriation of limited time and financial resources may result in missed opportunities. The need for clearly defined, evidence-based therapies for youth with ASD is essential. Method Electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed intervention research studies using the key words autistic or autism in combination with yoga, mindfulness, or meditation. Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Results The findings are described in this critical review of eight empirical research studies that implemented yoga and mindfulness-based interventions for children with ASD. Although few studies reported improvements in core symptoms of ASD, preliminary findings suggest that yoga and mindfulness-based interventions are feasible and may improve a variety of prosocial behaviors, including communication and imitative behaviors; increased tolerance of sitting and of adult proximity; self-control; quality of life; and social responsiveness, social communication, social cognition, preoccupations, and social motivation. Reductions in aggressive behaviors, irritability, lethargy, social withdrawal, and noncompliance were also reported. Conclusions Based on the available literature, the empirical evidence to support the efficacy of yoga and mindfulness-based interventions for children and adolescents with ASD is inconclusive. The current body of research has significant limitations, including small sample sizes, no fidelity measures, and no control groups. Each of the eight studies, however, reported some positive effects on social, emotional, or behavioral metrics.

A total of 53 papers were identified for inclusion. Collectively, 92% of studies (employing various non-pharmacological interventions) found a variant of significant positive effect on either primary or secondary outcomes associated with ADHD. The strongest empirical support derived from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions. In addition, findings indicated support for the effectiveness of Mindfulness, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Neurofeedback. Other types of interventions also demonstrated effectiveness; however, support was limited due to lack of available research and methodological rigor. Psychological interventions should be considered a valid and useful addition to clinical practice. Implications and areas for future research are discussed.",

            "abstract": "There are more and more studies showing the effectiveness of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in well-being. However, there are few studies that explore the mechanisms underlying this effect. The aim of this study is to present and validate the Integrative Model of Mindfulness (MIM). MINI main hypothesis is that mindfulness practice leads to an increment in mindfulness trait, which leads to an increase of self compassion, and these in turn, lead to increase positive mental states towards others and oneself. A MBI intensive three-week with non-randomized controlled group was designed. Participants (N = 87) were differentiated by meditation experience as well. The results show large effect sizes regarding the effect of MBI on mindfulness trait, self-compassion and positive mental states to oneself and to others. The data support the MIM, indicating that the practice of mindfulness meditation leads in a sequentially way to the cultivation of mindfulness and self-compassion, which subsequently appears to lead to the development of positive mental states towards others and oneself.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: Among cancer survivors, mindfulness-based interventions appear promising in decreasing distress for cancer patients, but little attention has been paid to the ultimate mindfulness goal of increasing psychological wellbeing. This meta-analysis aims to summarise and synthesise available evidence concerning the effectiveness of MBIs on positive psychological outcomes reflecting key aspects of psychological wellbeing in heterogeneous cancer patients. Methods: A literature search of mindfulness-based randomised clinical trials in cancer survivors was conducted across six electronic databases. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Meta-analyses were conducted using R; standardised mean difference (SMD) was used to determine intervention effect. Moderators examined included therapeutic orientation, control group type, treatment modality, treatment target, heterogeneous vs. homogeneous cancer type, and facet of wellbeing. Results: Thirty-one studies were included (N = 2651). Those who received mindfulness-based interventions reported significantly higher eudaimonic, hedonic, and social wellbeing than respondents in control groups (SMD = 0.599). Interventions were equally effective across therapeutic orientation, control group type, treatment modality and treatment target. There were trend level differences favouring homogeneous cancer diagnosis groups over heterogeneous diagnosis groups. Conclusion: MBIs provide an effective treatment for increasing psychological wellbeing in cancer survivors. This finding has important implications for clinical practice.",

A limitation was not set for date of publication.Study Selection: The database searches resulted in 198 articles for abstract review, 7 of which remained after the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three randomized controlled trials and four descriptive studies were included in the review. Three studies included mothers as the only participants; the other studies included a small to moderate percentage of fathers.Data Extraction: Studies were reviewed for findings relevant to the relationship between mindfulness-based parenting interventions and symptoms of depression in parents according to their respective research designs.Data Synthesis: Analysis of the randomized controlled trials showed that mindfulness-based parenting interventions had significant positive treatment effects on symptoms of depression. Analysis of the descriptive studies showed significant inverse associations between mindfulness and depression scores. Although findings were consistent across the studies, the studies varied significantly in participant characteristics, intervention frequency and duration, and measurement tools.Conclusion: Further research is recommended with regard to the use of mindfulness-based parenting interventions to influence symptoms of depression in diverse populations. Samples of parents with culturally, economically, or racially diverse backgrounds have not been well-studied in relation to mindfulness-based parenting. Consistent use of frameworks, intervention types, and measurement tools across studies will strengthen the body of evidence.",

Recent evidence emphasises the potential benefits of addressing psychological factors associated with obesity in dietary programmes. This pilot study investigated the efficacy and acceptability of a combined online and face-to-face dietary intervention that used self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring to improve dietary behaviour, as well as psychological factors associated with dietary behaviour. Design: Embedded mixed methods including a 4-week before-after trial and a one-on-one interview. Quantitative outcomes of the study were the levels of self-compassion; eating pathology; depression, anxiety and stress; and dietary intake. Qualitative outcomes were participants' perceptions about the acceptability of the intervention. Setting: UNSW Kensington campus. Participants: Fourteen participants with overweight and obesity aged between 18 and 55 years old. Results: Results showed that the intervention significantly improved self-compassion and some aspects of dietary intake (e.g. decrease in energy intake) at Week Four compared with Week Zero. Some aspects of eating pathology also significantly decreased (e.g. Eating Concern). However, changes in self-compassion over the 4 weeks did not significantly predict Week Four study outcomes, except for level of stress. Most participants found self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring to be essential for dietary behaviour change. However, participants also indicated that an online programme needed to be efficient, simple and interactive. Conclusions: In conclusion, the current study provides preliminary but promising findings of an effective and acceptable combined online and face-to-face intervention that used self-compassion, goal-setting and self-monitoring to improve dietary habits. However, the results need to be examined in future long-term randomised controlled trials.",

            "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating, often chronic condition with substantial cross-national lifetime prevalence. Although mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may help reduce PTSD symptoms, efficacy results are inconsistent. Despite many systematic reviews (SRs) examining MBIs for PTSD, SR quality has been neither evaluated nor synthesized. We conducted an umbrella review to summarize and evaluate existing evidence regarding MBIs for PTSD, identifying 69 SRs (27 meta-analyses), consisting of 83 primary studies. Using AMSTAR2 (a valid SR quality assessment tool), we evaluated each SR on key domains relevant to methodological rigor and rated the confidence of inferences. Results found SRs were 65.2% non-rigorous, 27.5% likely rigorous, and 7.2% rigorous; common limitations included inadequate risk of bias assessment, extractions not completed in duplicate, and lack of pre-registration, highlighting the need for higher quality SRs. We then performed a meta-meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of MBIs to reduce PTSD symptoms, yielding a medium effect size (SMD=0.41, p < .001), derived from 22 meta-analyses (with replicable data) and 35 unique articles. Analyses were consistent across control conditions and MBI type (first-generation/narrow [i.e., MBIs with well-established protocols]) versus broad (i.e., other MBI types), comparable with second-line treatments (e.g., pharmacotherapy). Findings were narratively synthesized; areas for methodological improvements in MBI research were identified.",

In this structured literature review, a summary of the current evidence is presented, together with details of interventions undertaken and the tools to measure outcomes. It is broad in scope given the emerging evidence base in this area. The review yielded sixty-eight publications: twenty-three interventions in obese/overweight populations; twenty-nine interventions in normal-weight populations; sixteen observational studies, three of which were carried out in overweight/obese populations. Mindfulness-based approaches appear most effective in addressing binge eating, emotional eating and eating in response to external cues. There is a lack of compelling evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness and mindful eating in weight management. Mindfulness-based approaches may prevent weight gain. Reduced food intake was seen in some of the studies in overweight and obese populations, but this was less apparent in the studies in normal-weight populations. The evidence base for intuitive eating is limited to date and further research is needed to examine its potential in altering eating behaviours. Mindfulness appears to work by an increased awareness of internal, rather than external, cues to eat. Mindfulness and mindful eating have the potential to address problematic eating behaviours and the challenges many face with controlling their food intake. Encouraging a mindful eating approach would seem to be a positive message to be included in general weight management advice to the public.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness, whether distinguished as a state, trait, or training, is central to a growing wave of interest in meditation. Theoretical development has been called for in order to clarify confusion about mindfulness from a scientific perspective. Ideally, such development will allow ingress for more traditional perspectives and guide inclusive research on the wider range of meditation practices. To address this call, we outline a new approach for understanding mindfulness and related meditative experience that accommodates diverse perspectives. In accord with other integrative approaches, we employ foundational psychological constructs (namely, attention, intention, and awareness) to understand mindfulness. In contrast to other theoretical perspectives, however, we utilize this foundation to derive novel psychological constructs needed to better explain mindfulness and important features of meditative experience more widely. The contemplative cognition framework integrates three attention-related processes entailed by a variety of contemplative practices: intended attention, attention to intention, and awareness of transient information. After delineating this set of three processes, we explain how they can cooperate to promote a contemplative range of metacognition about attention, intention, and awareness, as well as enhanced regulation of cognition, emotion, and behavior. The contemplative cognition framework (a) overcomes discrepancies in mindfulness research; (b) accounts for contextual and motivational aspects of training; (c) supports investigation from phenomenological, information processing, neurophysiological, and clinical perspectives; and (d) enables investigations on various contemplative states, traits, and practices to inform one another. This new approach has potential for advancing a more inclusive, productive, and theory-driven science of mindfulness and meditation.",

Dysfunctions in interoception are found in several mental disorders, including trauma-related conditions. Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) have been shown to influence interoceptive processes. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated whether MBIs impact symptoms and interoception in patients with trauma-related disorders. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize these data. We included RCTs with an MBI arm which enrolled adult patients with trauma related-disorders or exposure to a traumatic experience, and addressed changes in interoception and trauma-related symptoms. A random-effects multivariate meta-analytic model was performed to quantify group differences in score change from baseline to follow-up. Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, and eleven in the meta-analysis. Overall, MBIs showed small to moderate positive effects on both interoception and symptoms. Despite a high heterogeneity in results, sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings. We conclude that the efficacy of MBIs on trauma-related symptoms and interoception is supported by randomised evidence. However, further research is needed to understand whether changes in interoception might underpin the effectiveness of MBIs in trauma-related disorders.",

Eight of them were measured quantitatively at baseline and post-intervention on clinical symptoms, depression and anxiety levels, quality of life and mindfulness.Results: Mixed qualitative and quantitative results supported MBI-p as an acceptable and feasible intervention. Significant statistical improvements were found in depression levels, mental quality of life, general psychopathology and ability to observe emotions and act with awareness. Qualitative comments suggested that the intervention was safe, enjoyable and had a positive impact on mood symptoms.

Each patient was taught the program in the first session, then exercised at home with a CD, and subsequently met the interviewer in a second session after 2 weeks. Primary physicians recruited the patients and interviews were conducted individually by nurses or psychologists with training in the program. Patients provided answers to pre- and post-intervention interviews about the meaning of their illness.Narrative data from the semi-structured interview were analyzed qualitatively. Pre-intervention, themes such as \"Effort to cope,\" \"Looking back,\" \"Spirituality,\" \"Personal growth,\" and \"Suffering\" were often chosen. Post-intervention, themes such as \"Adapted coping,\" \"Personal growth,\" \"Positive meaning,\" \"Spirituality,\" and \"Negative recognition\" were more commonly chosen.Mindfulness-based meditation therapy may be effective for producing adapted coping, including positive recognition and changes for an adapted lifestyle. There were some common aspects and some differences in the themes selected by patients in this study and Western patients received mindfulness therapy in other studies.",

            "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures were shown to impact negatively on people's mental health. In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female teachers (n= 66, age: 51.5 +/- 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality profiles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality profiles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR,n= 32) and a high-resilience (HR,n= 26) group. The LR and HR groups differed at baseline in most of the self-report measures. Pre-post MOM significant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, affective empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can effectively mitigate the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.",

            "abstract": "Compared to the extensive evidence of the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions, there is only a limited understanding of their mechanisms of change. The three aims of this study are (1) to identify features of self-organization during the process (e.g., pattern transitions), (2) to obtain an impression of the effects of continuous self-assessments and feedback sessions on mindfulness-related stress reduction, and (3) to test the feasibility of high-frequency process monitoring and process feedback. Concerning aim (1), the specific hypothesis is that change will occur as a cascade of discontinuous pattern transitions emerging spontaneously in the sense of not being a reaction to external input. This single case study describes changing patterns of multiple time series that were produced by app-based daily self-assessments during and after an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. After this MBSR program, the participant (a female nurse) continued the self-assessment and the mindfulness practice for a further 10 months. The results confirm findings on the positive effects of mindfulness programs for healthcare professionals, especially on coping with work-related stress. The analysis of the time series data supports the hypothesis of self-organization as a possible mechanism of change manifesting as a cascade of phase transitions in the dynamics of a biopsychosocial system. At the end of the year, the participant reported a beneficial impact of daily monitoring and systematic feedback on the change process. The results underline the feasibility and usefulness of continuous high-frequency monitoring during and after mindfulness interventions.",

            "abstract": "Many people with depression or anxiety turn to nonpharmacologic and nonconventional interventions, including exercise, yoga, meditation, tai chi, or qi gong. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown that these interventions can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. As an adjunctive treatment, exercise seems most helpful for treatment-resistant depression, unipolar depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Yoga as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy shows positive effects, particularly for depression. As an adjunctive therapy, it facilitates treatment of anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder. Tai chi and qi gong may be helpful as adjunctive therapies for depression, but effects are inconsistent. As monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy, mindfulness-based meditation has positive effects on depression, and its effects can last for six months or more. Although positive findings are less common in people with anxiety disorders, the evidence supports adjunctive use. There are no apparent negative effects of mindfulness-based interventions, and their general health benefits justify their use as adjunctive therapy for patients with depression and anxiety disorders.

Neither trait mindfulness or mindful parenting acted as moderators between child behavior problems and outcome variables, although both had main effect (compensatory) associations with parent outcomes.

There is a need for the use of an MBAT intervention that can be delivered in any setting for adults with MS. The purpose of this pilot feasibility study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of an MBAT intervention delivered via videoconference. METHODS: We developed an MBAT intervention to be delivered by videoconference to adults with MS recruited from an academic center registry. We also conducted phone interviews to collect acceptability data. RESULTS: Most of the participants (n = 5) were very positive about the MBAT video sessions and stated content as clear and easy to follow and understand.

            "abstract": "Background: Teaching is recognized as a highly challenging profession. Experience of chronic stress is a risk factor for poor mental and physical well-being, and burnout. There is limited knowledge regarding optimal interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Objective: To undertake a scoping review of the literature in the last five years to determine various psychological interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Method: The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was followed. Relevant search terms were used to determine different interventions adopted to reduce teachers' stress and burnout. Articles published between 2018 and 2022 were identified using five bibliographic databases. Relevant articles were extracted, reviewed, collated, and thematically analyzed, and findings s were summarized. Results: Forty studies conducted in Asia, North America, Oceania, Europe, and Africa, met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen kinds of burnout and stress-reduction interventions were identified. The most popularly studied intervention were Mindfulness-Based Interventions alone or in combination with yoga or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), followed by Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT). Mindfulness-Based Interventions led to decreased overall Teacher Stress Inventory (TSI) and emotional exhaustion subscale scores. REBT, primarily used with special education teachers, especially in Africa, has also shown positive results. Other interventions reporting positive outcomes include Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR), the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program (SMART), Cyclic Meditation, Group Sandplay, Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Autogenic Training, Sport-Based Physical Activity, Emotional Intelligence Ability Models and Christian Prayer and Prayer-Reflection. Conclusions: Stress and burnout can have a negative impact on teachers and, very often, on the students they teach. Implementing suitable school-based interventions is necessary to improve teachers' stress-coping ability, reduce the likelihood of burnout and improve general well-being. Policymakers, governments, school boards and administrators should prioritize the implementation of school-based awareness and intervention programs.",

            "abstract": "Few empirical studies have explored the associations between formal and informal mindfulness home practice and outcome in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). In this study ninety-nine participants randomised to MBCT in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial completed self-reported ratings of home practice over 7 treatment weeks. Recurrence of Major Depression was assessed immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months post-treatment. Results identified a significant association between mean daily duration of formal home practice and outcome and additionally indicated that participants who reported that they engaged in formal home practice on at least 3 days a week during the treatment phase were almost half as likely to relapse as those who reported fewer days of formal practice. These associations were independent of the potentially confounding variable of participant-rated treatment plausibility. The current study identified no significant association between informal home practice and outcome, although this may relate to the inherent difficulties in quantifying informal home mindfulness practice. These findings have important implications for clinicians discussing mindfulness-based interventions with their participants, in particular in relation to MBCT, where the amount of participant engagement in home practice appears to have a significant positive impact on outcome.

            "abstract": "Commonly conducted mindfulness-based trainings such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) highlight training in two key forms of meditation: focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM). Largely unknown is what each of these mindfulness practices contributes to emotional and other important training outcomes. This dismantling trial compared the effects of structurally equivalent trainings in MBCT, FA, and OM on neural and subjective markers of emotional reactivity and regulation among community adults, with the aim to better understand which forms of training represent active ingredients in mindfulness trainings. Participants with varying levels of depressive symptoms were randomized to one of the three trainings. Before and after each 8-week training, N = 89 participants completed a modified version of the Emotional Reactivity and Regulation Task while electroencephalographic (EEG) and self-reported emotional responses to negative, positive, and neutral photographic images were collected. Examination of EEG-based frontal alpha band asymmetry during passive viewing (reactivity) and active regulation phases of the task showed that FA and MBCT trainings produced significant leftward hemispheric shifts in frontal alpha asymmetry, commonly associated with a shift toward approach-based positive affect. Self-reported emotional responses to negative images corroborated these results, suggesting salutary changes in both emotional reactivity and regulation. OM training had limited beneficial effects, restricted to the subjective outcomes. The findings suggest that MBCT may derive its greatest benefit from training in FA rather than OM. Discussion highlights the potential value of FA training for emotional health.",

            "abstract": "The increased popularity of mindfulness-based interventions and the growing body of empirical evidence confirming the positive effects of these interventions on well-being warrant more research to determine if the effects are indeed related to learning mindfulness. The present study extends previous studies, by examining whether and how changes in five core aspects of mindfulness are related to changes in the report of negative and positive affect during an 8-week course of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. The study was performed in 64 individuals from the community with mild to moderate psychological problems. Data were collected by self-report questionnaires before and directly after the training. Results showed significant decreases in negative affect and increases in positive affect. We also found significant increases in four of the five aspects of mindfulness. Importantly, changes in mindfulness were significantly associated with improved affect, with a distinct pattern found for positive and negative affect. Hereby, our findings extend previous research by showing that learning distinct aspects of mindfulness is differently related to an improved positive affect and a decreased negative affect. Future randomized controlled trials with a larger sample and longer follow-up period are needed to replicate these findings.",

Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies were included if they (1) evaluated MBIs (2) for patients with cancer or cancer survivors (3) regarding their impact on coping with cancer and perceived self-efficacy. The reports were screened by two independent reviewers and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. The review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022368765).ResultsFindings from 28 reports of 19 quantitative studies, six qualitative studies, and three mixed-methods studies (total N = 1722) were extracted and integrated. The synthesis of quantitative data showed considerable heterogeneity in outcomes and measurement instruments. Most often reported were significant positive impacts of mindfulness on general coping skills, self-regulation, and perceived efficacy in coping with cancer. Qualitative interviews with patients supported those results. The three meta-themes identified were that MBI (1) provided patients with tools to use in stressful situations, (2) promoted a general change of mindset and (3) created a feeling of social connectedness.ConclusionsThe reviewed studies suggest that MBI can promote coping and enhance the perceived self-efficacy of patients with cancer. In the future, more research investigating the different aspects of coping and the potentially moderating role of self-efficacy could provide further insights with respect to how coping and self-efficacy related to MBI.",

            "abstract": "Background: Since 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has spread around the world, and health care workers, as frontline workers, have faced tremendous psychological stress.Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore whether web-based mindfulness-based interventions continue to have a positive impact on anxiety, depression, and stress among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) participants were frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the experimental group was a web-based mindfulness-based intervention; (3) the control group used either general psychological intervention or no intervention; (4) outcome indicators included scales to assess anxiety, depression, and stress; and (5) the study type was a randomized controlled study. Studies that did not meet the above requirements were excluded. We searched 9 databases, including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, for randomized controlled studies on the effects of web-based mindfulness-based interventions on common mental disorder symptoms among health care workers from January 1, 2020, to October 20, 2022. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Subgroup analysis was used to look for sources of heterogeneity and to explore whether the results were the same for subgroups under different conditions. Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the stability of the pooled results.Results: A total of 10 randomized controlled studies with 1311 participants were included. The results showed that web-based mindfulness-based interventions were effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety (standard mean difference [SMD]=-0.63, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.31, P<.001, I-2=87%), depression (SMD=-0.52, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.26, P<.001, I-2=75%), and stress (SMD=-0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05, P=.01, I-2=58%) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with wide CIs and high heterogeneity.Conclusions: Web-based mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress among frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is critical to have effective strategies to address the unique stressors of a medical career, mitigate burnout, and buffer the physiologic toll of chronic stress. Using Zwack and Schweitzer's widely published description of approaches to maintaining resilience and approaches to wellness, we have organized these strategies into three broad domains relevant to medical practice: (1) gratification (connection and communication, meaning and purpose); (2) resilience building practices (self-reflection, time for oneself, self-compassion, spirituality); and (3) useful attitudes (acceptance, flexibility, self-awareness). Several techniques are described including mindfulness-based stress reduction, narrative medicine, skillful communication, and practices in self-compassion, gratitude, and spirituality. The focus of the work is to introduce a spectrum of resilience strategies for individual consideration that can be tailored and combined to meet a physician's changing needs over the course of medical training and practice.",

We analyzed interviews according to reflexive thematic analysis, and coded data into three main themes: 1) Impact of MBSR on surgery experiences; 2) Contributors to change; and 3) Motivations for participation. Participants noted they were able to relax, feel more confident, and cope more effectively during the preoperative period, and that others in their lives noticed positive changes following their participation in MBSR. Participants' openness to mindfulness and health-related beliefs and may have contributed to the positive impacts they experienced from MBSR. Participants described being motivated to participate in MBSR to help them prepare for their surgery and to learn new coping strategies. Participants described a strong level of commitment to the intervention. With further research, integration of MBSR into prehabilitation for TKA may be appropriate.

Results A total of 1,297 participants were included in this study. 6.7% of them reported SI. Marriage (AOR = 0.389, P = 0.003) and peace of mind (AOR = 0.854, P < 0.001) were negatively associated with SI. History of psychological or emotional counseling before COVID-19 infection (AOR = 1.889, P = 0.049), fatigue (AOR = 1.110, P = 0.007), higher self-reported COVID-19 related stigma (AOR = 1.054, P = 0.003) and sleep disorder (AOR = 1.112, P = 0.001) were positively associated with SI. Conclusions Consideration should be taken into account to develop appropriate alleviating measures such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to reduce the rates of SI among COVID-19 survivors and improve their resilience to cope with the personal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "abstract": "This review set out to provide empirical literature on mindfulness-based strengths practice (MBSP), a new approach in positive psychology that integrates mindfulness with character strengths, two positive predictors of well-being. First, the conceptualization of integrating character strengths and mindfulness into MBSP is discussed. The literature on the interrelatedness of character strengths and mindfulness is then described, along with ways that the intervention of MBSP encourages positive outcomes at various levels. The literature search returned 7 (10 samples, N = 3,851) studies supporting a positive association between character strengths and mindfulness (r = 0.3-0.4) and the mediating role of character strengths/virtues in mindfulness and mindfulness's role in enhancing character strengths toward psychological well-being. The nine MBSP intervention studies (9 samples, N = 354) conducted in diverse contexts provide evidence of a significant improvement in well-being, engagement, life satisfaction, mindfulness, positive affect, character strengths, work-related outcomes, heightened birthing parents' well-being during pregnancy and childbirth, increased academic performance, and enhanced mental health among students. The intervention studies also reported the fostering of mindful positive parenting and contributions to a significant reduction in negative psychological states, such as stress, depression, anxiety, and negative affect. This comprehensive review provides empirical support for the MBSP framework and its positive impact on well-being across various domains, including organizations, education, healthcare, and family. However, it underscores the need for more extensive research, as the current literature on MBSP is limited. The review encourages future studies to explore MBSP applications in diverse domains, thereby paving the way for a deeper understanding of its potential benefits.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions are commonly used to reduce psychological symptoms and enhance positive qualities of human functioning. However, the influence of mindfulness practice dosage remains poorly understood, limiting dissemination and implementation efforts. The current study examined the association between practice dosage and several constructs related to psychological functioning (positive and negative affect, state mindfulness) over the course of a standardized mindfulness-based intervention (Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement). Twenty-live participants completed daily diary assessments for 12 weeks. Two-part gamma regression models examined the dichotomous (did practice occur?) and continuous (how much practice?) components of practice minutes. Practice time and outcomes showed same-day relationships in the expected directions. Lagged models, however, showed no evidence that current day practice time predicts subsequent day outcomes. In contrast, higher current day negative affect predicted less subsequent day practice time. and higher current day mindfulness predicted more subsequent day practice time. In a post hoc analysis, practice time moderated the link between day-to-day affect, strengthening the link for positive affect and weakening the link for negative affect. Collectively, these findings suggest that the causal direction linking practice time and outcome may flow from outcome to practice time, rather than the reverse-with potential recursive relationships between these factors. Further examination of lagged relationships between practice time and outcome as well as random assignment of participants to varying practice dosages (e.g., in within-person microrandomized trials) may help clarify the influence of this central treatment ingredient within mindfulness-based interventions.",

For decades, medical professionals have been searching for solutions to assist those who are suffering from this illness. The use of drugs has not been a sufficient means of treatment to alleviate depression and its symptoms. There is a dire need to expand therapeutic interventions that can attribute meaningful recovery for victims of depression. One means of positive treatment is the use of prayer. Prayer, one of the most ancient forms of meditation, aligns and relaxes the mental state of the mind. The uses of drugs are limited by physiological focus, but prayer is a mechanism that brings human beings into a unique state of oneness. Oneness comprises the holistic nature of a human being and asserts the triad of well-being: mind, body, and spirit. As the emergence of humanities and holism continues in medicine, centering/meditative prayer and similar practices like mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can be useful therapeutic interventions specifically for major depressed patients.",

Method: A qualitative evaluation design with a purposive criterion sample (n = 5) was used to investigate the impact of a Brief Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR-B) intervention on the experience of stress in after-degree nursing students. Results: Thematic analysis of participants' narratives resulted in the identification of four categories: (a) hitting a reset button, (b) self-compassion, (c) avoiding a downward spiral, and (d) using an internal coping mechanism. These findings suggested a metatheme of self-awareness involving more efficient and effective detection and management of stress. Conclusion: The positive impact for participants in this study suggests that stress management for after-degree nursing students through the use of an MBSR-B intervention is worthy of nurse educators' consideration.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancerous disease worldwide. Its treatment leads to a variety of physiological and psychological side effects. This review investigates the question of how mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a stress management program, can influence the quality of life, anxiety, and depression of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Library. Screening by title, abstract and full text was performed, whereby only those articles were included that fit the inclusion criteria. A risk of bias assessment was performed for each included study. Results: Overall, six studies were included, but not every study investigated all three outcomes. Two studies found positive impacts on quality of life, whereas three did not find a positive correlation between the intervention and quality of life. Four out of six studies found a positive relation between MBSR and anxiety scores, but only half of the included studies found positive results for the interaction between MBSR and depression scores. Conclusion: Published data suggest that anxiety can be positively influenced by MBSR, which can be used to improve the psychological care of breast cancer patients, both during and after treatment. However, further studies with larger patient numbers and longer observation periods should be conducted in order to elucidate the full potential of MSBR on important areas such as depression and quality of life.",

            "abstract": "ObjectiveAlthough meditation practice is an important component of many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), empirical findings of its effects on psychological functioning aremixed and the mechanisms for the effects remain unclear. Responding with mindfulness (i.e., returning one's attention back to anonjudgmental, present-oriented awareness) is a fundamental skill practiced in meditations. With repeated meditation practice, this skill isthought to become internalized and be applied to one's daily life. We thus hypothesized that the extent to which individuals responded to dailyevents with mindfulness would mediate the effects of meditation practice (instance, duration, and adherence to instructions) on psychological well-being.MethodUsing a daily diary methodology, we tracked the meditation practice, use of mindful responding during the day, and psychological outcomes (perceived stress, negative and positive affect) of 117 mindfulness-based stress reduction program participants.ResultsWe found that on days when participants meditated, they responded with greater mindfulness to daily events, which accounted for the beneficial effects of meditating on psychological outcomes. Furthermore, findings suggest that on meditation days, longer and more closely adhered meditation practices were independently associated with increases in mindful responding, which in turn were associated with better psychological outcomes.ConclusionThese results suggest that regular, longer, and more closely adhered meditation practice is an important component of MBIs, in part because it leads to responding more mindfully in daily life,which promotes well-being.

Research conducted in adults and emerging research conducted in adolescents has shown that mindfulness-based interventions can improve outcomes in several areas. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent research on the effects of mindfulness and suggest exercises that primary care clinicians can offer to their adolescent patients.Recent findingsResearch has shown positive effects of mindfulness across several health conditions commonly encountered during adolescence. Mindfulness-based Interventions can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. The application of mindfulness can help with the prevention and treatment of binge eating, over-eating, and restrictive eating disorders. In the treatment of substance use disorders, mindfulness can improve emotion regulation and reduce symptoms of withdrawal and craving. Mindfulness can also lead to improvement in overall quality of life for patients suffering from chronic pain. Lastly, mindfulness can be useful for adolescents with ADHD, sleep problems, chronic illness, and stress related to performance sports.SummaryAlthough research in adolescents remains limited, mindfulness holds promise in the treatment of a range of health conditions in adolescents.",

Post-migration barriers limit immigrant women's access to supportive services, which can further debilitate their mental health symptoms and their safety. The Being safe, Healthy, and Positively Empowered (BSHAPE) digital intervention was designed to address physical safety and healthcare needs of immigrant women through a multi-component approach that integrated mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) practices. This paper reports qualitative feedback findings from eighteen Black immigrant women with recent IPV exposure and co-occurring mental health symptoms, who participated in the mindfulness sessions of BSHAPE. We identified elements of mindfulness that women perceived as beneficial in their healing. Women's feedback indicated healing and empowerment through positive appraisals and coping strategies. The benefits were noted for mindfulness elements promoting self-compassion, self-actualization, intentionality of moving forward in life, and developing positivity or a sense of optimism. Other helpful elements were relaxation, self-care and reflection, self-awareness, self-control and focused thinking. Our findings show that incorporating mindfulness practices in interventions can be beneficial for promoting the healing and empowerment of immigrant women in abusive relationships.",

            "abstract": "Background The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is high worldwide, and patients with COPD commonly suffer from mood disorders, such as symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, it is difficult to communicate with patients face to face to solve these psychological problems in the case of the fluctuations in symptoms of COPD and COVID-19 prevalence, which may lead to the fact that patients with COPD are more likely to suffer exacerbations, frequent readmissions and worse survival. Mindfulness-based interventions are a stress-reducing therapy with mindfulness at its core. Remote mindfulness-based interventions combine the advantages of high availability, accessibility, low cost and anonymity and can solve the barriers to access that many patients face when attending face-to-face programmes. Therefore, remote mindfulness-based interventions may be an effective way to improve the mental health of patients with COPD. Methods and analysis We will search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, PsycNET, MEDLINE, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection and Web of Science to select eligible studies that were published. The eligible studies will be screened, extracted and then the methodological quality will be evaluated independently by two reviewers.

However, the research evaluating the efficacy of this approach, and other innovative treatments for mood disorders, has mainly been with people under 65 years. This paper aims to help redress this imbalance by exploring older people's own reflections of their experience of MBCT.Methods: A qualitative approach was used to explore 13 participants' experiences of MBCT; participants were interviewed pre and post-intervention and again after six months. To see whether the standard course requires any adaptations for older participants, the two MBCT course facilitators were interviewed post-intervention.Results: Thematic analysis identified five overarching themes and showed that older people reported positive changes in their mental health and well-being and reported being released from the past'. The facilitators reported that they needed to be aware of later life issues, such as loneliness and potential physical limitations, but otherwise only minor adaptations were needed to the standard MBCT course for older people.Conclusion: MBCT is an acceptable approach for people aged 65 years and over and further research should explore potential mechanisms of change including changes in meta-cognitive awareness and self-compassion.",

However, most studies focus on these two groups separately. This study examined whether it would be possible and beneficial for people with dementia and their caregiver to jointly undergo an adjusted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, named TANDEM.Methods: The 8-week MBSR training was adjusted based on a literature review and interviews with experts (clinicians and mindfulness trainers). Seven couples (a person with early-stage dementia and their caregiver) participated together in the 8-week TANDEM program. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted after completion. Questionnaires (administered before and after the intervention) assessed the primary outcomes of quality of life and psychological distress (stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes were mindfulness, self-compassion, positive mental health, worrying, and perceived burden (for caregivers).Results: All participants completed the program and reported beneficial effects (relaxation, awareness, acceptance, and resilience). Most managed to integrate exercises into their daily lives and planned to continue their practice. Participating in a group was considered valuable and supportive. Furthermore, it was appreciated that participants could follow the training together (as a couple). The quantitative results showed a small effect on increased quality of life for caregivers. No substantial decrease in psychological distress was apparent. Caregivers displayed a large increase in mindfulness.Conclusion: The results of this mixed-methods study suggest that an adjusted mindfulness program is feasible and well-received among couples of persons with early-stage dementia and their caregiver, warranting further research in this area.",

Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on psychological variables and the perspectives and experiences of patients with an SSc diagnosis. Notably, 32 SSc patients were enrolled and assigned to either the intervention (MBSR) group or the waitlist group. Inclusion criteria were (i) age \u2265 18 years, SSc diagnosis according to EULAR/ACR diagnostic criteria and informed consent. Exclusion criteria were previous participation in any Mind-Body Therapy or psychiatric diagnosis. Quantitative and qualitative outcomes were investigated through clinometric questionnaires and individual interviews. MBSR did not significantly impact outcomes such as physical functionality, anxiety, hopelessness, depression, physical health status, perceived stress, mindfulness and mental health status. For the anger evaluation, statistically significant differences are found for both controlling and expressing anger, indicating that the MBSR program had a favorable impact. As for qualitative results, more awareness of daily activities, stress reduction in terms of recognizing the causes and implementing self-strategies to prevent them, adherence to therapy, and recognition of the effect of medication on their bodies were reported. In conclusion, it is important to highlight the absence of negative or side effects of the MBSR program and the positive impact on patients' experience and perspective; thus, we suggest this approach should be taken into account for SSc patients.",

Responding to these challenges will require a multipronged approach, focusing on system level, organization, and individual actions. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) represent a promising area for individual action. This systematic review indicates that PPI, delivered via many methods, holds promise for improving the well-being of healthcare workers, although there is a clear need for additional randomized controlled trials utilizing defined and standardized outcome measures. In this review, the most commonly evaluated PPIs were mindfulness-based or gratitude -based interventions. These were delivered via different methods, with many administered in the workplace and commonly in the form of courses ranging from two days to eight weeks. Researchers documented measurable improvements in multiple studied outcomes, noting reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, burnout, and stress. Some interventions increased well-being, job and life satisfaction, self -compassion, relaxation, and resilience. Most studies emphasized that these are simple, accessible, low-cost interventions. Limitations included some nonrandomized or quasi-experimental designs, alongside generally small sample sizes and varying methods of intervention delivery. Another concern is the lack of standardized outcome assessments and long-term follow-up data. As almost all studies included were performed before the pandemic, further research will be required post-pandemic. Overall, however, PPI shows promise as one arm of a multipronged approach to improving the well-being of healthcare workers.",

Fifty-seven participants were recruited from the community and randomized into either the modified MBSR group (n = 27) or modified MBCT group (n = 26), receiving seven face-to-face intervention sessions for more than 16 weeks. Various psychological outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), immediately after intervention (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2).Results: Both interventions were found to be feasible in view of the high attendance (more than 70.0%) and low attrition (3.8%) rates. The mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed positive within-group effects on perceived stress (p =.030, Cohen's d = 0.54), depressive symptoms (p =.002, Cohen's d = 0.77), and subjective caregiver burden (p <.001, Cohen's d = 1.12) in both interventions across the time points, whereas the modified MBCT had a larger effect on stress reduction, compared with the modified MBSR (p =.019).Conclusion: Both the modified MBSR and MBCT are acceptable to family caregivers of PWD. Their preliminary effects were improvements in stress, depressive symptoms, and subjective burden. The modified MBCT may be more suitable for caregivers of PWD than the MBSR.

            "abstract": "BackgroundA mindfulness-based intervention that reduces comorbid pain, anxiety, and substance use during office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) could enhance retention and prevent overdose. We conducted a pilot study of the Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC), a 24-week trauma-informed program with a motivationally-sensitive curriculum. MethodsPatients prescribed buprenorphine (N = 18) enrolled in M-ROCC. We collected urine toxicology biweekly. At 0, 4, and 24 weeks, participants completed PROMIS-Pain, PROMIS-Anxiety, Mindfulness (FFMQ), Experiential Avoidance (BEAQ), Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and Self-Compassion (SCS-SF) scales. We estimated changes over time using mixed models. Participants completed qualitative interviews at 4 and 24 weeks. ResultsPositive urine toxicology decreased over time for cocaine (beta = -.266, p = .008) and benzodiazepines (beta = -.208, p = .028). M-ROCC reduced PROMIS-Pain (Z = -2.29; p = .022), BEAQ (Z = -2.83; p = .0005), and increased FFMQ (Z = 3.51; p < .001), MAIA (Z = 3.40; p = .001), and SCS-SF (Z = 2.29; p = .022). Participants with co-morbid anxiety had decreased PROMIS-Anxiety (Z = -2.53; p = .012). Interviewed participants commonly used mindfulness practices for stress and anxiety (12/12, 100%), and to reduce pain catastrophizing and rumination (7/12, 58%). Conclusion and Scientific SignificanceThis is the first study to report the effects of a 24-week mindfulness program during buprenorphine treatment on common comorbidities, including pain interference, anxiety, cocaine, and benzodiazepine use. The findings that M-ROCC is associated with reduced experiential avoidance, as well as increased interoceptive awareness and self-compassion, align with proposed mechanisms that are now extended to OUD treatment. Future larger randomized controlled trials are needed before effectiveness can be established and the role of these mechanisms can be confirmed.",

            "abstract": "Parents of children with intellectual disabilities and/or autism have been shown to experience higher levels of distress than other parents. Despite such data having been available for several decades, the evidence base for psychological interventions to support parental well-being is small. Recent data suggest that both mindfulness and acceptance processes are associated with decreased psychological distress for parents of children with intellectual disability and/or autism. In addition, some controlled evaluations of mindfulness-based interventions for these parents have resulted in positive outcomes for mothers in particular. In the present study 18 mothers and 3 fathers were recruited via special schools who then attended a Mindfulness Based Well-Being for Parents (MBW-P) group over eight weeks. Parents completed questionnaire measures before and at the end of the course. Statistical analysis showed significant reported increases in mindfulness and self-compassion, and reduced general stress. Parents also reported reductions in anxiety and depression, although these changes were not statistically significant. No significant reductions in their child's behaviour problems or increases in the child's prosocial behaviour were found. Parents also reported high levels of satisfaction with the course. These preliminary data suggest that further research studies testing the effectiveness of the MBW-P course are warranted.",

            "abstract": "Background Cancer diagnosis and treatment can cause fatigue, stress and anxiety which can have a detrimental effect on patients, families and the wider community. Mindfulness-based interventions appear to have positive effects on managing these cancer-related symptoms. Objective To investigate the efficacy of mindfulness on cancer related fatigue (CRF) and psychological well-being in female cancer patients. Methods Five databases (CINHAL, Ovid Medline, Ovid Psych Info, Scopus, and Cochrane), and two trial registers (WHO and Clinicaltrials.gov) were searched for randomised control trials from inception to April 2021 and updated in August 2022. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4. The standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine the intervention effect. Subgroup analysis was performed for adaptation to types of mindfulness, length of intervention and types of comparator used. Results Twenty-one studies with a total of 2326 participants were identified. Mindfulness significantly improved CRF (SMD -0.81, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.44), depression (SMD-0.74, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.39) and anxiety (SMD -0.92, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.33). No effect was observed for quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.13-0.87) and sleep (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.34-0.04). Subgroup analysis revealed that there was little difference in SMD for adapted type of mindfulness (p = 0.42), wait list control compared to active comparator (p = 0.05) or length of intervention (p = 0.29). Conclusion Mindfulness appears to be effective in reducing CRF and other cancer related symptoms in women. Adaptations to mindfulness delivery did not have negative impact on results which may aid delivery in the clinical settings.",

            "abstract": "There has been growing research indicating the potential positive benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for obesity, but few studies have examined the relationship of mindfulness processes to obesity-related behaviors, particularly among clinical populations such as bariatric surgery candidates. The current study examined the relationship of specific mindfulness facets to a variety of problematic eating behaviors assessed through diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of 820 patients seeking bariatric surgery. Results indicated that greater mindfulness on specific facets, particularly acting with awareness, was related to less binge and emotional eating. Greater mindfulness was also related, though less consistently, to less habitual overeating and grazing. The observing facet was generally unrelated to problematic eating, but in a few cases being more observant related to having greater eating problems. The results of the study and future directions are discussed in relation to research on problematic eating in obesity and mindfulness-based interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

            "abstract": "The field of mindfulness research and programs, in the workplace and elsewhere, has been a matter of considerable ambiguity and contestation. Distinguishing between first-generation and second-generation mindfulness-based initiatives has been a useful and positive response to this uncertainty and controversy. Second-generation mindfulness interventions in leadership are defined as going beyond views of mindfulness as a means to reduce the stress inherent in continual change, and as instrumental support for organizational performance in an economy of attention. The purpose of this paper is to build on this work in two ways. Firstly, it acknowledges the contribution of first-generation psychological-therapeutic programs. Secondly, it highlights the value of extending the range and depth of Buddhist-derived interventions beyond such programs and most importantly, also capturing and exploring the value of critical and collective approaches to mindfulness that derive from other traditions and schools of thought. In order to guide such a progression, this paper presents a Wheel of Mindfulness model that captures the different, and inevitably selective, lenses on mindfulness, and provides a generative framework for exploring and building on sources of controversy and debate.",

Latest discoveries in neuroscience and scientific research in mindfulness, have bridged the science and practice of mindfulness providing evidence on its positive effects on human-centred teaching and learning. Regular mindfulness practice can alter the function and structure of the brain and help learners train their mind to, among other skills, pay attention in a purposeful way and not get distracted by the abundance of external and internal stimuli. It can promote learners' awareness, self-regulation, and other metacognitive skills so they become more resilient and ready to face the challenges of the increasingly-overwhelming digital world.",

The study was conducted in three classrooms with elementary-age students. The intervention was delivered via the Headspace application. Data were collected using systematic direct observation. The research design was a multiple baseline design. Each classroom was the unit of analysis. Data were analyzed using visual analysis and by calculating a between-case standardized mean difference. Results showed a nonsignificant, small effect size (g = 0.53, (95% CI [-0.15, 1.22]). Overall, results from the visual analysis suggest there was not a functional relation between Headspace and attentive behavior. The perceptions of Headspace by instructors were not positive. The results differ from previous results in the literature and are interpreted considering limitations related to the planning/design of the study as well as its execution.Headspace, a self-administered mindfulness program, implemented for 6 min daily with minimal interventionist input using Headspace kids sessions, may not improve students' attentive behavior Instructors' perceptions of Headspace as an intervention were largely unfavorable; the majority of instructors with pre-post data slightly agreed the intervention was acceptable but disagreed or strongly disagreed about it being effective. Although results from the current study did not support Headspace as an effective Tier 1 intervention, it is conceptually one that fits well within that tier of support. However, results suggested that more involvement by instructional staff may be important to students benefitting from the intervention. If future research were to provide more support for Headspace as an effective intervention for attentive behavior, schools that choose to implement Headspace as a mindfulness-based intervention may benefit from training teachers to take a more active role in the implementation of the intervention.",

Mindfulness-based stress management is a tool that has effectively been utilized in several disciplines and has potential applications to eating behaviors. This paper describes the effects of an exploratory mindfulness-based stress management and nutrition education program, the Slow Down Program, on mothers' perceived stress, eating behavior, and self-efficacy.Design & setting: This study used a mixed methods quasi-experimental design. Nineteen mothers with young children (five or younger) participated in the study. The SDP consisted of four consecutive weekly 1.5 h sessions focused on experiential learning and facilitated discussion.Main outcome measures: Quantitative data were collected pre-and post-intervention and included: the Perceived Stress Scale; Mindfulness Self-Efficacy Scale; and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised-18. Qualitative data included a focus group post-intervention and an individual interview 4-6 weeks post-intervention.Results: The SDP showed significant improvements in participants' perceived stress (p = .04), uncontrolled eating (p < 0.01), cognitive restraint (p < 0.01), and mindfulness self-efficacy (p < 0.01). Qualitatively, participants also reported changes in self-efficacy and eating behaviors-specifically improvements in mindful eating, and sensory and satiety awareness.Conclusions: The results of this pilot study demonstrate that nutrition programs incorporated with mindfulness strategies may offer positive, short-term impacts on stress reduction and eating behaviors.

First, the importance of quality of life as a target of recovery-oriented clinical work is considered. Second, the recent staging approach to BD is described, and we outline implications for psychosocial interventions tailored to stage. Finally, we review evidence suggesting that mindfulness-based psycho social interventions have potential across early, middle and late stages of BD. It is concluded that the humanistic emphasis of the recovery paradigm provides a timely stimulus for development of a next generation of psycho social treatments for people with BD.

The objective of this exploratory qualitative study was to describe the experiences and perceived attitudinal and behavioral changes of women participating in a mindful eating program. Design:Focus group discussions were held with women participating in a community-based mindful eating program for binge and emotional eating. A semistructured interview guide was used to explore participants' conceptualizations of mindfulness-based attitudinal and behavior change, as related to food, eating, and body image. The focus group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify salient concepts. Settings/Location:Focus group discussions were held at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) (United States). Participants:A sample of nine women who were enrolled in the mindful eating program at UMMS for problems with self-reported binge and/or emotional eating participated in this study. Results:Four themes were constructed that described a process of mindfulness-based behavior change, including (1) Learning Through Self-Awareness, (2) Self-Empowerment, (3) Mindful Choice-Making, and (4) Resilient Self-Care. An overarching description of the participants' perceived attitudinal and behavior changes was developed: \"unforced freedom of choice, emerging from embodied awareness.\" Conclusions:These findings suggest that MBIs reduce may disordered eating behaviors through empowering women to make positive choices about food, eating, and coping, without focusing on weight control. Future research is needed to examine whether these findings replicate in larger and more diverse samples, and how they can be used to optimize and implement eating-specific MBIs in community-based settings.",

Behavioral interventions may be beneficial in reducing weight and improving the psychological outcomes of bariatric patients.Objective: The review intended to evaluate the benefits of mindfulness training for weight management among pre- and postoperative, bariatric-surgery patients and to help determine the design of the most effective mindfulness program for them.Design: The research team performed a systematic narrative review by searching the Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases. The search terms included mindfulness-based therapy, stress reduction, relaxation therapy, meditation, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Eligible studies included those using interventions that examined the impact of mindfulness on weight loss for bariatric-surgery patients. Due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, the research team conducted a narrative synthesis rather than a meta-analysis.Setting: The review took place in the Community Health Sciences Department at the College of Applied Medical Sciences of King Saud University in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes included indicators of body-weight change, such as kilograms, pounds, or BMIs. Secondary outcomes included changes: (1) in eating behavior, such as in binge eating, grazing behavior, craving behavior, and emotional eating, (2) in caloric intake, (3) in mental health, including a reduction in anxiety or depression, (4) in quality of life, (5) mindfulness acceptability and practice, (6) in physical activity, and (7) in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).Results: The research team included eight studies in the review. One study aimed to explore the impact of mindfulness on pre-operative patients, and the remaining seven studies measured the impact among postoperative individuals. Most studies suggested that mindfulness-based interventions can have a positive impact on weight outcomes and eating behaviors. The team also found promising effects for mental health outcomes, including anxiety and depression. It's important to note that the included studies reported no strategies that examined treatment fidelity and the monitoring of an intervention's delivery.Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can be useful in tackling eating disorders and in promoting weight loss among bariatric individuals. Further studies are warranted in this area to make explicit recommendations that inform pre- and post-bariatric guidelines.

Thus, the purpose of this pilot study was to examine associations between changes in facets of mindfulness and relationship satisfaction among participants enrolled in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course and their nonenrolled romantic partners. Twenty MBSR participants and their nonenrolled partners (n = 40) completed measures of mindfulness and relationship satisfaction pre- and post-enrolled partners' completion of an MBSR course. Results indicated that enrolled participants significantly improved on all facets of mindfulness and relationship satisfaction, while nonenrolled partners did not significantly increase on any facet of mindfulness or relationship satisfaction. Moreover, enrolled participants' increases in Acting with Awareness were positively associated with increases in their own and their nonenrolled partners' relationship satisfaction, whereas increases in enrolled participants' Nonreactivity were positively associated with increases in their nonenrolled partners' (but not their own) relationship satisfaction. These results suggest that increasing levels of mindfulness (particularly specific aspects of mindfulness) may have positive effects on couples' relationship satisfaction and highlight mindfulness training as a promising tool for education and intervention efforts aimed at promoting relational health.",

The aim of this qualitative study was to explore lived experiences of undergraduates in a mindfulness-based program at a \"college of opportunity \" that has high proportions of first-generation college students. Specifically, we sought to: (1) explore the application of mindfulness practices in students' daily lives; (2) explore how participants believe mindfulness training affected their health and well-being; (3) learn participants' recommendations and suggested changes for mindfulness-based interventions in future iterations. Methods: Students were recruited from XXX and consented to participate in semi-structured digitally conducting interviews after the completion of the 8-week intervention in the Fall/Spring 2020 academic year. Data were analyzed using Applied Thematic Analysis and a codebook was constructed using a consensus-driven process using both a priori and emergent coding. All transcripts were double-coded, and concordance was achieved for all interviews. Results: Qualitative results indicated that the most applied practices were those that could be easily incorporated into a daily routine. Furthermore, students reported an increased ability to cope with a variety of stressors, decreased reactivity, and enhanced resilience specifically concerning mental health challenges. Additionally, engaging in mindfulness training improved students' ability to navigate social distancing measures, other COVID-19-specific stress, and enhanced motivation for self-care practices to sustain well-being. Concerning preferred intervention delivery modality, participants stated that due to multiple, growing responsibilities (e.g., pressures of commuting to class) they preferred in-person delivery, shorter sessions over a longer period, with classes in the morning or early afternoon. Conclusions: Findings provide pragmatic and psychosocial insights into students' application of mindfulness training across personal, professional, and academic domains enhancing their well-being.

            "abstract": "Background: Meditation is associated with lower blood pressure, but little is known about how loving-kindness meditation affects nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, a key mediator of cardiovascular physiology associated with vasodilation.Methods: We studied seven inexperienced and five experienced healthy meditators at one study visit, after they refrained from eating nitrate-rich foods for at least 12 h. Participants completed questionnaires on demographics and meditation practices. We measured nitrite and nitrate and self-reported stress at baseline, after a neutral reading period (prior to meditation), immediately after, and 10 min following a standardized 20-min loving-kindness meditation.Results: The 12 subjects had a mean age of 51 years, and two were male. Stress was significantly lower at baseline in the experienced group (15 vs. 49 on 100 point scale, P < .05) as was heart rate (HR) [68.1 +/- 0.5 beats per minute (bpm) vs. 73.4 +/- 0.7 bpm, P < .05]. Stress levels fell significantly with meditation (52 vs. 11, P < .05), while relaxation increased (55 vs. 89, P < .05) in the inexperienced group. Plasma nitrite levels were not significantly higher, but nitrate levels were more than twice as high (P < .05) for experienced vs. inexperienced meditators before and after loving-kindness meditation.Conclusion: Loving-kindness meditation is associated with stress reduction in inexperienced meditators. Experienced meditators had higher nitrate levels, trended toward having higher nitrite levels, and had significantly lower stress levels than inexperienced meditators. Nitric oxide metabolism may be involved in the cardiovascular effects of persistent meditation practice. Larger longitudinal studies would be fruitful to better understand the mechanisms involved.",

            "abstract": "Like the population at large, health care providers hold implicit racial and ethnic biases that may contribute to health care disparities. Little progress has been made in identifying and implementing effective strategies to address these normal but potentially harmful unconscious cognitive processes. We propose that meditation training designed to increase healthcare providers' mindfulness skills is a promising and potentially sustainable way to address this problem. Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness practice can reduce the provider contribution to healthcare disparities through several mechanisms including: reducing the likelihood that implicit biases will be activated in the mind, increasing providers' awareness of and ability to control responses to implicit biases once activated, increasing self-compassion and compassion toward patients, and reducing internal sources of cognitive load (e.g., stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue). Mindfulness training may also have advantages over current approaches to addressing implicit bias because it focuses on the development of skills through practice, promotes a nonjudgmental approach, can circumvent resistance some providers feel when directly confronted with evidence of racism, and constitutes a holistic approach to promoting providers' well-being. We close with suggestions for how a mindfulness approach can be practically implemented and identify potential challenges and research gaps to be addressed. (C) Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

            "title": "Compassion cultivation training promotes medical student wellness and enhanced clinical care",
            "abstract": "Background: Compassionate health care is associated with positive patient outcomes. Educational interventions for medical students that develop compassion may also increase wellness, decrease burnout, and improve provider-patient relationships. Research on compassion training in medical education is needed to determine how students learn and apply these skills. The authors evaluated an elective course for medical students modeled after the Compassion Cultivation Training course developed by the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education. The elective goals were to strengthen student compassion, kindness, and wellness through compassion training and mindfulness meditation training modeled by a faculty instructor. The research objectives were to understand students' applications and perceptions of this training.Methods: Over three years, 45 students participated in the elective at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. The course administered a pre/post Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills that measured observing, describing, acting with awareness, and accepting without judgment. Qualitative analyses of self-reported experiences were used to assess students' perceptions of compassion training and their application of skills learned through the elective.Results: The mindfulness inventory showed significant improvements in observing (t = 3.62, p = 0.005) and accepting without judgment skills (t = 2.87, p = 0.017) for some elective cohorts. Qualitative data indicated that students across all cohorts found the elective rewarding, and they used mindfulness, meditation, and compassion skills broadly outside the course. Students described how the training helped them address major stressors associated with personal, academic, and clinical responsibilities. Students also reported that the skills strengthened interpersonal interactions, including with patients.Conclusions: These outcomes illuminate students' attitudes toward compassion training and suggest that among receptive students, a brief, student-focused intervention can be enthusiastically received and positively influence students' compassion toward oneself and others. To underscore the importance of interpersonal and cognitive skills such as compassion and mindfulness, faculty should consider purposefully modeling these skills to students. Modeling compassion cultivation and mindfulness skills in the context of patient interactions may address student empathy erosion more directly than stress management training alone. This pilot study shows compassion training could be an attractive, efficient option to address burnout by simultaneously promoting student wellness and enhanced patient interactions.",

Despite the proposal that mindfulness practice could be beneficial for treating persons exposed to traumatic events who go on to develop PTSD and/or correlates of past trauma, there are very few mindfulness-skills programs that directly target trauma survivors. This paper seeks to use existing empirical research and theory to explore the potential and challenges of using mindfulness-based interventions to treat trauma-related problems. Through the lens of the group program, Mindfulness and Compassion: the path to growth after trauma (TMC), we explore the potential of integrating trauma-sensitive mindfulness explicitly with compassion training for trauma survivors. This paper seeks to contribute to development of psychological treatment by the methods of mindfulness and compassion training and how they may be used as a complementary or a stand-alone treatment option in phasebased treatment for complex PTSD.

This bears special importance for teachers, as it affects not only them but also their students. Based on accumulating behavioral and neuroscientific findings, it has been suggested that a key process by which mindfulness meditation enhances self-regulation is the altering of self-awareness. Indeed, accumulated work shows that the underlying networks supporting various types of self-awareness are malleable following meditative practice. However, the field of education has developed independently from the study of the self and its relation to contemplative neuroscience thus far, and to date there is no systematic account linking this accumulating body of knowledge to the field of education or discussing how it might be relevant to teachers.Here we show how incorporating insights from contemplative neuroscience-which are built on the conceptualization and neuroscience of the self-into contemplative pedagogy can inform the field and might even serve as a core underlying mechanism tying together different empirical evidence. This review points to potential neural mechanisms by which mindfulness meditation helps teachers manage stress and promote supportive learning environments, resulting in improved educational outcomes, and thus it has significant implications for educational policy regarding teachers.",

The current study explored mindful parenting practices in a cohort of Indian mothers of children aged 10 years and below that emerged in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19. MethodsIn-depth virtual interviews were conducted with 31 urban Indian mothers to explore their lived experiences of mothering during the global crisis and their engagements with mindful parenting practices. The data were thematically analyzed. Results and DiscussionThe study identified two overarching themes and nine subthemes. The first theme, pandemic-induced stress, included the sub-themes of increased workload, poor support system, lack of time for self, and emotional and physical distress. The second theme of mindful parenting included the sub-themes of awareness as a mother and around the child, acceptance toward self and the child, empathic understanding of self and the child, active engagement with the child, and emotional regulation. Increased workload on all fronts coupled with poor support and a lack of time for self-contributed to exacerbated emotional and physical stress in mothers. They addressed these concerns posed by their lived experiences by engaging in mindful parenting processes in their mothering practices. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mindfulness-based parenting techniques could be explored as possible interventions for mothers to alleviate their distress while drawing attention to larger structural changes and policy-level interventions addressing social issues such as gender inequality and childcare concerns.",

            "abstract": "Among the modern versions of mindfulness, mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) has played the key role in introducing mindfulness practice to the field of psychology and medicine. In fact, the efforts to integrate mindfulness into psychology have resulted in further adaptation of MBSR into more secular and psychological forms as well as the creation of a number of mindfulness measures such as the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills, and the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale. At the same time there is increasing scrutiny of mindfulness that goes beyond the initial positive efficacy studies resulting in several important questions being raised. These range from the absence of an operational definition of mindfulness as well as little evidence for the mechanisms of mindfulness that account for outcome changes for various psychopathology and medical conditions. Questions about the defining characteristics of mindfulness are also being raised such as the lack of differentiation between the features called attention and awareness and the interchangeable use of the two terms in modern descriptions of mindfulness. Such questions resonate with traditional practitioners of Buddhist contemplative psychology for whom attention signifies an every-changing factor of consciousness, while awareness refers to a stable and specific state of consciousness.",

A comprehensive database search for quantitative studies was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Sciences Core Collection; 31 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reviewed studies tended to indicate a pattern of moderately frequent practice (around four days/week), with very high variability in terms of time invested; most studies observed significant associations between the amount of practice and positive health outcomes. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy were the most common interventions and presented low levels of adherence to home practice (39.6% of the recommended time).

Results suggested large effects on stress, moderate effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life, and small effects on burnout. When combined, changes in mindfulness and compassion measures correlated with changes in clinical measures at post-treatment and at follow-up.

Along with the advanced research in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, this study aimed to explore the impact of gut microbiota on the effectiveness and responsiveness to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) among high trait anxiety populations. DesignA standard MBCT was performed among 21 young adults with high trait anxiety. A total of 29 healthy controls were matched for age and sex. The differences in gut microbiota between the two groups were compared. The changes in fecal microbiota and psychological indicators were also investigated before and after the intervention. ResultsCompared with healthy controls, we found markedly decreased bacterial diversity and distinctive clusters among high trait anxiety populations, with significant overgrowth of bacteria such as Streptococcus, Blautia, and Romboutsia, and a decrease in genera such as Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus_3, and Lachnoclostridium. Moreover, MBCT attenuated trait anxiety and depression, improved mindfulness and resilience, and increased the similarity of gut microbiota to that of healthy controls. Notably, a high presence of intestinal Subdoligranulum pre-MBCT was associated with increased responsiveness to MBCT. Decreases in Subdoligranulum post-MBCT were indicative of ameliorated trait anxiety. The tryptophan metabolism pathways were significantly over-represented among high responders compared to low responders. ConclusionThe significantly increased diversity post-MBCT added evidence to gut-brain communication and highlighted the utility of mycobiota-focused strategies for promoting the effectiveness and responsiveness of the MBCT to improve trait anxiety.",

We developed and pilot tested a mindfulness training program and assessed its impact on resident physician burnout and resilience.METHODS: The residency program offered 17 family medicine residents a 10-hour mindfulness training over the course of 2 months in 2016. Residents were encouraged, but not mandated, to attend. Experienced Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction teachers and a family physician/integrative health fellow cotaught the program. A research team qualitatively assessed deidentified, postintervention resident interviews. Residents completed four quantitative questionnaires preintervention, immediately postintervention, and 3 months postintervention. A t score was calculated to assess for statistical significance.RESULTS: Three residents (18%) attended all five training sessions, seven residents (41%) completed at least four sessions, and 16 residents (94%) completed either one or two sessions. Eight residents completed the postintervention interview. Twelve, nine and 14 residents completed the four questionnaires at the three time points, respectively. Qualitative results identified multiple personal/professional benefits of participating in mindfulness training, and we found a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress and increase in mindful awareness from pre- to postintervention (P<.05).CONCLUSIONS: A resident physician mindfulness training program can be reasonably integrated into the residency schedule as part of the wellness curriculum required by the Accrediation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

A new classification of interventions was proposed to enable a more detailed examination of the effectiveness of psychological interventions; 350 postintervention effect sizes in 128 studies and 155 follow-up effect sizes in 55 studies were computed. Postintervention effects were significant for all outcomes when all interventions are pooled together. Follow-up effects were found for all outcomes, except physical health and positive aspects of caregiving. Educational programs with psychotherapeutic components, counseling/psychotherapy, and mindfulness-based interventions had the strongest effects on reducing depressive symptoms. Multicomponent and miscellaneous interventions had the largest effects on reduction of burden/stress. Multicomponent and mindfulness-based interventions had the largest effects on enhancing subjective well-being. It should be noted that mindfulness and counseling/psychotherapy studies generally had small samples, and studies with smaller sample sizes tended to report larger effects. Metaregression analyses revealed that, overall, younger caregivers benefited more from the interventions. Although the majority of studies were from North America and Europe, there were a growing number from Asia and other parts of the world. Recommendations were made, including developing new theoretical models that address caregivers' changing needs over time; development of interventions that can be flexibly administered and individually \"tailored,\" and assessing positive as well as negative aspects of caregiving to encourage development of greater resilience. We conclude with observations on the global health significance of improving the impact of psychosocial interventions on caregivers' lives.",

            "abstract": "Background: Military sexual trauma (MST) is reported by up to 74% of women veterans in the United States and is a driver of poor behavioural and physical health. Self-compassion is a transdiagnostic, protective factor linked with improved posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and health behaviours. Thus, Mindful Self-Compassion training (MSC) may help ameliorate MST-related impacts. However, MSC can also temporarily increase distress (i.e. backdraft). Delivering it with elective trauma-informed yoga (TIY), which regulates acute distress, may help address this issue.Objective: This VA quality improvement project examined feasibility, acceptability, and reported benefits and challenges of a manualized 8-week MSC including within non-randomized subgroups: MSC (n = 4) and MSC+ elective TIY classes (MSC+; n = 4).Methods: Nine women veterans with a history of MST at a Vet Center in the Northeastern U.S.A. enrolled; eight completed, excluding one MSC+ participant. Measures included attrition (n = 9), attendance (n = 8), weekly (n = 8) and posttreatment acceptability (n = 6), validated symptom severity assessments (n = 7), and an exit interview (n = 8).Results: Among completers, MSC attendance was excellent (89%) and higher among in MSC+ vs. MSC (94% vs. 84% sessions completed). On average across the two groups, depressive and PTSD symptom severity decreased by 21% and 30%, respectively. In exit interviews, participants across groups described improved coping with distress and psychiatric symptoms, reduced stress, and improved self-care and health behaviours. Although women in both groups reported backdraft during the programme, MSC+ also reported healthier coping and improved emotional processing.Conclusion: The results of this programme evaluation infer MSC may be feasible, acceptable, and beneficial for women survivors of MST in one Vet Center in the Northeastern USA. Further, temporary elevations in MSC-related distress may be ameliorated with adjunctive TIY. Given requests of women veterans in the USA. for additional complementary and integrative health treatment options, formal research on these approaches is warranted.This programme evaluation with women veterans with a history of military sexual trauma (MST) explored the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and reported benefits and challenges of a Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) programme, with or without trauma-informed yoga.Women across groups reported improved psychiatric symptoms, self-care, and health behaviours, although those in MSC+ yoga reported healthier coping and improved emotional processing.Results suggest MSC training may be feasible, acceptable, and potentially beneficial for women veterans with MST in one clinical setting in the Northeastern USA, with potential synergistic effects of adjunctive yoga.Antecedentes: Hasta el 74% de las mujeres veteranas de los Estados Unidos han sufrido traumas sexuales en el ejercito (MST, en sus siglas en ingles), lo que provoca una mala salud fisica y conductual. La autocompasion es un factor protector transdiagnostico relacionado con la mejora del trastorno de estres postraumatico (TEPT), la depresion y los comportamientos saludables. Asi pues, el entrenamiento en Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC, en sus siglas en ingles) puede ayudar a mejorar los efectos relacionados con el MST. Sin embargo, el MSC tambien puede aumentar temporalmente la perturbacion (es decir, el retroceso). Si se combina con el yoga informada en trauma (TIY, en sus siglas en ingles), que regula la angustia aguda, puede ayudar a resolver este problema.Objetivo: Este proyecto de mejora de la calidad de VA examino la viabilidad, la aceptabilidad y los beneficios y desafios reportados de un MSC manualizado de 8 semanas incluyendo dentro de subgrupos no aleatorizados: MSC (n = 4) y MSC+ clases selectivas de TIY (MSC+; n = 4).Metodos: Se inscribieron nueve mujeres veteranas con antecedentes de MST en un centro de veteranos del noreste de EE.UU.; ocho completaron el programa, excluida una participante MSC+. Las medidas incluyeron desercion (n = 9), asistencia (n = 8), aceptabilidad semanal (n = 8) y posterior al tratamiento (n = 6), evaluaciones validadas de la gravedad de los sintomas (n = 7) y una entrevista de salida (n = 8).Resultados: Entre los participantes, la asistencia al MSC fue excelente (89%) y mayor en el MSC+ que en el MSC (94% frente a 84% de sesiones completadas). En promedio, en los dos grupos, la gravedad de los sintomas depresivos y de TEPT disminuyo un 21% y un 30%, respectivamente. En las entrevistas de salida, las participantes de todos los grupos describieron una mejora en el afrontamiento de la perturbacion y los sintomas psiquiatricos, una reduccion del estres y una mejora en las conductas de autocuidado y salud. Aunque las mujeres de ambos grupos informaron de un retroceso durante el programa, MSC+ tambien informo de un afrontamiento mas saludable y una mejora en el procesamiento emocional.Conclusiones: Los resultados de esta evaluacion del programa infieren que el MSC puede ser factible, aceptable y beneficioso para las mujeres sobrevivientes de MST en un Centro de Veteranos en el noreste de EE.UU. Ademas, las elevaciones temporales en la angustia relacionada con el MSC pueden mejorarse con TIY complementario. Dadas las necesidades de las mujeres veteranas en EE.UU. de opciones adicionales de tratamiento complementario e integrador de la salud, se justifica la investigacion formal de estos enfoques.",

            "abstract": "Background: Vicarious exposure to trauma is ubiquitous in palliative medicine. Repeated exposure to trauma may contribute to compassion fatigue and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in medical and supportive care professionals such as physicians, nurses, and social workers. These symptoms may be intensified among medical and supportive care professionals who use avoidant or rigid coping strategies.Aim: This study aimed to provide an estimate of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in a sample of professionals who work in palliative care settings, and have already been enrolled in mindfulness-based communication training.Design: Palliative care providers provided self-reported ratings of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression, and coping strategies using validated measures including the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version.Setting/participants: A total of 21 professionals working with palliative care patients completed assessments prior to beginning mindfulness-based communication training.Results: Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were prevalent in this sample of professionals; 42% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and 33% indicated probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis.Conclusion: Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms may be common among professionals working in palliative medicine. Professionals prone to avoidant coping and those with more rigid negative thought processes may be at higher risk for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.",

            "abstract": "Sleep disturbance is frequently reported by women during the menopausal transition due to various physiological changes and environmental factors. Insomnia is a critical treatment target for its deleterious effects on daytime functioning and quality of life and increased risk of developing a depressive disorder. Due to medication side effects and patient preferences, there is increased interest in the use of psychological treatments that address the myriad of menopausal symptoms, including cognitive-behavioural therapy, clinical hypnosis and mindfulness-based therapies. The objective of this article is to review the effects of psychological treatments for menopausal symptoms on sleep disturbance in peri-/postmenopausal women. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed and reference lists from inception until May 2023, including 12 studies that evaluated sleep as a secondary outcome. Most studies found that group and self-help (guided and unguided) cognitive-behavioural therapies and clinical hypnosis for menopausal symptoms have positive effects on sleep among women with significant vasomotor symptoms. There was preliminary support for mindfulness-based stress reduction. Future research including more diverse samples and women with sleep disorders is needed. Evaluating the implementation of psychological therapies in clinics where menopausal women seek care is an important next step.",

The present systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence about the positive psychology interventions utilized in breast cancer.MethodsRelevant studies were identified via Pubmed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL, Wiley Online Library, TDX, and DIALNET databases (up to April 2013). Only those papers focused on interventions related to positive psychology and carried out on breast cancer patients were included.ResultsOf the 7266 articles found through databases, 16 studies were finally included in this review. Five groups of therapies were found: mindfulness-based approaches, expression of positive emotions, spiritual interventions, hope therapy, and meaning-making interventions. These specific interventions promoted positive changes in breast cancer participants, such as enhanced quality of life, well-being, hope, benefit finding, or optimism. However, the disparity of the interventions and some methodological issues limit the outcomes.ConclusionsSome studies provided relevant evidence about the clear development of positive aspects from the breast cancer experience. Positive interventions applied to patients and survivors of breast cancer were found to be able to promote positive aspects. A global consensus of a positive therapies classification is needed to take one more step in structuring positive psychology. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Method: Secondary analyses were performed with a combined data set consisting of 2 published and 2 unpublished trials of MBSR conducted at a large Veterans Affairs hospital. The combined sample included 113 veterans enrolled in MBSR who screened positive for PTSD and completed measures of mindfulness and PTSD symptoms before and after the 8-week intervention. Results: Increases in mindfulness were significantly associated with reduced PTSD symptoms. Increases in Acting With Awareness and Non-Reactivity were the facets of mindfulness most strongly and consistently associated with reduced PTSD symptoms. Increases in mindfulness were most strongly related to decreases in Hyperarousal and Emotional Numbing. Conclusions: These results extend previous research, provide preliminary support for changes in mindfulness as a viable mechanism of treatment, and have a number of potential practical and theoretical implications.

The objective of this pilot study was to obtain information on the feasibility and effect of participation in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on HF severity and menopause-related quality of life.Design: Fifteen women volunteers reporting a minimum of seven moderate to severe HFs per day at study intake attended the eight weekly MBSR classes at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Participants were assessed for menopause-related quality of life before beginning and at the conclusion of the MBSR program. Women also kept a daily log of their HFs through the course of the 7 weeks of the MBSR program and for 4 weeks after it.Results: Women's scores on quality-of-life measures increased significantly, and the median reported HF severity, calculated as the weekly average of a daily HF severity score, decreased 40% over the course of the 11 weeks of the assessment period. The women were individually interviewed at the completion of their participation, and the results of the interviews were consistent with the results from daily diaries.Conclusions: These results provide preliminary positive evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of MBSR in supporting women who are experiencing severe HFs, and it warrants further investigation.",

The majority of participants were female, married, and had breast cancer.Main results Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that participants in both groups improved significantly over time on overall post-traumatic growth (p=0.015). Participants in the MBSR group improved on measures of spirituality more than those in the HA group (p=0.029).

The aim of the present review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of MBIs including those with mindfulness as an active treatment component for alleviating symptoms of psychosis to inform future clinical practice. Methods A systematic review of studies published in journals or in dissertations in CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, ISRCTN, or CNKI from January 1990 until December 2020. A total of 31 eligible studies (n = 2146) were included. Results Effect-size estimates suggested that 22 independent samples (n = 1632) produced a statistically significant small effect for psychotic symptoms (g = -0.48), and with a clinically significant reduction of 50% from baseline (pooled OR: 1.84). Separate meta-analyses demonstrated small effects for affective symptoms (g = -0.44) and small-to-large positive effects for quality of life (g = 0.38), mindfulness skills (g = 0.45), and insight into illness/treatment (g = 1.35). The heterogeneity was high across the studies. Conclusion Results suggest that short-term MBIs can be beneficial for non-affective psychosis.

KEY MESSAGES Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, also known as non-affective psychosis, is the most chronic and debilitating type of psychosis, seriously affecting every aspect of a person's life, including social, occupational, or general functioning. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate formerly unexamined questions regarding the clinical significance of MBIs including yoga as an increasingly utilized, conceptualized psychological intervention on overall psychotic symptoms for people with non-affective psychosis. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies, suggesting that MBIs may be safe interventions, while there is robust evidence to support the view that MBIs are beneficial to young people in particular.",

Design/methodology/approach A narrative literature review was performed in the technostress, job demands-resources and mindfulness literature to develop the propositions of the integrative conceptual model. Findings This paper posits psychological need satisfaction as a mediator in the process by which technostressors impact important employee outcomes. It also proposes mindfulness as a personal resource that helps alleviate technostressor induced burnout and foster work engagement. Research limitations/implications The proposed integrative conceptual framework provides some useful directions for future empirical research on this topic of growing importance. Practical implications Based on the findings of this paper, managers can devise and implement a technostressor-specific mitigation strategy to cope with information and communication technology-induced work demands. They can also introduce mindfulness-based programs to support positive outcomes when technostressors are present.

It aimed at documenting sustained mindfulness practice, perceived long-term benefit from the program, and changes regarded as direct consequences of the intervention.Design: This cross-sectional survey took place at least 2 years after MBCT for 70.4% of participants.Location: It was conducted in two specialized outpatient units for BDs that are part of the Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland) and the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris (France).Subjects: Eligibility criteria were a diagnosis of BD according to DSM-IV and participation in at least four MBCT sessions. Response rate was 66.4%. The final sample included 71 outpatients (71.8% bipolar I, 28.2% bipolar II).Outcome measures: A questionnaire retrospectively assessed patient-perceived change, benefit from MBCT, and current mindfulness practice.Results: Proportions of respondents who practiced mindfulness at least once a week were 54.9% for formal practice (body scan, sitting meditation, mindful walking, or movements) and 57.7% for informal practice (mindful daily activities). Perceived benefit for the prevention of relapse was moderate, but patients acknowledged long-lasting effects and persistent changes in their way of life. Formal mindfulness practice at least once a week tended to be associated with increased long-lasting effects (p=0.052), whereas regular informal practice and mindful breathing were significantly associated with persistent changes in daily life (p=0.038) and better prevention of depressive relapse (p=0.035), respectively. The most frequently reported positive change was increased awareness of being able to improve one's health.Conclusions: Despite methodological limitations, this survey allowed documenting mindfulness practice and perceived sustained benefit from MBCT in patients with BD. Participants particularly valued increased awareness that they can influence their own health. Both informal and formal practices, when sustained in the long term, might promote long-lasting changes.",

Given that a mother's ability to successfully cope with the demands of her caregiving role may be predictive of positive familial psychosocial outcomes, it is critical that maternal coping is assessed and supported in paediatric healthcare. Mindfulness-based programmes are proposed as one intervention that may enhance quality of life, improve distress tolerance and coping and reduce social isolation in caregiving populations. This pilot study aims to investigate: (1) the implementation success of a mindfulness-based retreat (MBR), and (2) the effectiveness of a MBR at improving quality of life, distress tolerance, coping and perceived social support for mothers of paediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods and analysis A convergent parallel, mixed-method design is proposed for this pilot, exploratory study. Twenty mothers will participate in this pilot MBR held at a resort in Ontario, Canada. Quantitative data will be obtained using five standardised instruments completed at three time points: (T1) 24-hours prior to the intervention, (T2) immediately on completion of the intervention, and (T3) three months post-intervention. Qualitative data will be collected from all participants both through semi-structured focus groups at T2 and individual telephone interviews at T3. Focus groups and individual interviews will be transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data will be merged and compared during interpretation to ensure that the intervention implementation and effectiveness of the MBR retreat are described with comprehensive accuracy. The primary outcomes will be feasibility in relation to implementation effectiveness and participants' perception of social support for efficacy of the MBR intervention.

Access to specialist psychological support is limited. This study aimed to support a new service development project, in collaboration with Kidney Care UK, to implement the Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme, developed by MindfulnessUK, which provides accessible mindfulness techniques and practices to enhance compassion and resilience, and explore its feasibility for people living with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease and transplant. Methods A multi-method feasibility design was utilised. Participants over 18 years, from the UK, with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease or post-transplant, and who were not currently undergoing psychotherapy, were recruited to the four-week CMR programme. Data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and three-months post to measure anxiety, depression, self-compassion, mental wellbeing, resilience, and mindfulness.

            "abstract": "Question Mindfulness-based programmes (MBPs) are an increasingly popular approach to improving mental health in young people. Our previous meta-analysis suggested that MBPs show promising effectiveness, but highlighted a lack of high-quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This updated meta-analysis assesses the-state-of the-art of MBPs for young people in light of new studies. It explores MBP's effectiveness in active vs passive controls; selective versus universal interventions; and studies that included follow-up. Study selection and analysis We searched for published and unpublished RCTs of MBPs with young people (<19 years) in PubMed Central, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, EThOS, EBSCO and Google Scholar. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, and standardised mean differences (Cohen's d) were calculated. Findings Sixty-six RCTs, involving 20 138 participants (9552 receiving an MBP and 10 586 controls), were identified. Compared with passive controls, MBPs were effective in improving anxiety/stress, attention, executive functioning, and negative and social behaviour (d from 0.12 to 0.35). Compared against active controls, MBPs were more effective in reducing anxiety/stress and improving mindfulness (d=0.11 and 0.24, respectively). In studies with a follow-up, there were no significant positive effects of MBPs. No consistent pattern favoured MBPs as a universal versus selective intervention. Conclusions The enthusiasm for MBPs in youth has arguably run ahead of the evidence. While MBPs show promising results for some outcomes, in general, the evidence is of low quality and inconclusive. We discuss a conceptual model and the theory-driven innovation required to realise the potential of MBPs in supporting youth mental health.",

Methods: This systematic review focused on synthesizing qualitative data and was registered with PROSPERO under the protocol registration number xxx. Searched 7 databases for qualitative studies on MBIs & cancer patients (17 studies, 365 patients). Analyzed data using themes & assessed confidence in findings. Results: Thematic analysis using NVivo software revealed four significant themes: (1) benefits and positive outcomes (e.g., symptom improvement, team support, positive experiences), (2) challenges and difficulties (e.g., practice challenges, negative experiences), (3) the journey of change and acceptance (e.g., shifts in perception, personal growth, and acceptance), and (4) adaptations and recommendations (e.g., program modification and flexibility). Conclusion: Mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to offer cancer patients positive emotional experiences, increased team support, and opportunities for personal growth, self-discovery, and acceptance. This, in turn, can help them manage the psychological distress associated with cancer. Customizing programs to align with individual patients' needs and preferences can enhance engagement and effectiveness. Practice implications: Integrating MBIs into Patient Education and Counseling, tailored to individual needs and with ongoing support, can enhance cancer care. Group interventions foster peer support and effectiveness. Training providers and ensuring accessibility are crucial. Research and customization to patients' journeys optimize outcomes and satisfaction. A patient-centered approach is essential for positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes.",

Whilst the field of mindfulness during the perinatal period is in need of well controlled trials and studies exploring the mechanisms of action (Hall et al., 2016) the limited research to date supports the potential for mindfulness based interventions in pregnancy and the need for further scientific study in this area (Dhillon et al., 2017; Shi and Macbeth, 2017). Particularly because it may broaden women's repertoire of coping strategies with the potential to improve the developmental trajectory of both parents and infants (Dunn et al., 2012; Duncan and Bardacke, 2010; Vieten and Astin, 2008). However, most of the studies to date have involved lengthy courses of around 8-9 weeks (24 h) duration, which may not be feasible or economical within a UK NHS setting and therefore, would be unlikely to be adopted as routine practice.Design: An initial pilot study to discover if MBCP-4-NHS is acceptable and feasible within NHS maternity services, comparing maternal and paternal pre and post intervention self-report measures of mental health to begin to explore the effectiveness of this intervention.Setting: NHS antenatal education classes held in children's centres for expectant parents across Oxfordshire.Participants: All expectant parents receiving Oxfordshire maternity services between October 2014 and January 2015 were invited to self-refer into the intervention, of which 155 individuals (86 women and 69 men) took part.Intervention: 'MBCP-4-NHS' - A brief (four week, ten hour) course developed from the nine week Mindfulness Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) intervention.Measures: Self-report measures of mental health including low mood/depression, mindfulness, stress, anxiety, pregnancy related distress and experiences.Findings: The results showed a significant increase in both maternal and paternal mental health with women demonstrating a significant improvement in symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, pregnancy-related distress, labour worry and positive and negative pregnancy experiences; and men improving significantly in symptoms of anxiety, depression and showing a trend for improvement in self-reported symptoms of perceived stress.Conclusions: This is a promising antenatal intervention that can be feasibly implemented within NHS which might have the potential to impact upon parental mental health and, therefore, possibly also the health of next generation. However, caution is needed interpreting these findings given that this study did not include an active control group.",

This systematic review evaluated the efficacy of positive psychological intervention (PPI) in neurological populations. Methods: Previous studies relevant to this topic were identified by searches in PUBMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PSYCINFO databases from Jan 1980 to August 2017. Results: Of 1361 articles identified, 31 studies were included. Nineteen studies were randomized controlled trials. Sixteen studies had sample sizes of less than 30. Twelve studies were rated as high quality using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) quality assessment tools. Six therapies were found: mindfulness-based approaches, positive savoring, life summary, expressive-based, hope-based interventions, and character strengths. These interventions were shown to improve quality of life, reduce symptomatic distress, and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: PPIs promote well-being among patients with neurological deficits. For PPIs to be considered as an evidence-based practice, more trials with adequate statistical power are required.",

            "abstract": "The well-being of health care providers may be challenged by their work, with evidence that oncology health care providers are a high-risk group for burnout. The present qualitative pilot study evaluated a mindfulness-based group intervention, referred to as Compassion, Presence, and Resilience Training (CPR-T), for oncology interprofessional teams. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the subjective experience of oncology health care providers receiving CPR-T and their perceptions of its benefits, risks, or challenges. The CPR-T was delivered to providers from two oncology teams in a large cancer center in Canada. Ten of these providers participated in semistructured interviews 1 to 5 months after completing the CPR-T. The interview transcripts were coded using a thematic analysis strategy. Five benefits of the CPR-T were identified: learning to pause, acquiring a working definition of stress and self-care, becoming fully present, building self-compassion, and receiving organizational acknowledgment and recognition of stress. In addition, two participant-identified challenges were recognized: sharing vulnerability within interprofessional teams and committing to a sitting meditation practice. These findings demonstrate positive transformations as a result of the CPR-T, as well as important challenges, and have important implications for holistic health care practice in oncology. Further research is necessary to validate the findings of this explorative study.",

            "abstract": "Background: The investigation of treatment mechanisms in randomized controlled trials has considerable clinical and theoretical relevance. Despite the empirical support for the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), the specific mechanisms by which MBCT leads to therapeutic change remain unclear.Objective: By means of a systematic review we evaluate how the field is progressing in its empirical investigation of mechanisms of change in MBCT for recurrent MDD.Method: To identify relevant studies, a systematic search was conducted. Studies were coded and ranked for quality.Results: The search produced 476 articles, of which 23 were included. In line with the theoretical premise, 12 studies found that alterations in mindfulness, rumination, worry, compassion, or meta-awareness were associated with, predicted or mediated MBCT's effect on treatment outcome. In addition, preliminary studies indicated that alterations in attention, memory specificity, self-discrepancy, emotional reactivity and momentary positive and negative affect might play a role in how MBCT exerts its clinical effects.Conclusion: The results suggest that MBCT could work through some of the MBCT model's theoretically predicted mechanisms. However, there is a need for more rigorous designs that can assess greater levels of causal specificity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

This article reviews the impact of MBSR for people with chronic diseases. The review includes original research that was published in English and peer-reviewed and reported outcomes for adults with chronic diseases who had participated in an MBSR program. Fifteen studies were identified. Outcomes related to mental and physical health, well-being, and quality of life The studies included different research designs, and used self-report and physiological outcome measures Participants' clinical diagnoses included fibromyalgia, chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, and cardiovascular diagnoses. All 15 studies found that participation in an MBSR program resulted in improvements. No negative change was reported between baseline and follow up Outcomes in regard to specific variables were difficult to compare and equivocal Overall, positive change predominated. Chronic diseases are associated with a range of unwelcome psychological and physical consequences. Participation in an MBSR program is likely to result in coping better with symptoms, improved overall well-being and quality of life, and enhanced health outcomes. As an adjunct to standard care, M BSI has potential for much wider application in Australian primary care settings.",

The results are then integrated with the results of seven other studies testing the effects of brief LKM on prosocial behavior using a meta-analysis (n = 683).FindingsLKM increased love more than the control group (focused breathing) in the three experiments; however, its effects on donations were mixed. The meta-analysis shows that LKM has a small-to-medium significant effect compared to active control groups (d = 0.303); moreover, age and type of prosocial measure used moderate the effects.Originality/valueResults suggest that LKM can nurture prosocial emotions such as love and lead young individuals to donate. However, these emotions may not be sufficient to lead adult meditators to share their resources with unknown others. This study presents the first meta-analysis of brief LKM and provides insights into the use of meditation in social marketing programs.",

Most studies (14) were cross-sectional, three were longitudinal, and three others used mindfulness-based or endurance-enhancing physical activity interventions. Their results revealed increased resilience even after short-duration and low-frequency interventions. Cross-sectional research results also support the positive relationship between physical activity and resilience in older adults, suggesting that the relationship might depend on exercise volume. Still, further research is needed to design interventions, understand the mechanism(s) involved in altering resilience, and maximize physical activity's benefits in aging people.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness, as the word is commonly used in contemporary meditation teaching, refers to both being aware of our present moment's experience, and relating to that experience without grasping, aversion or delusion. All three habitual tendencies distort our perception of what is happening, and lead us to futile and misguided efforts to deny or control our experience. Loving-kindness is a quality of the heart that recognizes how connected we all are. Loving-kindness is essentially a form of inclusiveness of caring, rather than categorizing others in terms of those whom we care for and those who can be easily excluded, ignored or disdained. Any reduction in our tendency to fall into attachment, aversion or delusion helps refine and expand the force of loving-kindness. A deepening of insight will inevitably include seeing how all of our lives are inextricably interconnected. The diminishing of grasping, aversion and delusion and the increase in insight are both reasons mindfulness naturally leads us to greater loving-kindness.",

To participate, AA women had to meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or have a history of exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV) as determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ). This article also presents the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of AWARE from its Stage I pilot study of nine Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese American women. To foster holistic treatment, AWARE was developed based on original research findings from Stage 0 and integrated theoretical models including fractured identity theory, empowerment theory, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based techniques, and the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM). The development of AWARE was an iterative process informed by participant feedback, which led to frequent intervention modifications for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Stage II. A qualitative analysis of participant feedback informed the following modifications: further exploration of feelings, improvements in technology delivery, learning and practicing coping skills, more specific cultural tailoring related to sexual health, decreased number of sessions and increased time per session. Findings provide support for the acceptability and feasibility of AWARE as culturally informed for AA young women with IPV histories, high-risk behaviors, and mental health issues.",

Mind-body therapies (MBTs), such as tai-chi/qigong (TCQ) or mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), have shown promise in decreasing negative psychosocial outcomes in cancer survivors, but few studies have explored potential differences in MBT use and effectiveness across age groups.Methods: A descriptive phenomenological qualitative design was used. Participants included young (18-39), middle (40-64), and older (65+) adult cancer survivors who were diagnosed with any type of cancer and had participated in Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) or Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ) MBTs. Semi-structured qualitative interviews explored participants' experiences in MBTs and these were analyzed using descriptive phenomenological analysis.Results: Among the interviews (n = 18), young (n = 6), middle-aged (n = 8), and older (n = 4) adults participated. 5 themes emerged: influences in joining the program, unique lifestyles, positive class experiences, use of media, and program impacts. Though all age groups benefitted from MBT participation, variations between age groups with respect to the benefits received and motivations for joining the program were observed.Discussion: MBTs had beneficial physical and mental health effects on survivors of all age groups. These benefits were particularly connected to the ongoing life stresses common to each age cohort, such as relief from work and family roles for young adults or support during retirement transition for older adults. Hence, access to MBT programs may be beneficial as part of the survivorship plan for patients and the recruitment strategies or content can be adapted by MBT providers to better target and support age-specific groups. More research is required with a larger sample.",

            "abstract": "The majority of women veterans experience chronic pain and many have comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To enhance resilience in these veterans in terms of both physical functioning and psychosocial well-being, a mindfulness-based, trauma-informed, eight-session group pilot program was designed to target emotion regulation and social belonging. Women who engaged in treatment were asked to complete questionnaires assessing pain, functioning, and affective and social well-being before and after the program. The present retrospective research study evaluated (a) whether women who engaged in treatment showed pre-to-post treatment improvement in psychosocial and physical functioning and (b) whether women referred to the program who engaged versus did not engage in treatment differed in demographic and clinical data (i.e., pain diagnoses, mental health diagnoses, documented trauma history) obtained from medical record review. The sample consisted of 36 women who began the program and filled out a pregroup questionnaire (intent-to-treat sample; ITT) and 105 women who were referred but did not engage in treatment. The majority had a documented history of trauma, a mood disorder, and a PTSD diagnosis. ITT analyses indicated that veterans showed moderate-to-large pre-post improvements in pain severity, pain catastrophizing, physical functioning, depression, self-compassion, and positive affect. Veterans who engaged in treatment were similar to those who did not in demographics, number of pain diagnoses, and mental health diagnoses, but were more likely to have a documented history of trauma. Despite the limitations of this study, the findings are encouraging and point to the value of a future randomized controlled trial.Impact StatementWomen veterans with chronic pain who participated in a trauma-informed, mindfulness-based training tailored to address their prevalent comorbid trauma, mood disturbance, and social isolation showed substantial improvements in physical and emotional health and credited the program with increasing their pain management options. Tailoring treatment to target the unique challenges faced by women veterans with chronic pain may hold promise for enhancing their resilience and quality of life.",

A self-reported questionnaire was developed by the authors and sent via mail to all child and adolescent psychiatrists in Thailand. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used for categorical data and continuous data, respectively, to compare the variables between graduates from four training centers. Only data from respondents who graduated within the past 10 years were analyzed.Results: Of 95 respondents (54.0% response rate), 60 respondents finished child and adolescent psychiatry training within the past 10 years. Their average age was 33.6 +/- 3.6 years. Forty-nine (81.7%) of the respondents were female. Duration of child and adolescent psychiatry practice was 3.6 +/- 2.4 years. Twenty-one (35.0%), 19 (31.7%), 18 (30.0%), and two (3.3%) respondents graduated from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, and Yuwaprasart Waithayopathum Hospital, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the frequency of performing Satir Transformational Systemic Therapy [STST) and positive psychology by respondents who graduated from different training centers (p<0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Additionally, there were statistically significant differences in the levels of confidence in performing CBT, STST, Buddhist psychology, Mindfulness -based psychotherapy, and family therapy. Most respondents perceived that psychotherapy training received during residency was inadequate (86.7%), primarily due to inadequate training continuity (70.7%) and inconsistent supervision (65.5%).Conclusion: Psychotherapy training during residency had an important role in influencing the types of psychotherapy practiced post-graduation. The training experiences also had a significant bearing on future confidence in performing psychotherapy.",

Descriptive analysis, bivariate correlation, and a series of regression equations were conducted to analyze the data. The results indicate that teacher mindfulness, work engagement, and classroom emotions are all at the intermediate level, and significantly correlated. The effect of teacher mindfulness on classroom emotions is partially mediated by work engagement. In addition, negative emotions partially mediate the effect of teacher mindfulness on work engagement, while positive emotions fully mediate it.

Coercive measures are controversial and can lead to negative consequences, including negative emotions, retraumatization, injuries, or death. The article summarizes the last 10 years of literature regarding methods and strategies used for reducing seclusions and restraints in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units, and reports on their outcomes. The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed and PsycInfo for English-language articles published between May 2010 and May 2020. Eighteen articles were found that described methods or strategies aimed at reducing restraint or seclusion utilization in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units. The following interventions were evaluated: Trauma-Informed Care (TIC), Six Core Strategies, Child and Family Centered Care (CFCC), Collaborative & Proactive Solutions (CPS), Strength-Based Care, Modified Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (M-PBIS), Behavioral Modification Program (BMP), Autism Spectrum Disorder Care Pathway (ASD-CP), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), sensory rooms, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training (MBSR) of staff, and Milieu Nurse-Client Shift Assignments. Most of the interventions reduced the use of seclusions and/or restraints. Two child-centered and trauma-informed initiatives eliminated the use of mechanical restraints. This review shows that the use of coercive measures can be reduced and should be prioritized. Successful implementation requires ongoing commitment on all levels of an organization and a willingness to learn. To facilitate comparisons, future models should evaluate different standardized parameters.",

Following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses 2020 guidelines, data were obtained from the databases of Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science in May 2022. Twenty-five studies were included. Globally, 35 biomarkers were employed in these studies and were categorized 8 groups (cortisol; blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and respiratory rate; C-reactive protein; telomere length and telomerase activity (TA); genetic signature; cytokines and hormones; leucocyte activation; leucocyte count and cell subpopulation analysis). In seven of these categories of biomarkers, positive effects of MBIs were observed. The most promising results were obtained for cortisol, BP, TA and pro-inflammatory gene expression. However, the generally low number of studies per single biomarker limits the possibility to draw reliable conclusions.

A relatively wide range of therapeutic models have been adopted with people with PD, from common therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, to less frequent approaches, for example, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and psychodrama. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed, and suggestions are provided for future research on intervention studies and key psychological outcomes.Conclusions CBT appears to be effective in treating depression and sleep disorders in people with PD, while psychoeducation programmes alone should be avoided. The use of CBT to improve anxiety, quality of life, and impulse control, as well mindfulness-based interventions, should be undertaken with some caution because of insufficient research and inconsistent results. As we enter the new decade, more high-quality evidence is required for psychological interventions in people with PD in general and to corroborate preliminary positive findings on the adoption of less frequent approaches such as ACT.Practitioner pointsParkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with several psychological difficulties which be targeted by psychological interventions.Currently, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be recommended to treat depression and sleep disorders in people with Parkinson's, while psychoeducation alone should be avoided.Caution is advised regarding the use of CBT and mindfulness-based interventions to improve anxiety, quality of life, and impulse control.Further evidence is required for less common approaches, such as acceptance and commitment therapy, psychodrama, and EMDR.",

These articles reported the effect of adversity, protecting factors, and/or resilience-promoting interventions to possess resilience after adversity in a global context without a population age limitation. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews. A weighted inverse-variance random-effects model was applied to find the pooled estimates. The subgroup analysis, heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis were also assessed.Results: A total of 44 articles (n = 556,920 participants) were included in this umbrella review. From the random-effects model analysis, the pooled effect of adversity on the development of resilience was 0.25 (p < 0.001). The pooled effects of adversity-protective factors and resilience-promoting interventions after adversity were 0.31 (p < 0.001) and 0.42 (p < 0.001), respectively. The pooled effects of specific adversity protective factors were 0.26, 0.09, 0.05, 0.34, 0.23, and 0.43 for the availability of support, cognitive ability, community cohesion, positive self-perception, religious involvement, and self-regulation, respectively. The pooled effects of specific resilience-promoting interventions were 0.30, 0.21, 0.51, and 0.52 for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, mixed interventions, and resilience-promoting interventions, respectively.Conclusion: The findings of this umbrella review revealed that people who experienced early adversity can develop resilience later in life. The study highlights the need to consider adversity protective factors, such as availability of support (family, friends, and school), cognitive ability, community cohesion, positive self-perception, religious involvement, and self-regulation, and resilience-promoting interventions, including CBT interventions, mindfulness-based interventions, and mixed interventions, to enhance resilience promotion programs.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundFollowing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), up to 40% of patients report elevated depressive symptoms which is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality risk due to behavioral and biological mechanisms. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) delivered via synchronous group videoconferencing could help reduce depressive symptoms.ObjectiveTo guide MBCT adaptation for ACS patients for a future clinical trial, this qualitative study aimed to explore ACS patients' (1) symptoms after ACS, (2) needs for behavioral health treatment, (3) perspectives on mindfulness intervention and group videoconference delivery, and (4) willingness to self-collect dried blood spots in a research study.MethodsWe compared ACS patients with and without depressive symptoms to highlight particularly relevant treatment topics for patients developing depression following ACS experience. From 2/2019-11/2019, we conducted semi-structured individual telephone interviews with N = 23 patients after ACS (N = 13 with and N = 10 without elevated depressive symptoms; 63.4 (SD = 8.5) years, 87% male, 96% non-Hispanic white, 7.1 (SD = 7.5) years since ACS). In qualitative content analyses, four independent coders coded each interview.ResultsParticipants with depressive symptoms experienced emotional, physical, social, and health behavior problems, while those without depressive symptoms made positive health behavior changes and struggled with anxiety symptoms. Both groups were interested in a behavioral health treatment for emotional and social support. Most were willing to participate in a mindfulness group via videoconferencing; some preferred in-person, but accessibility and convenience outweighed these cons. Almost all were willing to self-collect dried blood spots and some were already familiar with this technique.ConclusionACS patients, especially those with depressive symptoms, need help managing a multitude of quality of life concerns that can be targeted with an adapted MBCT approach. A videoconference-delivered MBCT approach is of interest. Suggestions for adapting MBCT to target the needs of ACS patients are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Burnout is a common syndrome seen in healthcare workers, particularly physicians who are exposed to a high level of stress at work; it includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Burnout among physicians has garnered significant attention because of the negative impact it renders on patient care and medical personnel. Physicians who had high burnout levels reportedly committed more medical errors. Stress management programs that range from relaxation to cognitive-behavioral and patient-centered therapy have been found to be of utmost significance when it comes to preventing and treating burnout. However, evidence is insufficient to support that stress management programs can help reducing job-related stress beyond the intervention period, and similarly mindfulness-based stress reduction interventions efficiently reduce psychological distress and negative vibes, and encourage empathy while significantly enhancing physicians' quality of life. On the other hand, a few small studies have suggested that Balint sessions can have a promising positive effect in preventing burnout; moreover exercises can reduce anxiety levels and exhaustion symptoms while improving the mental and physical well-being of healthcare workers. Occupational interventions in the work settings can also improve the emotional and work-induced exhaustion. Combining both individual and organizational interventions can have a good impact in reducing burnout scores among physicians; therefore, multidisciplinary actions that include changes in the work environmental factors along with stress management programs that teach people how to cope better with stressful events showed promising solutions to manage burnout. However, until now there have been no rigorous studies to prove this. More interventional research targeting medical students, residents, and practicing physicians are needed in order to improve psychological well-being, professional careers, as well as the quality of care provided to patients.",

Because the brain is the master regulator of these systems, as well as of behavior, alterations in brain function by chronic stress can have direct and indirect effects on cumulative allostatic overload, which refers to the cost of adaptation. There is much new knowledge on the neural control of systemic physiology and the feedback actions of physiologic mediators on brain regions regulating higher cognitive function, emotional regulation, and self-regulation. The healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience, based upon its ability to respond to interventions designed to open \"windows of plasticity\" and redirect its function toward better health. As a result, plasticity-facilitating treatments should be given within the framework of a positive behavioral intervention; negative experiences during this window may even make matters worse. Indeed, there are no magic bullets and drugs cannot substitute for targeted interventions that help an individual become resilient, of which mindfulness-based stress reduction and meditation are emerging as useful tools.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the psychological outcomes of a mindfulness-based Internet-streamed yoga video in breast cancer survivors. A one-group, repeated-measures, purposive sample using a directed qualitative descriptive and convergent mixed-methods approach was used. Participants were recruited from breast oncology practices across 2 settings in the northeastern United States in April 2019. Education about the video was provided, and the link to the video was sent to participants. Demographic information, Knowing Participation in Change Short Form (KPCSF), Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), and the Generalized Anxiety Distress Scale (GAD-7) were obtained at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks. A semistructured interview was conducted at 4 weeks. Thirty-five women (mean age = 56 years) participated. A one-group, repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated statistically significant changes occurred in all measures between week 0 and week 4: decreased GAD (t = -2.97, P = .004), improved WEMWBS (t = 2.52, P = .008), and increased KPC (t = 2.99, P = .004). Qualitative findings suggest the overall experience of the video was positive and the women would recommend its use to others. Improvements in all psychological measures were achieved with video use. Findings indicate an improvement in psychological measures and support the theory of Knowing Participation in Change. This work further contributes to accessible, flexible interventions available through the Internet and/or mobile applications aimed at improving breast cancer survivorship.",

We aimed to study the potential effect and feasibility of two Internet-based self-help programmes, one mindfulness based (iMBI) and the other music based in a randomised controlled trial that targeted adolescents. A total of 283 upper secondary school students in two Swedish schools were randomised to either a waiting list or one of the two programmes, on their own incentive, on schooltime. General psychiatric health (Symptoms Checklist 90), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were assessed before and after the interventions. In total, 202 participants answered the questionnaires. Less than 20 logged into each intervention and only 1 performed a full intervention (iMBI). No significant differences in any of the scales were found between those who logged in and those who did not. The potential effect of Internet-based self-help programmes was not possible to examine due to low compliance rates. Adolescents seem to have a very low compliance with Internet-based self-help programmes if left to their own incentive. There were no associations between the psychiatric and stress-related symptoms at baseline and compliance in any of the intervention groups, and no evidence for differences in compliance in relation to the type of programme. Additional studies are needed to examine how compliance rates can be increased in Internet-based self-help mindfulness programmes in adolescents, as the potentially positive effects of mindfulness are partly related to compliance rates.",

Recent literature has recommended the investigation of focused mindfulness interventions for voices (auditory hallucinations) as a specific experience. To date, only mindfulness programs in group format have been examined. Aims: This non-randomized pilot study aimed to assess the acceptability, feasibility and potential outcomes of an individual mindfulness program for persistent voices on the negative impact of voices on the subjective experience of mental health and wellbeing, depression and voice-related distress and disruption. Also, it aimed to identify potential psychological and neurocognitive mechanisms of change. Method: A new 4-week individual Mindfulness Program for Voices (iMPV) was developed, and piloted with a group of 14 participants with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and persisting voices. Participants completed clinical and neurocognitive measures pre- and post-intervention and at 2-month follow-up. Results: Results revealed low attrition rates, high formal practice engagement levels and positive participant feedback. Pre-post outcomes suggested small to moderate effects for a reduction in the negative impact of voices on experience, depression and disruption. Large effects for changes in mindful responding and attentional switching were also identified. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that this novel treatment protocol is appropriate, engaging and safe for persistent voice hearers. Findings for mindful responding and attentional switching suggest these to be potential mechanisms of change for further investigation. Further RCTs are warranted to ascertain the feasibility and efficacy for focused mindfulness interventions for voices of individual format.",

In this paper, we propose a hypothetical causal model that argues for the role of mindfulness in positive reappraisal coping. Positive reappraisal is a critical component of meaning-based coping that enables individuals to adapt successfully to stressful life events. Mindfulness, as a metacognitive form of awareness, involves the process of decentering, a shifting of cognitive sets that enables alternate appraisals of life events. We review the concept of positive reappraisal in transactional stress and coping theory, then describe research and traditional literature related to mindfulness and positive reappraisal, and detail the central role of mindfulness in the reappraisal process. With this understanding, we present a causal model explicating the proposed mechanism. The discussion has implications for clinical practice, suggesting how mindfulness-based integrative medicine interventions can be designed to support adaptive coping processes.",

            "abstract": "Background: A central facet of the popular understanding of mindfulness practice is the non-judgmental observation of all thoughts and feelings. Savoring is a cognitive practice developed out of economics and positive psychology, which involves the conscious mental engagement with positively-valenced interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli, which in turn amplifies the derived pleasure experience. Results: When incorporated into mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), savoring holds promise in improving outcomes related to reward processing, such as positive affect and well-being. The growing body of mindfulness literature also suggests that the inclusion of savoring in MBIs may be key in treating disorders of reward dysregulation, such as addiction. If savoring does indeed reduce craving, this phenomenon offers a point of union for divergent neurobiological theories of addiction. Conclusion: In this commentary, we explore the existing literature on savoring and mindfulness practices as it relates to addictive disorders, posit underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, and present future areas of research.",

Overall, MBIs were associated with small treatment effects in studies using pre-post (g = 0.305, SE = 0.039) and controlled designs (g = 0.322, SE = 0.040). Treatment effects were measured after a follow-up period in 24 studies (n = 1963). Results demonstrated that treatment effects were larger at follow-up than post-treatment in pre-post (g = 0.462, SE = 0.1 1 8) and controlled designs (g = 0.402, SE = 0.081). Moderator analyses indicated that intervention setting and intervention dosage were not meaningfully related to outcomes after controlling for study design quality. With that said, the between-study heterogeneity in the intercept-only models was consistently small, thus limiting the amount of variance for the moderators to explain. A series of exploratory analyses were used to investigate the differential effectiveness of MBIs across four therapeutic process domains and seven therapeutic outcome domains.

We measured their quality of life, psychological status, and function. Results of 10 participants who completed the programme were compared to three drop-outs with complete data.EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTION: The intervention was delivered in 12-weekly group sessions.

A total of 347 effect sizes from 29 studies (N = 1,493) were synthesized using metaregression with robust variance estimation. Overall, MBIs had a medium treatment effect on teacher outcomes (g = .601, SE = .089). Visual and statistical evidence of publication bias suggested this estimate may be positively biased. Three potential study-level moderators for overall effects were also examined, but none were statistically significant. MBIs were associated with small-to-medium positive effects on therapeutic processes and therapeutic outcomes. MBIs had the smallest effects on measures of classroom climate and instructional practices.

Although clinical interest has predominantly focused on mindfulness meditation, there also has been an increase in the scientific investigation of interventions that integrate other Buddhist principles such as compassion, loving kindness, and \"non-self.\" However, due to the rapidity at which Buddhism has been assimilated into the mental health setting, issues relating to the misapplication of Buddhist terms and practices have sometimes arisen. Indeed, hitherto, there has been no unified system for the effective clinical operationalization of Buddhist principles. Therefore, this paper aims to establish robust foundations for the ongoing clinical implementation of Buddhist principles by providing: (i) succinct and accurate interpretations of Buddhist terms and principles that have become embedded into the clinical practice literature, (ii) an overview of current directions in the clinical operationalization of BDIs, and (iii) an assessment of BDI clinical integration issues. It is concluded that BDIs may be effective treatments for a variety of psychopathologies including mood-spectrum disorders, substance-use disorders, and schizophrenia. However, further research and clinical evaluation is required to strengthen the evidence-base for existent interventions and for establishing new treatment applications. More important, there is a need for greater dialogue between Buddhist teachers and mental health clinicians and researchers to safeguard the ethical values, efficacy, and credibility of BDIs.",

Recent Findings There is a high rate of psychosocial comorbidity in BPS/IC, including elevated levels of anxiety and depression. Recent studies assessing the role of illness perceptions in BPS/IC relate poorer illness perceptions to more unhelpful illness coping patterns. Conversely, positive illness perceptions including self-efficacy in illness management are associated with more adaptive coping behaviors such as exercising and acceptance. New research is investigating the role of trauma in BPS/IC and the impact of suicidality. There is a paucity of psychosocial interventions for BPS/IC over the last 5 years. The three small-scale studies reviewed included a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention tailored for BPS/IC, a brief self-management intervention designed to increase patient knowledge and symptom management techniques and a 90-min interview aimed at increasing awareness about physiological affective relationship in IC. Illness-related cognitions impact illness-related coping behavior, distress, symptom severity, and QoL in BPS/IC. Positive illness perceptions can positively impact behavioral responses to illness and illness outcomes. Trauma, emotion regulation, and suicidality in BPS/IC are important factors for psychosocial interventions and multidisciplinary treatments to address. Insight from the existing evidence base and other functional illness areas such as IBS can be used to inform the design and assessment of interventions aimed to understand and treat BPS/IC as a biopsychosocial illness. The role of healthcare practitioners is fundamental to informing patient perceptions of their illness and providing adequate support for their own self-management approaches.",

The prevalence of mental and physical health conditions for people living in prison is greater than in community populations. After systematically searching 21 databases, we found no targeted interventions to support depression or anxiety for this group of people. 24 studies (including interventions of yoga, creative-arts-based programmes, positive psychology, or mindfulness-based interventions and psychotherapy) did contain people older than 50 years, but this only represented a minority (10%) of the overall study population. No single study reported outcomes of physical health. Future interventions need to consider the needs and views of this vulnerable group. Specific gendered and coproduced interventions are required to enhance the implementation, feasibility, and acceptability of interventions that are delivered in prisons.",

This article reviews the empirical literature on the effects of mindfulness on psychological health. We begin with a discussion of the construct of mindfulness, differences between Buddhist and Western psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been integrated into Western medicine and psychology, before reviewing three areas of empirical research: cross-sectional, correlational research on the associations between mindfulness and various indicators of psychological health: intervention research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on psychological health: and laboratory-based, experimental research on the immediate effects of mindfulness inductions on emotional and behavioral functioning. We conclude that mindfulness brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation. The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and suggested directions for future research.. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "Objective: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been related with improved job satisfaction, wellbeing, health, and reduced workplace stress with employees. However, until now, synthesis of the evidence of the effect of MBIs on physiological indices associated with stress and ill-health has been lacking. Therefore the current systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature from employee samples to provide guidance for future investigations in terms of which physiological indicators and biological systems may be most impacted by MBIs.Methods: Electronic databases were searched. Studies that conducted a mindfulness-based program with an employee sample, which targeted workplace stress or work engagement, and measured a physiological outcome were selected for inclusion. Studies using either a between-group or within-group design were included. Nine papers were found to meet the inclusion criteria for our systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.Results: MBIs were found to be effective in reducing cortisol production, as indicated by lowered high and low diurnal cortisol slopes. However, no changes were found for cortisol awakening response or concentrations for single a.m. and p.m. time-points. MBIs also improved autonomic balance, assessed by heart rate variability coherence measures, but not blood pressure. Sympathetic nervous system reactivity as measured by salivary alpha amylase was also reduced following MBI. While aspects of immune function were also improved following MBIs, specifically, increased antibody response to a viral vaccine and reduced C-reactive protein concentrations, each of these outcomes were only assessed in a single study.Conclusion: Taken together, the findings suggest that MBIs are a promising avenue for intervention for improving physiological indices of stress. Our findings suggest that changes in daytime cortisol secretion and HRV coherence may be particularly influenced by MBIs. Future studies should aim to assess multiple physiological indices to confirm the current findings and further improve current understanding of which biological systems (and indices within these systems) show responses indicative of reduced stress due to MBI.",

            "abstract": "Background: Nursing students face a great amount of psychological stress during their nursing education. Mindfulness-based training has received increased recognition from nurse educators regarding its effect on reducing students' psychological stress. Study evidence has supported that cultivation of trait mindfulness through Mindfulness-based training was the key to this effect. However, there is a lack of research that focuses on intricate relationships between various facets of trait mindfulness and psychological stress.Objective: Examining the relationships between various trait mindfulness facets and psychological stress.Design: A cross-sectional design was used to collect data on trait mindfulness facets and psychological stress.Participants: A convenience sample of 99 undergraduate nursing students from a Bachelor of Nursing program completed this study.Setting: This study was conducted in a university in the south-eastern United States.Method: Participants completed an online questionnaire, which collected their demographic information, trait mindfulness (the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire), and psychological stress (the Perceived Stress Scale-10). Correlation and mediation analyses were applied.Results: Other than the trait mindfulness facet of observing, the remaining three facets (acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity) were negatively correlated with psychological stress. Observing had little to low correlations with non-judging and acting with awareness, but attained a moderately positive correlation with non-reactivity. Moreover, observing could indirectly predict psychological stress, when non-reactivity served as a mediator. Finally, non-judging partially mediated the relationship between acting with awareness and psychological stress.Conclusions: The results of the current study can help nurse educators better understand the intricate relationships between various facets of trait mindfulness and psychological stress. Specifically, facets of acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity are directly relevant to the reduction of psychological stress. Therefore, regardless of formal or informal practices of mindfulness, nurse educators ought to assist students in cultivating these facets as means toward stress management.",

            "abstract": "Objectives The study of prosocial behaviour has accelerated greatly in the last 20 years. Researchers are exploring different domains of prosocial behaviour such as compassion, kindness, caring, cooperation, empathy, sympathy, love, altruism and morality. While these constructs can overlap, and are sometimes used interchangeably, they also have distinctive features that require careful elucidation. This paper discusses some of the controversies and complexities of describing different (prosocial) mental states, followed by a study investigating the differences between two related prosocial concepts: compassion and kindness. Methods For the study, a scenario-based questionnaire was developed to assess the degree to which a student (N = 222) and a community (N = 112) sample judged scenarios in terms of compassion or kindness. Subsequently, participants rated emotions (e.g. sadness, anxiety, anger, disgust, joy) associated with each scenario. Results Both groups clearly distinguished kindness from compassion in the scenarios on the basis of suffering. In addition, participants rated compassion-based scenarios as significantly higher on sadness, anger, anxiety and disgust, whereas kindness-based scenarios had higher levels of joy. As a follow-up, a further sample (29 male, 63 female) also rated compassionate scenarios as involving significantly more suffering compared to the kindness scenarios. Conclusions Although overlapping concepts, compassion and kindness are clearly understood as different processes with different foci, competencies and emotion textures. This has implications for research in prosocial behaviour, and the cultivation of kindness and compassion for psychotherapy and in general.",

First, as a field we need to go beyond behavior in our concepts of phenotypes, to also include the many medical, physical, and other \"non-behavioral\" phenotypes that influence children's everyday lives. Second, in examining how etiology-related phenotypes affect others, we need to go beyond the outcome of parental stress. In this regard, we focus on parental health, well-being, and various life choices, as well as how parenting children with specific genetic disorders can often lead to positive perceptions and outcomes.

Mindfulness, stress, negative and positive mood, medical symptoms and psychological symptoms were assessed before and after the intervention using self-report questionnaires. We compared pre and postintervention scores and examined the relationship between changes in mindfulness and changes in stress, mood and medical symptoms.RESULTS: Mindfulness scores were significantly higher after intervention, both on the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Changes on the KIMS were associated with reductions in stress, negative mood, psychological symptoms and total medical symptoms, and improvement in positive mood. Changes in mindfulness, as measured by the MAAS, were significantly correlated only with reduced total number of medical symptoms.CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for the positive health impact of MBSR on urban South Africans, and in turn acceptability and feasibility evidence for MBSR in South Africa and supports the case for larger trials in different local settings.",

This study aimed to examine how the BDNF Val 66Met polymorphism interacted with stressful life events and positive mothering to influence youth trait anxiety. The study sample included 780 community adolescents of Chinese Han ethnicity (M = 13.6, 51.3% females). Participants' trait anxiety, exposure to stressful life events, and mother's warmth-reasoning were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. We found that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism significantly moderated the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety. The influences were significantly greater in adolescents carrying one or two Val allele than those with Met/Met genotype. Moreover, the G x E interactions were more consistent with the differential susceptibility than the diathesis-stress model. Adolescents carrying Val allele who were more susceptible to adversity were also more likely to benefit from supportive experiences. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of BDNF Val66Met as a genetic susceptibility modulating the influences of stressful life events and mother's warmth-reasoning on adolescent anxiety. We speculate that BDNF Val66Met may moderate anxious youths' responses to mindfulness-based stress reduction program and family-based treatment targeting the enhancement of positive parenting.

Due to the significant impact of this comorbidity on treatment adherence and maternal/child outcomes, effective psychosocial and behavioral interventions to address depression and anxiety in this population are necessary. A directed search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases produced 22 articles from 20 distinct studies examining non-pharmacologic interventions with an effect on depression and anxiety among pregnant or parenting women using substances. Of the 20 studies reviewed, 8 were randomized controlled trials, 7 were quasi-experimental studies, and 5 were cohort studies.

Parenting therapy and psychosocially enhanced treatment programs had the strongest evidence for positive treatment effect in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety.

            "abstract": "Research into subjective well-being (SWB) focuses on conducive life conditions, healthy cognitive-affective processes and adaptive behaviours, however, in this model, well-being fluctuates based on changing mental and physical phenomena. This inquiry explores the possibility that we can have a nondual experience of well-being that is unaffected by such movements and investigates if the literature supports this. The assertion in traditional mindfulness that the sense of self is constructed and responsible for such fluctuations is explored, along with what evidence there is that mindfulness practices deliver relevant cognitive and behavioural correlates associated with such a way of being. Proposed preconditions include (a) nondual awareness or the perception of no-self; (b) increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and increased self-lessness; (c) increased capacity to maintain (or protect) well-being including heightened emotional self-regulation and resilience to aversive stimuli. Research findings provide some evidence that the sense of self can be both constructed and deconstructed, and that mindfulness training may target psychological dimensions that could contribute to an experience of well-being that transcends the impact of life conditions. Recommendations are made for a collaborative relationship between SWB research and mindfulness to expand the inquiry into possible causes and conditions of 'nondual well-being'.",

            "abstract": "Ethical decision-making (EDM) theories in behavioural ethics management have been developed through the social sciences, psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neurosciences. These theories are either cognitive, non-cognitive or an integration of both. Other scholars have recommended redefining what ethical means through moral philosophy and theology. Buddhism is a religion, a philosophy, a psychology, an ethical system and an art of living. The divine states (i.e. loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity) in Buddhism are virtues that could be developed by anyone regardless of their religion or non-religion through Buddhist meditation. They are so called because they enable individuals to develop 'God-like qualities'. The theoretical insights of the divine states indicate how to eliminate negative emotions, such as anger, fear, delusion and envy, by cultivating love and compassion towards both the self and others. Accordingly, this paper contributes to EDM by redefining what ethical means through the meanings managers who practise Buddhist meditation assign to divine states in their lived experience of EDM in organisations in Sri Lanka. The sample consisted of 17 Buddhists, 1 Hindu, 1 Muslim and 1 no-religion. Data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews and was analysed with IPA. The findings indicated that how the managers made meaning of an ethical decision was influenced by their loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. The findings also indicated that the managers justified the reasons for their decisions subsequently through the benefits to themselves as well as their employees. Accordingly, this study supports the view that EDM is an integrated approach.",

The objective was by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the current evidence for the effect of MBT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients and survivors. Method: Electronic databases were searched, and researchers were contacted for further relevant studies. Twenty-two independent studies with a total of 1,403 participants were included. Studies were coded for quality (range: 0-4), and overall effect size analyses were performed separately for nonrandomized studies (K = 13, n = 448) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs; K = 9, n = 955). Effect sizes were combined using the random-effects model. Results: In the aggregated sample of nonrandomized studies (average quality score: 0.5), MBT was associated with significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression from pre- to posttreatment corresponding to moderate effect sizes (Hedges's g) of 0.60 and 0.42, respectively. The pooled controlled effect sizes (Hedges's g) of RCTs (average quality score: 2.9) were 0.37 for anxiety symptoms (p < .001) and 0.44 for symptoms of depression (p < .001). These effect sizes appeared robust. Furthermore, in RCTs, MBT significantly improved mindfulness skills (Hedges's g = 0.39). Conclusion: While the overall quality of existing clinical trials varies considerably, there appears to be some positive evidence from relatively high-quality RCTs to support the use of MBT for cancer patients and survivors with symptoms of anxiety and depression.",

            "abstract": "Aim: Recently, a mindfulness therapy for people with psychotic disorders was developed. However, clinicians and researchers are cautious given case reports in which extensive meditation provoked psychotic symptoms in people with a psychotic disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, adverse effects and possible favourable effects of mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) in people recently recovering from a first episode of psychosis. Method: A nonrandomized, non-controlled prospective follow-up study. Patients were offered an MBT that consisted of eight 1-hour sessions within a 4-week time span. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Symptoms Checklist 90 and the Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire were assessed before and after the therapy. Results: Of the 16 persons who started MBT, 13 completed (81.5%) the therapy. No significant increase in psychotic symptoms was found. Between two meetings, one participant initially misunderstood the mindfulness instructions, which led to an increase in distress. No increased awareness of intrusive thoughts or visual or auditory hallucinations was reported by participants. We found a decrease in agoraphobic symptoms (p < 0.028) and in psychoneuroticism (P < 0.025). Conclusion: The MBT had no significant adverse effect on psychotic symptoms in patients in this small pilot study, neither did it raise the level of mindfulness in the participants. A decrease in psychological symptoms was found, although one patient experienced an increase in symptoms of distress. Our study demonstrates that therapists should be cautious that therapy and practice instructions are understood properly. Future studies are feasible and needed, in larger samples with an RCT design, in order to draw conclusions regarding the effects of the MBT.",

Evidence shows promise, as youth who engage in yoga to promote mindfulness show improved coping skills, increased socio-emotional competence and prosocial skills, academic performance, attention span, and ability to deal with stress.Objective This study reports the results of a program evaluation of a universal health and wellness curriculum, Pure Power, designed to teach youth yoga techniques, mindfulness, and emotion regulation.Methods A non-randomized comparison design examined outcomes among participants from schools that completed the intervention with highest fidelity of implementation (n = 461) and from students in matched comparison schools (n = 420). Standard measures of coping, emotion regulation and emotion dysregulation, spelling, and math achievement were collected.Results Analyses suggest the youth in the intervention schools demonstrated relative improvement on measures of emotion regulation, spelling, and math.Conclusions Challenges in implementation in real-life settings are vital to identify. The data provide some real-world evidence for the effectiveness of a universal health and wellness curriculum on emotion regulation and positive academic outcomes. Training school staff to deliver the intervention may foster implementation. Future research should test the effectiveness of who delivers the intervention; for example, teacher-delivered groups vs. other wellness personnel.",

Emotional and general physical well-being, sense of coherence, overall psychologic distress, and satisfaction with life were measured with standardized instruments.RESULTS: Overall, the interventions led to high levels of adherence to the meditation practice and satisfaction with the benefits of the course, as well as effective and lasting reductions of symptoms (especially in psychologic distress, well-being, and quality of life). Changes were of moderate-to-large effect sizes. Positive complementary effects with psychotherapy were also found.CONCLUSIONS: These findings warrant controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction as an intervention for chronic physical and psychosomatic disorders in Germany.",

            "abstract": "Depression is a common symptom among college students and is often accompanied by negative thoughts about oneself. Self-compassion is a technique students can use to combat those negative thoughts. Self-compassion is an emotion-regulation strategy in which the individual engages in self-kindness, particularly after a mistake, failure, and/or rejection. This paper reviews the concept of self-compassion, assessment of self-compassion, and interventions that have been shown to increase self-compassion. Self-compassion is associated with lower levels of psychopathology and higher levels of well-being. It is theorized to work by buffering against a self-critical ruminative process after a mistake, failure, and/or rejection. Self-compassion is most commonly assessed through a validated scale that measures overall self-compassion and its six subscales: self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness, self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification. Multiple self-compassion interventions have been shown to increase self-compassion and improve psychological health. These interventions are varied and contain strategies such as mindfulness meditation, loving kindness meditation, and changing self-talk. Details of those interventions and practical strategies that individuals, students, and professors can use to increase self-compassion are described. Overall, self-compassion is a valuable tool that can help individuals cope with mistakes, failure, and/or rejection.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness practices have exploded onto the mainstream North American cultural landscape. Not surprisingly, proponents of mindfulness can also be found within education systems in North America and the western world more generally. In Canada, mindfulness-based programs have filtered into faculties of education as well as public school classrooms. Yet, despite the rapid spread of the mindfulness movement, relatively little is known about it historically. This article pieces together some of the key intellectual and cultural developments that have enabled the growth of this phenomenon: North Americans' encounters with Buddhist perspectives since the 1950s and 1960s, the intersection of psychology and Buddhist practice, the flourishing of progressive educational ideals, and the growth of school psychology. It then briefly explores the kinds of citizenship ideals promoted by mindfulness practices as well as educators' rationales for their implementation. Tracing this history demonstrates that, despite its relatively recent entry into schools and its promotion as a scientifically-based physiological practice, mindfulness is a phenomenon with deep historical roots within a particular British and North American social and cultural context. Exploring this context and the reasons for educators' turn to mindfulness will help us better understand our modern education system and the kinds of students it aims to produce.",

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is designed especially for depressive people in reducing risk of depression relapse and is recommended in national guidelines as a treatment choice for relapse prevention in recurrent depression. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness training on depressive symptoms of international students and probe into the mediating role of mindfulness in stressful events and depression. In addition, we introduced a new kind of mindfulness training, the breathing exercise-based mindfulness training, which is based on the integration of Buddhism and Daoism. Self-report questionnaires assessing the coping style, abnormal depressive behavior, and stressful live events were completed in 260 international students in China (mean age=21.4years). The results showed that (1) many international students showed depression symptoms, (2) stressful life events play a completely mediating role in the initiation of depression and anxiety, and (3) mindfulness training for 8 weeks significantly reduced the depressive symptoms, and it was also related to a positive coping style. This study has certain theoretical significance in exploring the mechanism of the occurrence and development of depression among international students and provides useful tools for this special group of international students. In addition, the international students can also learn Chinese culture through the training. These findings indicate that mindfulness training and positive coping style are interrelated with treating depressive symptoms for international students.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) are increasingly used to reduce parental stress and to enhance dyadic interactions between parents and children. Prior reviews examining the effects of MPBs for parents have assessed restricted target populations, limited outcomes measures, and have relied on uncontrolled studies. This systematic and meta-analytic review quantified the efficacy of MBPs for parents using comprehensive intrapersonal and interpersonal outcome measures and methodologically robust studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect of MBPs on parents were identified, data were extracted, and assessed for risk of bias by two independent reviewers. Twenty studies (n = 1003) were included in the analyses. Programs had moderate effects for general stress (Hedge's g = 0.410), internalizing psychological symptoms (Hedge's g = 0.519), and well-being (Hedge's g = 0.588). Small-to-moderate effects were observed for combined mindfulness (Hedge's g = 0.295), parenting stress (Hedge's g = 0.284), and parenting behavior (Hedge's g = 0.299). Effects were not significant for parental interactions with children, marital outcomes, self-compassion, emotion regulation, general mindfulness, and mindful parenting. Subgroup analyses revealed that populations with medical conditions (Hedge's g = 1.203) benefited more from MBPs compared to populations with psychological symptoms (Hedge's g = 0.452). Furthermore, parents showed greater improvement on well-being when both parents and children engaged in mindfulness training (Hedge's g = 0.838) compared to parents alone (Hedge's g = 0.700). Results support the efficacy of MBPs in improving intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes for parents. Diversity within the programs may contribute towards non-significant changes in general mindfulness and mindful parenting. Future studies should use standardized mindfulness-based parenting programs to enhance methodological rigor.",

We examine self-transcendence, or the drive to benefit others beyond the self, as a key mechanism through which meditation may promote positive social outcomes. Self-transcendence cultivated through various styles of meditation can impact social outcomes through two main pathways: First, self-transcendence can turn rigid, defensive self-focus into flexible and receptive self-construals. Second, it can increase positive other-focus by integrating reward and social signals in the brain. These accounts offer one practical solution of positively transforming social relations and highlight potential usefulness of considering self-transcendence in researching social effects of meditation.",

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies and Guided Imagery (GI) interventions in managing chronic non-cancer pain and related outcomes. Materials and Methods: Searching three electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus) and following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was performed on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and pilot RCTs investigating mindfulness or GI interventions in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was utilized to assess the quality of the evidence, with outcomes encompassing pain intensity, opioid consumption, and non-sensorial dimensions of pain. Results: Twenty-six trials met the inclusion criteria, with most of them exhibiting a moderate to high risk of bias. A wide diversity of chronic pain types were under analysis. Amongst the mindfulness interventions, and besides the classical programs, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) emerges as an approach that improves interoception. Six trials demonstrated that mindfulness techniques resulted in a significant reduction in pain intensity, and three trials also reported significant outcomes with GI. Evidence supports a significant improvement in non-sensory dimensions of pain in ten trials using mindfulness and in two trials involving GI. Significant effects on opioid consumption were reported in four mindfulness-based trials, whereas one study involving GI found a small effect with that variable. Conclusions: This study supports the evidence of benefits of both mindfulness techniques and GI interventions in the management of chronic non-cancer pain. Regarding the various mindfulness interventions, a specific emphasis on the positive results of MORE should be highlighted. Future studies should focus on specific pain types, explore different durations of the mindfulness and GI interventions, and evaluate emotion-related outcomes.",

Data collection included focus group discussions with adolescents (n = 24) and teachers (n = 12), semistructured interviews with school principals (n = 12), program delivering teachers (n = 7), and program staff (n = 4). A thematic analysis was performed using NVivo 12. Results: Overall, the mindfulness-based classroom curriculum was strongly supported by participants. Acceptability was determined by positive responses, prosocial behavior, self-acceptance, and supportive bonds, according to students. Several themes of perceived benefits of the program including, improved relationships among peers and between students and teachers were identified. In general, the teachers' interviews indicated that there was a high level of satisfaction with the training and curriculum provided by the program. Teachers were able to provide high coverage (75%-80%) of the program activities, but several potential barriers were also identified, including insufficient training for teachers and the need for direct supervision.Conclusion: The Heartfulness Way program, a social-emotional learning intervention, has shown strong support for acceptance and delivery by school communities.

To date, only one study has focused on the effect of long-term meditation on stress, showing a positive protective relationship. However, the relationship between meditation and cancer incidence remains unexplored. The objective of this study was to describe the state-level relationship between MBSR instructors and their practices and county-level health outcomes, including cancer incidence, in the United States.Methods: This ecologic study was performed using geospatial mapping and descriptive epidemiology of statewide MBSR characteristics and overall health, mental health state rankings, and age-adjusted cancer incidence rates.Results: Weak to moderate state-level correlations between meditation characteristics and colorectal and cervical cancer incidence were detected, with states with more meditation (e.g., more MBSR teachers per population) correlated with a decreased cancer incidence. A negative correlation was detected between lung & bronchus cancer and years teaching MBSR only. Moderate positive correlations were detected between Hodgkin's Lymphoma and female breast cancer in relation to all meditation characteristics. Statistically significant correlations with moderate coefficients were detected for overall health ranks and all meditation characteristics, most strongly for total number of years teaching MBSR and total number of years of general meditation practice.Conclusions: Our analyses might suggest that a relationship exists between the total number of MBSR teachers per state and the total number of years of general meditation practice per state, and colorectal and cervical cancer incidence. Positive correlations were observed with overall health rankings. Despite this study's limitations, its findings could serve to generate hypotheses and to inform and motivate a new focus on meditation and stress reduction in relation to cancer incidence, with specific relevance to colorectal and cervical cancer.",

Outcomes of distress, quality of life (QOL), post-traumatic growth, and mindfulness were assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and again 3 months later using validated measures. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVAs with a Bonferroni correction. Participant satisfaction and evaluation were also assessed.Forty-two women completed the program, and complete data were available for 36 women. Significant improvements with large effect sizes (eta rho(2)) were observed for distress (P < 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.238), QOL (P = 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.204), mindfulness (P < 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.363) and post-traumatic growth (P < 0.001; eta rho(2) = 0.243). Gains were maintained 3 months post-intervention. Improvements in outcomes did not differ based on diagnostic group, psychological status, or physical well-being at entry. Change indices further support these findings. Scores on measures of distress, QOL, and post-traumatic growth decreased as a function of increased mindfulness at each time point (all P < 0.05). Participants reported experiencing the program as beneficial, particularly its group-based nature, and provided positive feedback of the therapy as a whole as well as its individual components.Within the limits of a non-randomized trial, these findings provide preliminary support for the potential psychosocial benefits of MBCT in a heterogeneous group of women with cancer.

Significant improvements in anxiety and overall distress as well as across multiple domains of QOL were observed from baseline to post-MBSR. Reductions in anxiety and overall distress were associated with reductions in CRP. Patients who reported improvement in overall mental well-being also showed increased NK cytolytic activity from pre- to post-MBSR, whereas patients who reported no improvement in mental well-being showed no change in NK cytolytic activity.Conclusions: Positive improvement in psychologic well-being following MBSR was associated with increased NK cytolytic activity and decreased levels of CRP.",

            "abstract": "Background: Chronic pain is a prevalent disorder in nursing workers worldwide. Several studies have proposed measures to mitigate this critical scenario. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been found to have promising results in the treatment of this disorder.Aims: To quantify the effectiveness of an adapted mindfulness program (AMP) in the management of musculoskeletal pain (MSP) in nursing technicians of a Brazilian university hospital.Design: This study was a clinical, prospective, open, repeated measures trial, with data collection between January and July 2015.Settings: Brazilian university hospital.Participants/Subjects: Sixty-four female nursing technicians with a mean age of 47.01 years (standard deviation = 9.50) with chronic pain symptoms.Methods: Sixty-four female nursing technicians with a mean age of 47.01 years (standard deviation = 9.50) and MSP participated in this prospective study. Before the intervention (T0), scores of anxiety, depression, mindfulness, musculoskeletal complaints, pain catastrophizing, self-compassion, and perception of quality of life were quantified. These scores were reevaluated after 8 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks (T2) of weekly AMP sessions (60 minutes each). The variables were evaluated by analysis of variance for repeated measures, followed by the Bonferroni test.Results: AMP reduced the scores of musculoskeletal symptoms, anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing (p < .001). A significant increase was identified in self-compassion scores and perception of quality of life in the physical, psychological, and overall assessment (p <= .04). Positive effects of AMP occurred at T1 and remained unchanged at T2.Conclusion: AMP contributed to a reduction in painful symptoms and improved the quality of life of nursing workers, with a lasting effect until the 20th week of follow-up, indicating utility as an effective strategy for the management of MSP in the group studied.

            "abstract": "Patients with fibromyalgia must simultaneously cope with chronic pain, emotional distress, activity avoidance and disability. The majority of fibromyalgia patients are women. New interventions using information and communications technologies such as Internet applications and smart phones can be used for text-based communications between providers and patients with chronic pain. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore female patients' experiences of participating in a 4-week web-based home intervention after in-house multidimensional rehabilitation. The framework of the intervention was inspired by mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy using daily diaries and situational feedback as tools. Interviews were made with seven women about their general experiences of participation, specific relationship with the therapist, coimnunication, activity, emotions, and coping. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using systematic text condensation. A main result was that informants experienced this follow-up program as consciousness expanding as well as both motivating and supportive. Another main result was their reported ambivalence in relation to: 1) using web-based technology; 2) experiencing feedback as challenging but positive; and 3) experiencing relationships of trust and detachment with the therapist. Web-based nursing stimulates a \"zone for reflection\" that may assist in the counseling and support of patients with chronic pain. However, this is a new area of research that needs to be further explored. (C) 2012 by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing",

While systematic reviews on MBSR have taken place for a number of conditions there remains limited information on its impact on individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).Methods: Medline, Central, Embase, Amed, CINAHAL were searched in March 2016. These databases were searched using a combination of MeSH subject headings where available and keywords in the title and abstracts. We also searched the reference lists of related reviews. Study quality was assessed based on questions from the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.Results: Two interventions and three papers with a total of 66 participants were included. The interventions were undertaken in Belgium (n = 27) and the USA (n = 39). One study reported significantly increased grey matter density (GMD) in the brains of the MBSR group compared to the usual care group. Significant improvements were reported in one study for a number of outcomes including PD outcomes, depression, mindfulness, and quality of life indicators. Only one intervention was of reasonable quality and both interventions failed to control for potential confounders in the analysis. Adverse events and reasons for drop-outs were not reported. There was also no reporting on the costs/benefits of the intervention or how they affected health service utilisation.Conclusion: This systematic review found limited and inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of MBSR for PD patients. Both of the included interventions claimed positive effects for PD patients but significant outcomes were often contradicted by other results. Further trials with larger sample sizes, control groups and longer follow-ups are needed before the evidence for MBSR in PD can be conclusively judged.",

            "abstract": "Perfectionism, problem solving, and mindfulness have all been variously implicated in the experience and treatment outcomes for depression. Maladaptive perfectionism represents a cognitive set that is believed to exacerbate the symptoms of depression, whereas social problem solving is believed to play a role in potentially buffering the effects of perfectionism on depressive symptomatology. Little is currently known about the role of mindfulness during a current depressive episode, however a number of studies have shown that mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduce relapse rates in depression. The current study examined the role of social problem solving, adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism, and mindful awareness during a current depressive episode. Participants were 141 inpatients experiencing a clinical depressive episode. No support was found for social problem solving buffering the effects of maladaptive perfectionism on depression severity. Results suggest that mindful awareness mediates the negative association between social problem solving and depression severity and the positive association between maladaptive perfectionism and depression severity. Mindful awareness contributed the greatest amount of variance to depression symptom severity.",

Derived from a central exercise of mindfulness-based interventions, 42 undergraduates were asked to observe their breath for about 18 min. Within this time period, they were prompted 22 times at irregular intervals to indicate whether they had lost mindful contact with their breath as a result of mind wandering. The results show negative correlations between the degree of the ability to stay mindfully in contact with the breath and measures of rumination, repetitive negative thinking, and depression. Moreover, positive associations with self-report data of mindfulness and a negative relationship to fear of bodily sensations support the construct validity of our new approach for the assessment of mindfulness. In summary, findings suggest the healthy quality of mindful breathing regarding depression-related processes.",

Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to extend previous investigations of the relationship between DM and the BF, utilizing a larger sample of studies, attending to relational inconsistencies potentially associated with alternative methods of operationalizing DM, conducting the first meta-analysis of the DM subdomains in relation to the BF, and situating the results in a cybernetic model. Results indicate that neuroticism evidenced the strongest, negative relationship with DM and conscientiousness evidenced the strongest, positive relationship with DM, suggesting the mindful personality may be characterized principally by emotional stability and conscientious self-regulation-potentially reflective of an inclination towards the personality metatrait stability. Measurement differences were also observed, with the mindful personality arrived at through the FFMQ differing to some extent from the mindful personality emerging from the MAAS. Broadly, the mindful personality associated with the FFMQ appears to reflect greater personality complexity, with the FFMQ evidencing associations with all five personality factors while the MAAS appears primarily linked with only three personality factors (neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness). Examination of the relationships between the BF and DM at the facet level also suggests unique patterns of association between the DM facets and each of the personality factors.",

Six databases were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from their inception to April 2023. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs was applied to assess the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Twenty-five RCTs involving 1915 participants were identified. The results indicated that CBIs reduced parental stress levels (Hedges' g = - 0.69), depressive symptoms (g = - 0.95), anxiety levels (g = - 0.78), and parental distress (g = - 0.29), and improved parental well-being (g = 0.62) and parent-child relationships (g = 0.43) postintervention compared with the active/inactive control groups. Subgroup analysis of the effectiveness of interventions using mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioural therapy showed positive effects. The favourable intervention duration and participant targets were also identified in this review. Furthermore, the effects of CBIs were impacted by the different types of DD among the children. This review highlighted the positive effects of CBIs on parental stress levels, depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, parental distress levels, parental well-being levels, and parent-child relationships. Future well-designed RCTs are needed to further investigate the effects of MBIs and CBT interventions on children with DD and their parents, as well as the factors and mechanisms of action affecting the efficacy of these interventions.",

Employing a quasi-experimental longitudinal design with an active control group, the present study examined whether practicing mindfulness may attenuate time pressure and lead to more time affluence. Corroborating and extending findings on positive effects of mindfulness practice, the presented longitudinal study suggests that compared with a physically exercising control group, participation in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program leads to increases in time affluence and subjective well-being. Further, a mediation analysis revealed that the effect of increased mindfulness on subjective well-being is partially mediated through this increase in time affluence. As the first longitudinal study suggesting a change of time affluence as a result of participation in an MBSR program, this work enriches the research on mindfulness and time affluence and provides important impetus for future research. Moreover, this research provides an explanation for the well-established effects of mindfulness practice on well-being: increased subjective time affluence plays a mediating role. The paper underlines the importance of considering time affluence as an element of well-being in mindfulness and general psychology research alike.",

Meditation practice is associated with improvement in concentration and reduction of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, different forms of meditation training are now being used as interventions for a variety of psychological and somatic illnesses. These benefits are thought to occur as a result of neurophysiologic changes. Themost commonly studied specificmeditation practices are focused attention (FA), open-monitoring (OM), as well as transcendental meditation (TM), and loving-kindness (LK) meditation. In this review, we compare the neural oscillatory patterns during these forms of meditation.Method: We performed a systematic review of neural oscillations during FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation practices, comparing meditators to meditation-naive adults.Results: FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation are associated with global increases in oscillatory activity inmeditators compared tomeditation-naive adults, with larger changes occurring as the length of meditation training increases. While FA and OM are related to increases in anterior theta activity, only FA is associated with changes in posterior theta oscillations. Alpha activity increases in posterior brain regions during both FA and OM. In anterior regions, FA shows a bilateral increase in alpha power, while OM shows a decrease only in left-sided power. Gamma activity in these meditation practices is similar in frontal regions, but increases are variable in parietal and occipital regions.Conclusions: The current literature suggests distinct differences in neural oscillatory activity among FA, OM, TM, and LK meditation practices. Further characterizing these oscillatory changes may better elucidate the cognitive and therapeutic effects of specific meditation practices, and potentially lead to the development of novel neuromodulation targets to take advantage of their benefits.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundPregnancy and the postpartum period are times of significant transition for women, with changes in maternal physical and mental health. The formation of a relationship between a mother and her baby is vital and has been recognised as laying the foundation for later child development. There is considerable evidence that this early relationship is influenced by a woman's well-being during pregnancy and in the early post-partum period. Mindfulness-based programs have previously revealed positive outcomes, primarily in reducing maternal stress, anxiety, and depression. However, there remains a need for considering the influence of mindfulness on the mother-baby relationship and embodiment during pregnancy and the first trimester post-partum. This study aimed to conduct an in-depth exploration of pregnant women's experiences of a nine-session prenatal mindfulness relationship-based (PMRB) program to support its feasibility.MethodsInformation about pregnant women's (n = 13) experiences of the PMRB program was collected through online interviews during the sessions, including their birth stories. Responses to an open-ended question about how the program had supported them during pregnancy, labour/birth, and the first post-partum trimester were summarised using thematic analysis.ResultsSixteen themes were identified and organised in four categories: (1) expectations and motivations (healthy pregnancy and mental health, non-medicalised birth, contribution to the field); (2) experiences of the PMRB program (positive experiences, shared experience, engagement with mindfulness practices, pain, stress, and anxiety relief); (3) changes attributed to the PMRB program (a new way of responding to stressors, trusting the process, connecting to body, breath, and unborn baby, awareness of the unborn baby as a sentient being); (4) changes attributed to the mindfulness practice (increased mindfulness/self-awareness, stop look listen, embracing the moment, acceptance).ConclusionsThe evaluation suggested the PMRB program may help women cope with pain and emotional challenges and be more connected to their bodies and infant. The program may also help women become more aware of their unborn baby as a sentient being and the influence of their health and mental well-being on the baby development and health. Furthermore, the program may facilitate the mother-baby relationship during pregnancy, post-partum, and breastfeeding.PreregistrationThe trial has been successfully registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) following ethical approval from Bond University Human Research Ethics Committee (BUHREC-Application AS03534, approved 20 December 2022) and allocated the Australian clinical trials registration number (ACTRN): ACTRN12623000679684.",

            "abstract": "Can adopting one's morning routines influence employees' experiences throughout the day? To answer this focal question, we examine the daily effects of a brief meditation in the morning on well-being throughout the day considering spillover effects from the home to the work domain and back. To identify the dominant underlying mechanisms of this daily spillover, we draw on the personality systems interactions theory that distinguishes between autonomous self-regulation and effortful self-control as two psychological processes that reflect the regulation of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in alignment or contradiction with one's interests, values, and goals. Accordingly, we hypothesized that meditating in the morning before work fosters autonomous self-regulation and reduces effortful self-control in the work domain, which subsequently facilitates the experience of flow at work and hence fosters subjective vitality in the home domain after work. A quasi-experimental daily-diary study over 10 days with a brief 10-min mindfulness intervention during the final 5 days with 78 participants (588 day-level data points) supported most of our predictions. More specifically, our data suggest a positive indirect effect of the intervention on subjective vitality in the evening via self-regulation and flow experience. However, there was no indirect effect of the intervention on subjective vitality via self-control. The results help to clarify how a mindfulness-based intervention can influence distinct regulatory processes and well-being, crossing boundaries between the work and home domains.",

Although Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) directly aims to address this mechanism of CR, the relationship between mindfulness and CR has not been tested to date. Using a cross-sectional design (Study 1; n = 164) and a non-randomized waiting list controlled design (Study 2; MBCT [n = 181 vs. waiting list [it = 211), the authors examined the relationship between naturally occurring levels of mindfulness (Study 1) and MBCT (Study 2) on the one hand, and CR on the other hand. In line with predictions, it was found that (a) trait mindfulness is significantly negatively correlated with CR, even when controlled for current depressive symptoms and prior history of depression (Study I), and that (b) MBCT, compared to a matched control group, significantly reduces CR, and that this effect of MBCT on reduction of CR is mediated by a positive change in mindfulness skills (Study 2). Results provide first evidence for the claim that mindfulness practices in MBCT are designed to address the process of CR. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "Background: Mind-body practices are increasingly used to provide stress reduction for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health.Methods: This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD.Results: The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal.Conclusions: Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care.",

            "title": "Toward a brain theory of meditation",
            "abstract": "The rapidly progressing science of meditation has led to insights about the neural correlates of focused attention meditation (FAM), open monitoring meditation (OMM), compassion meditation (CM) and loving kindness meditation (LKM), in terms of states and traits. However, a unified theoretical understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in meditation-related functions, including mindfulness, is lacking. After reviewing the main forms of meditation and their relationships, the major brain networks and brain states, as well as influential theoretical views of consciousness, we outline a Brain Theory of Meditation (BTM). BTM takes the lead from considerations about the roles of the major brain networks, i.e., the central executive, salience and default mode networks, and their interplay, in meditation, and from an essential energetic limitation of the human brain, such that only up to 1% of the neurons in the cortex can be concurrently activated. The development of the theory is also guided by our neuroscientific studies with the outstanding participation of Theravada Buddhist monks, with other relevant findings in literature. BTM suggests mechanisms for the different forms of meditation, with the down-regulation of brain network activities in FAM, the gating and tuning of network coupling in OMM, and state-related up-regulation effects in CM and LKM. The theory also advances a leftward asymmetry in top-down regulation, and an enhanced interhemispheric integration, in meditation states and traits, also with implications for a theoretical understanding of conscious access. Meditation thus provides a meta-function for an efficient brain/mind regulation, and a flexible allocation of highly limited and often constrained (e.g., by negative emotion and mind wandering) brain activity resources, which can be related to mindfulness. Finally, a series of experimental predictions is derived from the theory.",

Comprehensive searches identified 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria (N=1059; M age=42years; 20% women). Participants had been living with HIV for an average of 8years (range=<1-20years); 65% were currently on antiretroviral therapy. Between-group analyses indicated that depressive symptoms were reduced among participants receiving the MBIs compared to controls (d+=0.37, 95% CI 0.03, 0.71). Within-group analyses showed reductions in psychological symptoms (i.e., less anxiety, fewer depressive symptoms) and improved quality of life over time among MBI participants (d+s=0.40-0.85). No significant changes were observed for immunological outcomes (i.e., CD4 counts) between- or within-groups. MBIs may be a promising approach for reducing psychological symptoms and improving quality of life among PLWHA. Studies using stronger designs (i.e., randomized controlled trials) with larger sample sizes and longer follow-ups are needed to clarify the potential benefits of MBIs for PLWHA. ResumenEste metaanalisis examino los efectos de las intervenciones basadas en la atencion plena (MBI) sobre el estres, los sintomas psicologicos y los biomarcadores de enfermedades entre las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA. Las busquedas exhaustivas identificaron 16 estudios que cumplieron con los criterios de inclusion (N=1059; M edad=42 anos, 20% mujeres). Los participantes habian estado viviendo con VIH durante un promedio de 8 anos (rango=<1 a 20 anos); el 65% estaba actualmente en tratamiento antirretroviral. Los analisis entre grupos indicaron que los sintomas depresivos se redujeron entre los participantes que recibieron los MBI en comparacion con los controles (d+=0.37; 95% CI 0.03, 0.71). Los analisis dentro del grupo mostraron reducciones en los sintomas psicologicos (es decir, menos ansiedad, menos sintomas depresivos) y una mejor calidad de vida con el tiempo entre los participantes con MBI (d+s=0.40-0.85). No se observaron cambios significativos en los resultados inmunologicos (es decir, recuentos de CD4) entre grupos o dentro de ellos. Los MBI pueden ser un enfoque prometedor para reducir los sintomas psicologicos y mejorar la calidad de vida entre las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA. Se necesitan estudios que utilicen disenos mas fuertes (es decir, ensayos controlados aleatorios) con tamanos de muestra mas grandes y seguimientos mas largos para aclarar los beneficios potenciales de los MBI para personas que viven con VIH/SIDA.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to conduct a test of acceptability of a new model for family-focused drug prevention programs for families of early adolescents. An existing evidence-based behavioral intervention, the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP), was adapted to include concepts and activities related to mindfulness and mindful parenting (an extension of mindfulness to the interpersonal domain of parent-child relationships). The foundation for this innovative intervention approach stems from research on the effects of mind-body treatments involving mindfulness meditation and the function of stress and coping in relation to parenting and parent well-being. One group of families participated in a seven-week pilot of this mindfulness-enhanced version of SFP. Results of a mixed-method implementation evaluation suggest that the new intervention activities were generally feasible to deliver, acceptable to participants, and perceived to yield positive benefits for family functioning and parent psychological well-being. The next phase of this research will involve curriculum refinement based upon results of this initial study, and a larger pilot efficacy trial will be conducted.",

Methods: Studies were identified through searching six electronic databases using combinations of three groups of keywords and manual search. Two independent reviewers screened the searched studies, extracted data of the included studies, and assessed the study quality. The extracted data were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: Ten studies consisting of two controlled trials, six surveys, and two interview studies met the inclusion criteria. The two controlled trials had weak methodological quality, and the remaining studies were of moderate to high research quality. Results of controlled trials and interview research generally showed that MBIs had positive effects in burnout prevention. Meta-analytic results indicated a negative association between mindfulness and burnout. Conclusions: There is some evidence showing that mindfulness was negatively associated with athlete burnout. However, given the small number of interventions and qualitative studies, there is limited evidence on whether MBIs are useful in preventing athlete burnout.

Whether learning such theories results in ethical behavior change remains an open question. If one of the goals of teaching ethics is to support ethical behavior, then alternative approaches are merited. Within the past decades, there has been a growing emphasis on mindfulness and compassion-based practices in particular, as applied to psychotherapy in the field of psychology. Such findings have bearing on ways in which compassion-based practices might be fruitful in the philosophical ethics classroom. This article will identify issues with the dominant approach to teaching philosophical ethics, focusing on the need for a bridge between theory and action. It will also explore the potential benefits of utilizing mindfulness in the classroom, with a focus on compassion-based practices such as loving-kindness, to contribute to meeting this need to enhance the teaching of undergraduate philosophical ethics.

            "abstract": "Objectives: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have become increasingly popular for treating various physical and mental disorders. An increase in mindfulness levels through the teaching of mindfulness meditation is the most well-studied mechanism of MBIs. Recent studies, however, suggest that an increase in mindfulness is also observed in physical or psychosocial interventions not explicitly labeled as MBIs, or what the authors call non-MBIs. The authors aimed to review what non-MBIs can increase mindfulness levels despite not explicitly teaching mindfulness meditation. Design: The authors conducted a literature search for studies that included a non-MBI study arm measuring pre- and postintervention mindfulness levels using one of the following eight validated self-reported mindfulness questionnaires: Five-Faceted Mindfulness Questionnaire, Mindful Awareness and Attention Scale, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, Toronto Mindfulness Scale, Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale, Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills, Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, and Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised. The authors identified 69 non-MBI study arms from 51 independent studies of the non-MBI itself or as active controls of an MBI under investigation. The authors documented or calculated, if not provided, effect sizes (ES) for changes in mindfulness levels following these interventions. Results: Among the 69 non-MBI arms, 36 showed no effect for change in mindfulness (ES <0.20), 3 were indeterminate (no ES available or unable to calculate), 13 had small effects (0.20 < ES <0.5), 13 had medium effects (0.50 < ES <0.80), 3 had large effects (0.80 < ES <1.3), and 1 had a very large effect (ES >1.3) for change in mindfulness. Conclusions: Analysis of the characteristics of non-MBIs with significant increases in mindfulness levels suggested some commonalities between MBIs and non-MBIs, shedding light on a spectrum of mindfulness-related interventions and the possibility that there are many roads to developing mindfulness.",

Methods Inmates over the age of 45years who passed a cognitive screening completed face-to-face interviews (N=94; mean age=57.7years; SD=10.68). Multiple regression analyses included age, race/ethnicity, parole belief, physical health, positive or negative religious coping, and all two-way interactions represented by the product of health and a religious coping variable. Results Older inmates and those who reported greater levels of positive religious coping endorsed fewer symptoms of depression, whereas those who reported greater levels of negative religious coping endorsed more symptoms of depression. Inmates who reported higher levels of depression endorsed a greater desire for hastened death. The effect of physical functioning on desire for hastened death is moderated by negative religious coping such that those who endorsed higher levels of negative religious coping reported a greater desire for hastened death. Conclusions Examinations of religious/spiritual practices and mindfulness-based interventions in prison research have assumed a positive stance with regard to the potential impact of religious/spiritual coping on physical and mental health.

All three positive emotions significantly reduced anxiety, but happiness and love yielded significantly greater reductions than compassion. As a secondary dependent variable, anger showed a similar pattern of results, being significantly reduced by happiness and love but not by compassion. Thus, the relative effectiveness of these positive emotions in relieving both anxiety and anger was not a function of their superordinate emotion category (happiness versus love), but rather was a function of the specific emotion.

Each MBSR group consisted of nine weekly sessions of MBSR instruction. This mixed-methods evaluation consisted of quantitative data-attendance, psychologic symptoms (Symptom Checklist 90-Revised), and quality of life (Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent Edition)-and qualitative data-in-depth individual interviews conducted in a convenience sample of participants until interview themes were saturated. Analysis involved comparison of pre-and postintervention surveys and content analysis of interviews.Results: Thirty-three (33) youth attended at least one MBSR session. Of the 33 who attended any sessions, 26 youth (79%) attended the majority of the MBSR sessions and were considered \"program completers.\" Among program completers, 11 were HIV-infected, 77% were female, all were African American, and the average age was 16.8 years. Quantitative data show that following the MBSR program, participants had a significant reduction in hostility (p = 0.02), general discomfort (p = 0.01), and emotional discomfort (p 0.02). Qualitative data (n = 10) show perceived improvements in interpersonal relationships (including less conflict), school achievement, physical health, and reduced stress.Conclusions: The data suggest that MBSR instruction for urban youth may have a positive effect in domains related to hostility, interpersonal relationships, school achievement, and physical health. However, because of the small sample size and lack of control group, it cannot be distinguished whether the changes observed are due to MBSR or to nonspecific group effects.

It hasbeen shown to improve the health and therapeutic outcomes for patients by improving diagnosis and compliance. In the West, front-line medical professionals, including herbal medicine practitioners, put themselves at risk of burnout and compassion fatigue by giving emotionally intensive care. While treatments for compassion fatigue and burnout are available, another way forward is needed to ensure healthcare professionals do not become ill; one that will enable both patients and healthcare professionals to receive the care needed. In this paper it is argued that compassion, which is defined in this paper, involves different neural circuitry to empathy and can protect healthcare professionals from the effects of stress that can, if not addressed, lead to burnout. Traditional Buddhist meditation techniques such as loving-kindness meditation have been shown to increase compassion in non-meditative states. Short daily sessions of such mediation practices have been shown to improve compassion in a way that protects healthcare professionals from burnout. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH.",

The most well-established of these interventions typically involve relatively large resource commitments, in terms of both the provider and participant.

Methods include pure and guided self-help utilising resources such as books and workbooks, computer programmes and applications and audio-visual materials. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that have evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of low-intensity interventions including mindfulness and acceptance-based components. Fifteen RCTs (7 ACT-based, 4 mindfulness-based and 4 multi-component interventions including elements of mindfulness and/or acceptance) were identified and reviewed. Interventions that included mindfulness and/or acceptance-based components produced significant benefits in comparison to control conditions on measures of mindfulness/acceptance, depression and anxiety with small to medium effect sizes. Engagement with the self-help interventions varied but on average two-thirds of participants completed post-intervention measures. Emerging research into low-intensity mindfulness and acceptance-based interventions is hopeful. Recommendations fOr research and practice are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) is a weekly 8-session, mindfulness-based, manual-guided, individual intervention targeting addiction and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors that integrates cognitive behavioral strategies with Buddhist principles and clients' religious/spiritual beliefs. 3-S is efficacious for reducing drug use and HIV risk behaviors among mixed-gender, methadone-maintained outpatients. The study goal was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of 3-S therapy among urban, low-income Latinas (n = 13) in residential addiction treatment. Data gathered via in-person interviews (baseline, 8 and 20 weeks postentry) showed high rates of 3-S acceptability and positive changes in a number of outcomes relevant to recovery from addiction and to HIV prevention, including impulsivity, spirituality, motivation for change, and HIV prevention knowledge. The study findings are promising; however, a controlled study with longer follow-up is needed to rigorously assess the efficacy of 3-S therapy with Latinas in substance abuse treatment.",

            "abstract": "Objective The current study aims to examine parenting anxiety and negative parenting practices as intervening variables in the relation between parental dispositional mindfulness and Chinese adolescents' externalizing problems. Background Parental dispositional mindfulness is negatively associated with their adolescents' adjustment difficulties through both positive and negative parenting practices in Western samples. However, research does not support these same pathways of effects among Eastern samples. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative mediators of the link between parental mindfulness and lower adolescent adjustment problems in Eastern cultures. The present study addresses this need by examining parenting anxiety as a mechanism linking parental dispositional mindfulness, negative parenting practices, and Chinese adolescents' externalizing problems. Methods Participants were 624 adolescents (aged from 9 to 18 years, M = 12.69 years, SD = 2.30) and their parents from urban areas in Southeast China. Parents completed questionnaires on their dispositional mindful awareness, parenting anxiety, and negative parenting practices, and adolescents reported on their externalizing problems. Results Structural equation modeling revealed that the indirect relation between parental dispositional mindful awareness and adolescents' externalizing problems was significant, with parenting anxiety and negative parenting practices as the first and second intervening variables. Conclusion The results highlighted the importance of parenting anxiety in the relation between parental mindful awareness and parenting. Implications It suggested that mindfulness-based parenting interventions may help alleviate parenting anxiety, which may further improve parenting behaviors and indirectly decrease adolescents' externalizing problems.",

            "abstract": "Purpose Emotional eating is important to study and address because it predicts poor outcome in weight loss interventions. Interventions have only touched the surface in terms of addressing emotional eating. Mindfulness approaches can address emotional eating by modification of emotion regulation and appetitive traits. The current study involved development of an emotional eating-specific mindfulness intervention and assessment of its effect on appetitive traits associated with emotional eating. Methods Participants (n = 14; age M = 29 years; 90% female) completed baseline and end-of-intervention self-report measures of emotional eating, food-cue reactivity, mindfulness, intuitive eating, emotional impulse regulation, stress, and a behavioural measure of inhibitory control. During the 6-week intervention, mindfulness meditation skills were taught weekly embedded in a psycho-educational curriculum about emotional eating. Results Paired t tests, controlled for type 1 error, revealed significant improvements in food-cue reactivity, intuitive eating, emotional impulse regulation, inhibitory control and stress (ps < 0.05; d: 0.58-1.54). Changes in emotional eating approached significance (p = 0.075, d = 0.66). Conclusion The intervention purposefully did not focus on weight loss and recruited participants who had self-declared difficulties with emotional eating. The positive outcomes suggest that intervening with mindfulness training before weight loss is attempted has the potential to change psychological factors that underpin overeating and undermine weight loss efforts. The study provides proof of principle as a basis to design a randomized control trial to assess rigorously the effectiveness of the intervention as a precursor to a weight loss intervention.",

            "abstract": "While the field of empirical study on religion and spirituality in relation to mental health has rapidly expanded over the past decade, little is known about underlying dimensions of spirituality cross-culturally conceived. We aimed to bridge this gap by inductively deriving potential universal dimensions of spirituality through a large-scale, multi-national data collection, and examining the relationships of these dimensions with common psychiatric conditions. Five-thousand five-hundred and twelve participants from China, India, and the United States completed a two-hour online survey consisting of wide-ranging measures of the lived experience of spirituality, as well as clinical assessments. A series of inductive Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and cross-validating Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) were conducted to derive common underlying dimensions of spirituality. Logistic regression analyses were then conducted with each dimension to predict depression, suicidal ideation, generalized anxiety, and substance-related disorders. Preliminary EFA results were consistently supported by ESEM findings. Analyses of 40 spirituality measures revealed five invariant factors across countries which were interpreted as five dimensions of universal spiritual experience, specifically: love, in the fabric of relationships and as a sacred reality; unifying interconnectedness, as a sense of energetic oneness with other beings in the universe; altruism, as a commitment beyond the self with care and service; contemplative practice, such as meditation, prayer, yoga, or qigong: and religious and spiritual reflection and commitment, as a life well-examined. Love, interconnectedness, and altruism were associated with less risk of psychopathology for all countries. Religious and spiritual reflection and commitment and contemplative practice were associated with less risk in India and the United States but associated with greater risk in China. Education was directly associated with dimensions of spiritual awareness in India and China but inversely associated with dimensions in the United States. Findings support the notion that spirituality is a universal phenomenon with potentially universal dimensions. These aspects of spirituality may each offer protective effects against psychiatric symptoms and disorders and suggest new directions for treatment.",

            "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted virtually every aspect of daily living, engendering forced isolation and social distance, economic hardship, fears of contracting a potentially lethal illness and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Unfortunately, there is no formula or operating manual for how to cope with the current global pandemic. Previous research has documented an array of responses to mass crises or disasters, including chronic anxiety and posttraumatic stress as well as resilience and recovery. Much can be learned from this research about how people have coped in the past in order to identify strategies that may be particularly effective in managing distress and cultivating resilience during these perilous times. We delineate multiple coping strategies (e.g., behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, loving-kindness practices) geared to decrease stress and promote resilience and recovery. These strategics may be especially effective because they help individuals make meaning, build distress tolerance, increase social support, foster a view of our deep human interconnectedness, and take goal-directed value-driven actions in midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, treatment of chronic illnesses, such as stroke, cancer, chronic heart and respiratory diseases, osteoarthritis, diabetes, and so forth, account for the largest part of expenses in western countries national health systems. Moreover, these diseases are by far the leading causes of mortality in the world, representing 60% of all deaths. Any treatment aimed at targeting them might engage an individual for a large portion of his/her life so that personal and environmental factors can play a crucial role in modulating the person's quality of life and functioning, on top of any medical cure. Anxiety, depression, and distress for examples are not rare in patients with chronic diseases. Therefore, Cognitive and Behavior Therapy research has largely contributed in the last decades in identifying and programming interventions on such aspects as real and perceived social and family support, coping abilities, locus of control, self-efficacy that might help patients living with their chronic disease. More recently, third generation Cognitive-Behavior-Therapies, such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) and Acceptance, and Commitment Therapy (ACT) focused their attention and research efforts on developing intervention models targeting the needs of patients with a chronic disease. This paper has three aims. First is to briefly introduce ACT epistemological (Functional Contextualism) and theoretical (Relational Frame Theory) foundations as a stand point for understanding the peculiarity of ACT as a modern form of Clinical Behavior Analysis. The second aim is to introduce ACT clinical model and its six core processes (acceptance, defusion, present moment, self as a context, values and committed action) as both accountable, in their continuum, for psychological flexibility and inflexibility. Third, to present a brief overview of studies and outcomes of ACT intervention protocols and assessment tools that have been investigated in patients with chronic physical diseases, and namely: diabetes, obesity, epilepsy, and chronic pain.",

            "abstract": "This report from the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research considers the current status and future directions in research on psychological therapies targeting auditory hallucinations (hearing voices). Therapy approaches have evolved from behavioral and coping-focused interventions, through formulation-driven interventions using methods from cognitive therapy, to a number of contemporary developments. Recent developments include the application of acceptance-and mindfulness-based approaches, and consolidation of methods for working with connections between voices and views of self, others, relationships and personal history. In this article, we discuss the development of therapies for voices and review the empirical findings. This review shows that psychological therapies are broadly effective for people with positive symptoms, but that more research is required to understand the specific application of therapies to voices. Six key research directions are identified: (1) moving beyond the focus on overall efficacy to understand specific therapeutic processes targeting voices, (2) better targeting psychological processes associated with voices such as trauma, cognitive mechanisms, and personal recovery, (3) more focused measurement of the intended outcomes of therapy, (4) understanding individual differences among voice hearers, (5) extending beyond a focus on voices and schizophrenia into other populations and sensory modalities, and (6) shaping interventions for service implementation.",

            "abstract": "Background: People with an advanced progressive illness and their caregivers frequently experience anxiety, uncertainty and anticipatory grief. Traditional approaches to address psychological concerns aim to modify dysfunctional thinking; however, this is limited in palliative care, as often concerns area valid and thought modification is unrealistic. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a mindfulness-based behavioural therapy aimed at promoting acceptance and valued living even in difficult circumstances. Evidence on its value in palliative care is emerging. Aims: To scope the evidence regarding Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for people with advanced progressive illness, their caregivers and staff involved in their care. Design: Systematic scoping review using four databases (Medline, PsychInfo, CINAHL and AMED), with relevant MeSH terms and keywords from January 1999 to May 2023. Results: 1,373 papers were identified and 26 were eligible for inclusion. These involved people with advanced progressive illness (n = 14), informal caregivers (n = 4), palliative care staff (n = 3), bereaved carers (n = 3), and mixed groups (n = 2). Intervention studies (n = 15) showed that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable and may have positive effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and sleep in palliative care populations. Observational studies (n = 11) revealed positive relationships between acceptance and adjustment to loss and physical function. Conclusion: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is acceptable and feasible in palliative care, and may improve anxiety, depression, and distress. Full scale mixed-method evaluation studies are now needed to demonstrate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness amongst patients; while further intervention development and feasibility studies are warranted to explore its value for bereaved carers and staff.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to improve chronic pain and associated conditions like depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. However, there is limited research on how veterans with chronic pain apply mindfulness skills to manage pain in daily life. This cross-sectional study examined the association between applied mindfulness practice, pain, and several pain-related conditions among 1,737 veterans with chronic pain prior to enrollment in a trial of 2 MBIs. Applied mindfulness practice was assessed using the Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS). Theoutcomes included pain interference, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, physical function, and social participation. Higher overall AMPS scores, as well as the positive and negative emotional regulation subscales of the AMPS, were associated with less pain interference and catastrophizing, as well as better outcomes for all pain-related conditions. The positive emotional regulation subscale had the strongest associations with outcomes. There was no significant association between the AMPS and pain intensity. Theresults suggest applied mindfulness practice, especially positive emotional regulation, may improve pain and functioning. In addition, the AMPS shows promise as a process measure of mindfulness skills applied in daily life. Additional research is needed to examine different aspects of mindfulness in the context of MBIs. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes the relationship between applied mindfulness practice and pain-related outcomes, prior to a MBI, using a novel measure of mindfulness practice. These findings underscore the importance of measuring applied mindfulness practice prior to and during clinical interventions to treat chronic pain.",

The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between trait mindfulness and the (1) psychological functioning, (2) health behaviors, (3) and physical health of caregivers for individuals diagnosed with cancer. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted with family caregivers of individuals diagnosed with cancer . Caregivers were recruited for the study during oncology appointments with their loved ones at twelve academic and community oncology centers located in western Pennsylvania. Caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires and examinations assessing sociodemographic characteristics, trait mindfulness, depression, perceived stress, caregiver stress, sleep, diet, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use, blood pressure, and BMI. Demographic and cancer-related information was collected from the individuals whom caregivers supported and the medical chart. Linear, logistic, and ordinal regression were performed.Results: Of the 77 caregivers, the mean age was 64 (S.D.= 10.7); 60% identified as female; 97% identified as White; the response rate was 72.6%. Regression analyses indicated that caregivers who reported higher levels of trait mindfulness reported significantly lower levels of depression ( 3=-0.35, SE = 1.13, 95% CI =-5.95,-1.43, p = .002), better caregiver quality of life ( 3=-0.422, SE = 2.17, 95% CI =-13.03,-4.38, p < .001), lower levels of perceived stress ( 3=-.517, SE = 0.90, 95% CI =-6.06,-2.47, p < .001), better sleep quality ( 3=-0.23, SE = 0.44, 95% CI =-1.78,-0.2, p = 0.05), lower rates of tobacco use (OR = 7.15; 95% CI = 1.36, 37.47, p = .007), and greater levels of physical activity ( X 2 = 20.60, p < .001). Trait mindfulness was not significantly related to diet, alcohol use, blood pressure, or BMI.Conclusions: Findings indicated that higher levels of trait mindfulness are associated with positive mental and physical health outcomes for caregivers.

With convincing evidence that parenting a child with ASD is associated with elevated distress and mental health problems, researchers have begun to investigate treatments that directly target parents' psychological well-being. We conducted a narrative review of studies that empirically tested the effects of interventions targeting improvements in the mental health of parents of children with ASD. Following a range of search strategies, a total of 13 studies, seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six pre-post test designs, met inclusion criteria. We calculated and reported effect sizes for all RCTs. On average, treatment produced medium to large effect sizes with improvements in parenting stress and general health, and reductions in depression and anxiety. Interventions that appeared promising included: Stress Management and Relaxation Techniques, Expressive Writing, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. However, only one study conducted a follow-up assessment >3 months post intervention. Study populations primarily consisted of English-speaking mothers, ages 39 to 42 years. Conclusions were limited by small sample sizes, homogeneity of sample population, and reliance on self-report Therefore, this body of research contains significant limitations in need of improvement for this field to move forward and benefit a sizable number of parents.

We systematically reviewed 78 functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) studies of meditation, and used activation likelihood estimation to meta-analyze 257 peak foci from 31 experiments involving 527 participants. We found reliably dissociable patterns of brain activation and deactivation for four common styles of meditation (focused attention, mantra recitation, open monitoring, and compassion/loving-kindness), and suggestive differences for three others (visualization, sense-withdrawal, and non-dual awareness practices). Overall, dissociable activation patterns are congruent with the psychological and behavioral aims of each practice. Some brain areas are recruited consistently across multiple techniques including insula, pre/supplementary motor cortices, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex but convergence is the exception rather than the rule. A preliminary effect-size meta-analysis found medium effects for both activations (d = 0.59) and deactivations (d = -0.74), suggesting potential practical significance. Our meta-analysis supports the neurophysiological dissociability of meditation practices, but also raises many methodological concerns and suggests avenues for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One of these ideas is the quadripartite framework of the immeasurable states' (aprameya/appameya) or divine abidings' (brahmavihra), the most prominent of which in popular Buddhism is mett (friendliness/loving-kindness).

Patients expressed positive feedback and reported positive changes they felt would last for the rest of their lives. Focusing on the issue of what works, four categories of interest were identified from the transcribed interviews: lessons learned, being oneself, permanence, and continuity as a condition for success.Conclusions: Mindfulness meditation makes a difference for patients. Patients felt rested and in better control of their pain and its role in their life. Only older age predicted better outcome, but patients who recognized that pain is part of their life and were living under stable conditions may have been more likely to learn and put forth personal effort, which may have made change possible. More specific variables have to be developed to study good match between the specific intervention and the specific patient.",

            "abstract": "The effects of two kinds of meditation (open presence and focused) on the facial and physiological aspects of the defensive response to an aversive startle stimulus were studied in a Buddhist monk with approximately 40 years of meditation experience. The participant was exposed to a 115-db, 100-ms acoustic startle stimulus under the 2 meditation conditions, a distraction condition (to control for cognitive and attentional load) and an unanticipated condition (startle presented without warning or instruction). A completely counterbalanced 24-trial, single-subject design was used, with each condition repeated 6 times. Most aspects of the participant's responses in the unanticipated condition did not differ from those of a comparison group of 12 age-matched male controls. Both kinds of meditation produced physiological and facial responses to the startle that were smaller than in the distraction condition. Within meditation conditions, open presence meditation produced smaller physiological and facial responses than focused meditation. These results from a single highly expert meditator indicate that these 2 kinds of meditation can differentially alter the magnitude of a primitive defensive response.",

            "title": "Feasibility and Acceptability of Mindfulness-Based Group Visits for Smoking Cessation in Low-Socioeconomic Status and Minority Smokers with Cancer",
            "abstract": "Objective: Smoking cessation studies tailored for low-income and racial/ethnic minority cancer patients are limited. African American and low-socioeconomic status (SES) smokers have higher cancer mortality rates and are less likely to use evidence-based smoking cessation treatments compared with white and higher SES counterparts. Mindfulness training is a promising approach to address racial and SES disparities in smoking cessation. The authors assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation (MBSC) medical group visit for low-income and racially diverse smokers with cancer. Design and intervention: The authors adapted the integrative medical group visit model used for chronic pain and included the You Can Quit smoking cessation curriculum used at the study site, Tobacco Treatment Center. The program was conducted in eight weekly 2-h visits. The authors then tested the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention for actively smoking cancer patients and cancer survivors in two pilot groups (N = 18) using a pre-post design. Setting/Location: This study took place at Boston Medical Center, a large urban safety net academic teaching hospital. Outcome measures: The authors used a medical group visit intake form to collect data on weekly cigarette intake and home practice. They also gathered additional qualitative data from focus groups and in-depth interviews. Results: Over 50% of participants (n = 10) self-identified as black and 56% reported an annual income of $20,000 or less. Over two-thirds of the participants attended four or more of the eight group visits. There was a significant decrease in weekly cigarette intake from 75.1 cigarettes at baseline to 44.3 at 3 months (p = 0.039). None of the participants quit smoking. Participants were satisfied with the program and reported positive lifestyle changes. Conclusion: MBSC group visits are feasible and acceptable among racially diverse and low-SES smokers with cancer and should be further studied in a larger cohort.",

Objective: The objective of this review was to identify the instruments used to assess ME and IE among higher education students and outcomes related to these dimensions. Methods: This review was carried out according to the PRISMA statement, through systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Scopus. The inclusion criteria selected for higher education students, levels of ME and/or IE reported, and observational and clinical studies. The exclusion criteria selected against reviews, qualitative studies, and case studies. Quality was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist. Results: A total of 516 initial records were identified, from which 75 were included. Cross-sectional studies were the most common research design (86.7%). Most studies were conducted with samples that were predominantly female (90.7%), White (76.0%), aged 18 to 22 years (88.4%), with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (83.0%), and in the United States (61.3%). The Intuitive Eating Scale (IES), the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ), and their different versions were the most used instruments.

            "abstract": "This review is an attempt to provide a comprehensive view of post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD) and its therapy, focusing on the use of meditation interventions. PTSD is a multimodal psycho-physiological-behavioral disorder, which calls for the potential usefulness of spiritual therapy. Recent times witness a substantial scientific interest in an alternative mind-to-body psychobehavioral therapy; the exemplary of which is meditation. Meditation is a form of mental exercise that has an extensive, albeit still mostly empiric, therapeutic value. Meditation steadily gains an increasing popularity as a psychobehavioral adjunct to therapy in many areas of medicine and psychology. While the review does not provide a final or conclusive answer on the use of meditation in PTSD treatment we believe the available empirical evidence demonstrates that meditation is associated with overall reduction in PTSD symptoms, and it improves mental and somatic quality of life of PTSD patients. Therefore, studies give a clear cue for a trial of meditation-associated techniques as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy or standalone treatment in otherwise resistant cases of the disease.",

            "abstract": "Although research has identified dozens of behavioral and psychosocial strategies for boosting resilience in adults, little is known about the common underlying pathways. A comprehensive review of these strategies using an affective neuroscience approach indicates three distinct general routes to resilience: 1) down-regulating the negative (e.g., exposure, cognitive reappraisal) by reducing distress-related responses of the amygdala, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and autonomic nervous system; 2) up-regulating the positive (e.g., optimism, social connectedness) by activating mesostriatal reward pathways, which in turn can buffer the effects of stress; and 3) transcending the self (e.g., mindfulness, religious engagement) by reducing activation in the default mode network, a network associated with self-reflection, mind-wandering, and rumination. Some strategies (e.g., social support) can boost resilience via more than one pathway. Under- or over-stimulation of a pathway can result in vulnerability, such as over-stimulation of the reward pathway through substance abuse. This tripartite model of resilience-building is testable, accounts for a large body of data on adult resilience, and makes new predictions with implications for practice.",

This study also examines whether the hypothesized reduction in existential isolation resulting from the intensive meditation practice predicts other-focused compassion. Study 1 utilized a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of meditation on existential isolation and other compassion by comparing healthy Koreans who completed a 7-day intensive silent Zen meditation (n = 35) with those who completed a 7-day vacation (n = 30). All participants completed measures twice: at baseline and after either their meditation retreat or their vacation. Study 2 used a longitudinal design to investigate whether Study 1 findings would replicate among 75 new TempleStay program participants. In Study 1, relative to participants in the vacation group, participants in the meditation group experienced reduced existential isolation and increased other-focused compassion from Time 1 to Time 2. Reductions in existential isolation mediated the increases in other-focused compassion. In Study 2, after a 1-week intensive meditation training, participants experienced a reduction in existential isolation and an increased in other-focused compassion; again, the reductions in existential isolation mediated increases in other-focused compassion. Across two studies, we found evidence of reduced existential isolation and increased other-focused compassion following an intensive Zen-meditation practice. These results indicate that meditation practice may help people who suffer from existential isolation, as well as the people with whom they interact.",

The design of the study is cross-sectional and uses data from both a clinical (N = 172) and a non-clinical sample (N = 638). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used to identify and validate first order factors related to cognitive restructuring and acceptance, and regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the identified factors and the criterion variables. In sum, the findings from the study indicate that acceptance and cognitive restructuring should not be regarded as unitary and non-related constructs, but rather as partly overlapping general dimensions of emotion regulation consisting of several sub constructs or conceptual nuances with somewhat different psychological functions and properties. The results are interpreted and discussed in relation to the ongoing discussion within clinical psychology concerning the concepts and processes related to cognitive restructuring and acceptance.",

The research team utilised an iterative inductive approach to coding of the transcripts from these focus groups. Five themes emerged: stressors, signs of stress, coping, lack of access and acceptability of care, and motivation and trust in care engagement. These focus groups revealed a desire for a group intervention that could decrease isolation while protecting against involuntary disclosure of HIV status. Participants expressed openness to mindfulness skills for coping with stress.

Methods: Twenty-five participants completed self-report measures assessing worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ), anxiety (Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3), and trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS) at T0 (pre-lockdown, 4 November 2019-17 February 2020) and T1 (at the end of lockdown, 26 April-30 April 2020). We compared assessments at the two time points in the whole sample and in high and low worriers (defined at T0 by scores on PSWQ respectively above and below 1.5 SD from mean of the Italian normative sample). Outcomes: High worriers showed at T1 a significant increase of anxiety sensitivity and fear of mental health in comparison to low worriers. Moreover, in the whole sample, at T1 trait mindfulness was inversely related to worry and fear of mental health. Interpretation: A valuable approach to support individuals experiencing anxiety related to the COVID-19 outbreak could be represented by mindfulness-based interventions improving the ability to focus attention and awareness on the present moment.",

We included studies that described interventions that focused on reducing the PTSD symptoms of healthcare professionals. A narrative synthesis was adopted to synthesise the data. Results A total of eight studies out of 2558 articles were identified. Six used a quantitative study design and two adopted qualitative methods. cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness-based interventions were the most commonly adopted. Most studies used a combination of different intervention strategies. Trauma-related knowledge, emotion regulation and relaxation skill training, and psychological support from peers and psychologists were three core intervention components. The duration ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months. Healthcare professionals who participated in training programmes reported both positive experiences and suggestions for the improvement of PTSD-reducing interventions in their qualitative feedback. Conclusions The scoping review provides a practical summary of the intervention characteristics for reducing the PTSD symptoms of healthcare professionals. Hospitals and managers could use the overview of interventions to assist healthcare professionals with PTSD symptoms. More research investigating the effects of PTSD symptom-reducing interventions for healthcare professionals with appropriate follow-up assessments is needed in the future.",

In searching for the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial impact of meditation, studies have revealed practice-induced alterations of neurotransmitters, brain activity, and cognitive abilities, just to name a few. These findings not only imply a close link between meditation and brain structure, but also suggest possible modulating effects of meditation on age-related brain atrophy. Given that normal aging is associated with significant loss of brain tissue, meditation-induced growth and/or preservation might manifest as a seemingly reduced brain age in meditators (i.e., cerebral measures characteristic of younger brains). Surprisingly, there are only three published studies that have addressed the question of whether meditation diminishes age-related brain degeneration. This paper reviews these three studies with respect to the brain attributes studied, the analytical strategies applied, and the findings revealed.

            "abstract": "Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating, recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness. Love-as a trait and a momentary emotionis unique among positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage prosocial behavior.",

One effective psychological treatment for these patients is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). The aim of this paper is to describe the therapeutic intervention and effects of EMDR in a pool of COVID-19 survivors referred to an integrated psychological/psychiatric outpatient service. Twelve patients, comprising of nine males and three females, underwent EMDR psychotherapy from October 2020 to February 2022. Each patient received 8-16 weekly treatment sessions. The standard EMDR protocol of eight stages was administered to enable desensitization and reprocessing of four main targets: first positive swab, hospitalization, isolation and fear for relatives' health. Efficacy of EMDR was demonstrated by the significant improvement at clinical scale for subjective distress caused by traumatic events. For the therapists, carrying out these treatments was an intense and challenging experience. In fact, the perceived distance between therapist and patient was less defined than in other hospital settings because the pandemic affects everyone equally. However, with the widespread availability of vaccines and although the pandemic is still ongoing with the emergence of new variants, a window of improvement in the mental health landscape is starting to open up.",

Method N = 169 university students received either mindfulness training (experimental groups), awareness activities (active control group), or no training (passive control group), in the context of university seminars. Allocation to groups was bound by the seminar chosen by participants, and in that sense was self-selected. Mindfulness was trained in two adapted MBSR courses, one of which including yoga, and the other excluding yoga. Results Specific benefits of both mindfulness training groups were observed for emotion regulation in terms of an increase in cognitive reappraisal and a reduction in symptom-focused rumination as well as depressive mood. No benefits of mindfulness training were observed for reductions in expressive suppression, self-focused rumination, anxious, and negative mood or an increase in distraction and positive mood respectively. Mindfulness training with and without yoga was mostly equally effective. Outcomes were largely not moderated by practice quantity or quality, but reductions in depressive mood were mediated by gains in reappraisal and distraction. Conclusions Mindfulness training can be implemented in the context of university seminars to foster advantageous emotion regulation strategies and lower depressive mood in future schoolteachers.

Participants (n = 76) were men (24 %) and women (76 %) with an average age of 56.5 years (SD = 9.4). Participants were at least 1 year post-treatment, with no evidence of cancer, and with symptoms of neuropathic pain for more than three months. Participants completed the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), along with measures of pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, pain interference, depression, and HRQOL.Mindfulness was negatively correlated with pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, pain interference, and depression, and it was positively correlated with mental health-related HRQOL. Regression analyses demonstrated that mindfulness was a negative predictor of pain intensity and depression and a positive predictor of mental HRQOL after controlling for pain catastrophizing, age, and gender. The two mindfulness facets that were most consistently associated with better outcomes were non-judging and acting with awareness. Mindfulness significantly moderated the relationships between pain intensity and pain catastrophizing and between pain intensity and pain interference.It appears that mindfulness mitigates the impact of pain experiences in cancer survivors experiencing CNP post-treatment.This study suggests that mindfulness is associated with better adjustment to CNP.

For healthcare professionals, mindfulness meditation is claimed to reduce stress, anxiety and burnout, and enhance resilience.Objective: The objective of this integrative review was to critically appraise the literature that related to the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation programs for nurses and nursing students.Design: This review was conducted using Whittemore and knafl's framework for integrated reviews.Data Sources: Using the terms mindfulness, mindfulness-based-stress reduction, Vipassana, nurses, and nurse education a comprehensive search of the following electronic databases was conducted: CINAHAL, Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE. EMCARE, ERIC and SCOPUS.Review Methods: The initial search located 1703 articles. After screening and checking for eligibility 20 articles were critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for qualitative papers and McMaster's Critical appraisal form for quantitative papers. The final number of papers included in the review was 16.Results: The results of this review identified that mindfulness meditation has a positive impact on nurses' and nursing students' stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, sense of well-being and empathy. However, the majority of the papers described small scale localised studies which limits generalisability.Conclusion: Contemporary healthcare is challenging and complex. This review indicated that mindfulness meditation is an effective strategy for preventing and managing the workplace stress and burnout, which so often plague nursing staff and students. Further studies with larger sample sizes using rigorous research methods would be useful in extending this work.",

            "abstract": "Background. While today's older adults experience longevity, they often manage several chronic conditions and increasingly serve as informal caregivers for aging parents, children with life-long disabilities, and spouses. Older adult caregivers managing personal chronic illness often experience significant psychosocial hardships. Objective. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of older adult caregivers in an online, interactive mindfulness intervention. Methods. Self-reported older caregivers who participated in an online-based mindfulness program (n = 20) were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to provide feedback about any previous experience with mindfulness and/or meditation, hopes or goals held prior to the start of the program, desired expectations, motivation for joining, impressions of sessions, most beneficial topics, potential application of content, and any perceived effects. Participants' responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results. Five themes emerged from the analysis: Managing the Comprehensive Effects of Caregiving, Openness to Meditation and Mindfulness, Course Engagement and Incremental Growth, Building Rapport through Shared Experiences, and Ongoing Application and Opportunities for Refinement. Participants reported both short-term post-exercise benefits such as increased calm, relaxation, and stress relief, as well as long-term positive outcomes. Notably, participants found the program's unique interactive feature to be particularly beneficial as a form of perceived social support. Conclusions. Caregivers for older adults may derive benefit and potentially experience reduced subjective caregiver burden as a result of participating in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, particularly when the program is augmented with a self-compassion approach and perceived social support.",

An experimental study was performed in which we studied the effects of 8 weeks of MM training on attention and awareness, as measured by the MAAS (mindfulness attention awareness scale) and perceived stress, as measured by the PSQ (perceived stress questionnaire), in 80 volunteers from the general public recruited by email from university centers. An increase in the individual's dispositional capacity to be attentive and aware of the experience of the present moment in everyday life was observed in the experimental group versus the control group; F (2, 156) = 14.30, p = .000, eta 2 partial = .155. Perceived stress showed no significant differences between groups in: social acceptance; F (2, 156) = 2.30, p = .103, overload; F (2, 156) = 2.32, p = .101, irritability, tension and fatigue; F (2, 156) = 2.27, p = .106, energy and joy; F (2, 156) = 2.79, p = .065. MM practice for 8 weeks of training increases the individual's dispositional capacity to be attentive and aware of the experience of the present moment in everyday life but may not reduce perceived stress.",

Methods: Patients with a previous cancer diagnosis (n = 71) were recruited and randomized into an intervention group or a waiting-list control group. The intervention consisted of an 8-week MBSR training course. Results: There were no overall effects of the intervention on cortisol levels at 3-month or 6-month follow-up. However, a significant effect of moderation was found showing a different intervention effect on awakening cortisol among participants with varying baseline level of cortisol. Among those with initial low levels of cortisol, there was an increase from baseline to 3-month follow-up, and among those with initial high levels there was a decreased level of cortisol at 3-month follow-up. There was no association between changes in psychological outcomes and cortisol levels. Conclusions: The results suggest an adjustment of cortisol levels as a result of MBSR. The study gives preliminary support indicating that MBSR can influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis functioning. The importance of these findings for future research in the field of mindfulness and stress reduction among cancer patients are discussed. (Psychosomatics 2013; 54:158-164)",

            "abstract": "Advances have occurred in breast cancer survivorship but, for many African-American women, challenges and gaps in relevant information remain. This article identifies opportunities to address disparities in breast cancer survival and quality of life, and thereby to increase breast cancer survivorship among African-American women. For breast cancer survivors, common side effects, lasting for long periods after cancer treatment, include fatigue, loss of strength, difficulty sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. For addressing physical and mental health concerns, a variety of interventions have been evaluated, including exercise and weight training, dietary interventions, yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction, and support groups or group therapy. Obesity has been associated with breast cancer recurrence and poorer survival. Relative to white survivors, African-American breast cancer survivors are more likely to be obese and less likely to engage in physical activity, although exercise improves overall quality of life and cancer-related fatigue. Considerable information exists about the effectiveness of such interventions for alleviating distress and improving quality of life among breast cancer survivors, but few studies have focused specifically on African-American women with a breast cancer diagnosis. Studies have identified a number of personal factors that are associated with resilience, increased quality of life, and positive adaptation to a breast cancer diagnosis. There is a need for a better understanding of breast cancer survivorship among African-American women. Additional evaluations of interventions for improving the quality of life and survival of African-American breast cancer survivors are desirable.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The objective of this study was to identify risk and protective factors related to general prenatal distress and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress to inform intervention targets among women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study relied on data obtained from U.S. pregnant women (N = 701) who participated in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study from May 21 to October 3, 2020. The present cross-sectional study examined the potential risk and protective factors associated with different features of prenatal distress among U.S. pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Approximately two-thirds of expectant mothers indicated being more stressed about going to the hospital because of COVID-19. Generalized anxiety and PTSD were associated with higher levels of general and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress. Depression symptoms were associated with higher general prenatal distress. Higher levels of distress tolerance were associated with lower levels of general prenatal distress (B = - 0.192, p < .001) and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress (B = - 0.089, p < .05). Higher levels of instrumental social support were marginally associated with lower COVID-19-specific prenatal distress (B = - 0.140, p < 0.1). Conclusion Findings draw attention to prenatal distress experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including new types of distress arising from the pandemic itself. Women might benefit from the introduction of interventions such as mindfulness-based or relaxation therapy. Coverage of responsibilities and financial assistance is particularly needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations include a majority White and high socioeconomic sample. These findings provide specificity regarding potential targets for addressing prenatal distress.",

However, this psychological concept has only been rarely explored in observational studies, and no study to date has examined the association between dispositional mindfulness and weight status in a large population-based sample.ObjectiveWe aimed to examine the relationship between mindfulness scores and weight status in a large sample of the adult general population in France.Design and MethodsA total of 14,400 men and 49,228 women aged >= 18 y participating in the NutriNet-Sante study were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We collected mindfulness data using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire as well as self-reported weight and height. The association between weight status and dispositional mindfulness, as well as its subscales (observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reactivity), was assessed using multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors.ResultsWomen with higher dispositional mindfulness scores were less likely to be overweight (excluding obesity) (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90) and obese (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.78). In addition, overall, in this group, all subscales were inversely associated with weight status, with the strongest association found for the \"observing\" subscale. In men, higher mindfulness was associated only with lower odds of obesity (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.81 (0.69, 0.96)), and only the \"observing\" and \"non-reactivity\" subscales were significantly inversely associated with weight status.ConclusionResults support the interest of a shift in perspective that takes into account positive psychological and cognitive factors such as dispositional mindfulness in the investigation of obesity and its associated factors.",

            "abstract": "From its earliest days, Buddhism has been closely intertwined with the practice of medicine, both being concerned in their own way in the alleviation and prevention of human suffering. However, while the connection between Buddhism and healthcare has long been noted, there is scarce literature on how Buddhist philosophy can guide health-care practitioners in their professional as well as personal lives. In the sutras, we find analogies that describe the Buddha as a doctor, knowledge of Dharma as the treatment, and all lay people as patients. The occurrence of disease is closely related to one's mental, physical and spiritual health, society, culture, and environment. It is not enough to approach medicine in a manner that simply eradicates symptoms; the psychosocial aspects of disease and its mind based causes and remedies must be a primary consideration. Holistic care involves harmonization of all these elements, and the Buddhist philosophy offers great insight for the physician. The Buddhist medical literature lays out moral guidelines and ethics for a health-care practitioner and this has corollaries in the principles of medical ethics: nonmaleficence, benevolence, justice, and autonomy. There is emphasis on loving-kindness, compassion, empathy, and equanimity as key attributes of an ideal physician. The practice of medicine is a stressful profession with physician burnout an often neglected problem. Mindfulness meditation, as developed in Buddhism, can help health-care professionals cope up with the stress and develop the essential attributes to improve patient care and self-care. This article outlines the spiritual and ethical values which underlie Buddhist concern for the sick and gives an overview of lessons which health-care practitioners can imbibe from Buddhism.",

CFT recognizes the huge debt to Eastern psychologies such as Buddhism that have articulated the importance of compassion for our personal and social well-being for thousands of years. However CFT was originally developed for, and with, people who suffer from high levels of shame and self-criticism and who find experiences of support, kindness, and compassion-both from themselves and from others-difficult or even frightening.

Touch is one of the modalities through which we perceive bodily feelings. In this pilot study, self touch's role in enhancing interoceptive awareness was investigated. It was tested by means of a Self Body Brushing (SBB) procedure, which entails self-administered brushing of the entire body.Methods: A pre vs. post three-arm design was used, with 49 healthy adult participants. The SBB training was delivered to a first group (N = 13) and a Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) training to a second group (N = 15), considered as a reference intervention for promoting interoceptive awareness; a third group of inactive control participants (N = 14) was also included. Assessment included two self-report questionnaires: the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).Results: In several MAIA scales significant changes were observed: for Noticing, Attention regulation and Body listening, an overall improvement was observed, which was particularly due to changes in the active groups (SBB and MOM); Emotional awareness and Self-regulation scores increased more in the SBB group than in the other two groups. In the PSS measure, the changes in the active groups did not produce a statistically significant effect relative to the control group.Conclusions: SBB led to improvements in several aspects of self-reported interoceptive awareness at least as well as mindfulness meditation training. Further studies could investigate the potential effectiveness of SBB for promoting individual psychophysical health and well-being, in particular in the case of body image disturbances.",

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in how mindfulness meditation improves human health and well-being. Although studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can improve self-reported measures of disease symptomatology, the effect that mindfulness meditation has on biological mechanisms underlying human aging and disease is less clear. To address this issue, we conducted the first comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system parameters, with a specific focus on five outcomes: (1) circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular transcription factors and gene expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and (5) antibody response. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across studies with respect to patient population, study design, and assay procedures. The findings suggest possible effects of mindfulness meditation on specific markers of inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and biological aging, but these results are tentative and require further replication. On the basis of this analysis, we describe the limitations of existing work and suggest possible avenues for future research. Mindfulness meditation may be salutogenic for immune system dynamics, but additional work is needed to examine these effects.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are an increasingly popular way of attempting to improve the behavioural, cognitive and mental health outcomes of children and adolescents, though there is a suggestion that enthusiasm has moved ahead of the evidence base. Most evaluations of MBIs are either uncontrolled or nonrandomized trials. This meta-analysis aims to establish the efficacy of MBIs for children and adolescents in studies that have adopted a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design. METHODS: A systematic literature search of RCTs of MBIs was conducted up to October 2017. Thirty-three independent studies including 3,666 children and adolescents were included in random effects meta-analyses with outcome measures categorized into cognitive, behavioural and emotional factors. Separate random effects meta-analyses were completed for the seventeen studies (n = 1,762) that used an RCT design with an active control condition. RESULTS: Across all RCTs we found significant positive effects of MBIs, relative to controls, for the outcome categories of Mindfulness, Executive Functioning, Attention, Depression, Anxiety/Stress and Negative Behaviours, with small effect sizes (Cohen's d), ranging from .16 to .30. However, when considering only those RCTs with active control groups, significant benefits of an MBI were restricted to the outcomes of Mindfulness (d = .42), Depression (d = .47) and Anxiety/Stress (d = .18) only. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis reinforces the efficacy of using MBIs for improving the mental health and wellbeing of youth as assessed using the gold standard RCT methodology. Future RCT evaluations should incorporate scaled-up definitive trial designs to further evaluate the robustness of MBIs in youth, with an embedded focus on mechanisms of action.",

METHODS: A multicentre randomized and controlled clinical trial of parallel groups in patients with chronic low back pain between March 2019 to March 2020. Participants with no experience in mindfulness based intervention, were randomized to receive (36 patients) or not (34 patients) mindfulness-based stress reduction program for chronic back pain (MBSR-CBP). The program was performed in 9 sessions. Patients with chronic low back pain due to symptomatic discopathy (degenerative disc disease or herniated disc) were included. The principal outcome was changes in the blood level of cortisol and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)). Secondary outcomes (psychological factors, pain, and quality of life) were measured by validated questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 96 randomized patients, 70 who completed the study were included in the analysis (mean [range] age: 53 [33-73] years; 66% females). MBSR-CBP stopped the increase in cortisol, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta (p = 0.05). It reduced depression (p = 0.046) and stress (p = 0.0438), perceived pain (p &lt; 0.0001), and limitations related to health (p &lt; 0.0001).

Effect sizes were standardized mean differences calculated using the difference in pre-post change in the treatment group and control group means, divided by the pooled pre-intervention standard deviation. RESULTS: Significant between-group differences in change scores were found on self-report measures of compassion (d = 0.55, k = 4, 95% CI [0.33-0.78]), self-compassion (d = 0.70, k = 13, 95% CI [0.59-0.87]), mindfulness (d = 0.54, k = 6, 95% CI [0.38-0.71]), depression (d = 0.64, k = 9, 95% CI [0.45-0.82]), anxiety (d = 0.49, k = 9, 95% CI [0.30-0.68]), psychological distress (d = 0.47, k = 14, 95% CI [0.19-0.56]), and well-being (d = 0.51, k = 8, 95% CI [0.30-0.63]). These results remained when including active control comparisons. Evaluations of risk of bias across studies pointed towards a relative lack of publication bias and robustness of findings.

STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: Five databases were searched for randomised controlled trials that evaluate the indirect effects (IEs) of an MBP or mindfulness practice in relation to mental health and well-being outcomes through psychological mechanisms. FINDINGS: 27 eligible studies were identified, with only four exploring mechanisms in the context of specific mindfulness practices. Significant IEs were reported for mindfulness skills, decentering and attitudes of mindfulness (eg, self-compassion) across different outcomes, population samples, mental health strategies and active comparators. Evidence gap maps and requirements for testing and reporting IEs are provided to help guide future work. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness skills, decentering and attitudes of mindfulness may be key intervention targets for addressing the mental health of whole populations. However, future work needs to address significant knowledge gaps regarding the evidence for alternative mechanisms (eg, attention and awareness) in relation to unique outcomes (eg, well-being), mental health strategies (ie, promotion) and active comparators. High-quality trials, with powered multivariate mediation analyses that meet key requirements, will be needed to advance this area of work. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/NY2AH.",

While persons with dementia often have better outcomes when cared for at home, it can lead to personal challenges and self-neglect of the caregiver. Mindfulness-based interventions such as yoga can lessen the potential negative effects encountered by caregivers of persons with dementia. AIM: The aim of this review was to synthesise available empirical research related to the role of yoga on the biopsychosocial health outcomes for caregivers of persons with dementia population. METHOD: A systematic search of the databases Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus, Medline and PsychINFO was done using the terms \"yoga\" AND \"caregivers or family members or informal caregivers\" AND \"dementia or Alzheimer's.\" Using the selection process outlined by the PRISMA framework, thirty-six studies met the initial criteria and were potentially relevant to the topic. A methodological check was performed using the critical appraisal tool of Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt and the GRADE system of recommendation. This process led to the inclusion of four articles. FINDINGS: Four studies were included for this review: two randomised controlled trials, a non-randomised intervention study with a waitlist and a pilot cohort study. Three studies focused on informal caregivers and one study involved professional caregivers. In all studies, yoga practices included asanas, pranayama, relaxation and meditation. This integrative review recommended that yoga may be useful in reducing stress, depression and anxiety while increasing quality of life indicators, vitality indicators, self-compassion scores, mindfulness attention, sleep quality and diastolic blood pressure. Outcomes that were not significantly changed were caregiver burden, systolic blood pressure and heart rate. However, the level of evidence was moderate with small sample sizes suggesting additional research is needed to include well-designed randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of web-based compassion interventions on the mental well-being of family caregivers. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trials of web-based compassion intervention for family caregivers. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Proquest were searched from database inception until manuscript submission date. Eligible studies included family caregivers participating in web-based compassionate interventions with reported mental wellness indicators, such as self-compassion. Two independent researchers conducted a literature review, extracted data, and assessed the quality of each study using the risk of bias 2 tool. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to pool the data, followed by subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and Egger's tests. RESULTS: Of 1095 studies evaluated, 8 randomized controlled trials (encompassing 1978 participants) were included, with 75% exhibiting low risk of bias and high-quality evidence. Meta-analysis results indicated positive effects of web-based compassion interventions on family caregivers' self-compassion [standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.33; 95% CI, 0.08-0.58; P = .009] and mindfulness (SMD, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.03-0.90; P = .04). These interventions also demonstrated a positive impact on reducing stress (SMD, -0.32; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.04; P = .02) and anxiety (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.09; P = .003). Subgroup analyses highlighted superior self-compassion outcomes for caregivers supporting individuals with mental illness and cancer compared with those caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Interventions lasting \u22658 weeks were the most common and effective. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Web-based compassion interventions benefit family caregivers by enhancing self-compassion, mindfulness, and reducing anxiety and stress. More well-designed studies are suggested for future clinical applications.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) delivered via the Internet become increasingly popular for improving maternal mental health, but the effectiveness of internet-delivered MBIs (iMBIs) is still unclear. METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. We included studies that were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental study design, and pre-post test design and contained information on the population of interest (women during pregnancy or within one year after delivery), intervention contents (mindfulness components), and intervention delivery formats (internet-based). ROBINS-I and RoB 2 were used to rate the risk of bias in non-RCTs and RCTs, respectively. RESULTS: Eleven studies composed of six RCTs and five non-RCTs were included. The overall risk of bias was high. IMBIs are effective in improving maternal depression and mindfulness and self-compassion. However, limited by the small number of studies included in the review, effect sizes of iMBIs cannot be estimated. Characteristics of iMBIs (delivery formats, duration, et al.) and studies (study design, measures et al.) were described. CONCLUSION: iMBIs are still in the initial stage. Studies with rigorous study design and larger sample size, and determining the optimal delivery formats and duration and intensity of interventions are necessary.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Survivors of lung cancer and their partners often have complex unresolved physical, psychosocial, and behavioral needs that can negatively affect the survivors' and partners' well-being. This systematic review aimed to (1) examine the content and delivery of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and (2) summarize and synthesize the current evidence for effectiveness of MBIs targeting survivors of lung cancer and/or one selected partner (dyads). METHOD: Six databases were searched for interventional studies published in English between 1980 and June 2020 using three terms (lung neoplasms, mindfulness, caregivers). For outcome measures, the interventions focused on behavioral change (meditation, yoga, stretching, breathing), symptom management (dyspnea, fatigue, sleep disruption, anxiety, depression, stress reduction), and knowledge. Two reviewers independently assessed article eligibility. One reviewer performed and another independently verified data extraction. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials was used to critically appraise RCTs. RESULTS: Searching yielded 307 records, of which 64 were assessed for eligibility. Six studies investigated the impact of an MBI on survivors and partners. Four studies were single-arm feasibility studies; two were RCTs. Two feasibility studies and one RCT recruited romantic couples whereas the others recruited asymmetrical dyads. The single-arm studies reported strong feasibility and acceptability. RCTs reported significant outcomes for reduced cancer-related distress and depression, and improved QOL, self-compassion, mindfulness skills, and rumination. CONCLUSION: Dyadic intervention research is a growing field. Few interventions target individuals with lung cancer and their partners. No interventions target partners alone. Future research should evaluate rigorous methodologies that enhance the understanding of independent and interdependent health-related effects within dyads and across relationships and settings.",

            "title": "Mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention for elementary school teachers: a mixed method study.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, more than half of the teachers working in primary education experience high levels of work stress. Compared to other professions, teachers are more likely to drop out from work and develop mental illnesses. Almost one in five even choose a new profession within 5 years after starting as a teacher. This indicates an urgent need for interventions to reduce stress levels in teachers. However, few evidence-based effective interventions targeting stress and work-related problems in the primary educational system are available. AIM: In the current paper, we describe the protocol for a randomized controlled study (RCT) comparing an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with a wait list control condition in primary school teachers. We hypothesize that teachers who participate in the MBSR programme will report less stress (primary outcome) than those in the control group at post-test and at 3-month follow-up. We also expect a decrease in teachers' absenteeism and improvements of mental health, teacher skills, classroom climate quality and the pupil-teacher relationship (secondary outcomes). Finally, we hypothesize that self-compassion, mindfulness skills and emotion regulation skills could mediate effects. METHODS/DESIGN: A mixed-method study will be conducted among N=155 Dutch primary school teachers (grade 1 to 6). The quantitative study will be an RCT, in which teachers will be randomly allocated to the MBSR or waiting list control condition. Trial participants will not be made actively aware of their condition. The data analysts will be blinded. Online questionnaires will be sent to teachers before and after the MBSR programme, and at 3-month follow-up. Information about absenteeism will be collected. In the qualitative part of the study, we will interview teachers to examine their perceived effects of MBSR on their teaching skills, the classroom climate quality and the pupil-teacher relationship. DISCUSSION: This protocol paper describes a mixed-method study design with an RCT and a qualitative evaluation to evaluate an MBSR programme on perceived stress among primary school teachers. If the MBSR programme proves to be effective, it could be implemented as a programme to reduce stress and improve mental health and teaching outcomes in primary school teachers.

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The main objective of the study will be to evaluate the effects of two widely used standardized mindfulness-based programs [Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT)], on epigenetic, neurobiological, psychological, and physiological variables. METHODS: The programs will be offered in an intensive retreat format in a general population sample of healthy volunteer adults. During a 7-day retreat, participants will receive MBSR and CCT in a crossover design where participants complete both programs in random order. After finishing their first 3-day training with one of the two programs, participants will be assigned to the second 3-day training with the second program. The effects of the MBSR and CCT programs, and their combination, will be measured by epigenetic changes (i.e., DNA methylation biomarkers), neurobiological and psychophysiological measures (i.e., EEG resting state, EKG, respiration patterns, and diurnal cortisol slopes), self-report questionnaires belonging to different psychological domains (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, well-being, distress, and general functioning), and stress tasks (i.e., an Arithmetic Stress Test and the retrieval of negative autobiographical memories). These measures will be collected from both groups on the mornings of day 1 (pre-program), day 4 (after finishing the first program and before beginning the second program), and day 7 (post-second program). We will conduct a 3-month and a 12-month follow-up using only the set of self-report measures. DISCUSSION: This study aims to shed light on the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms linked to meditation and compassion in the general population. The protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05516355; August 23, 2022).",

The effects of mindfulness interventions on prenatal maternal well-being are increasingly examined but outcomes have yet to be systematically evaluated. The aims of the current paper are to systematically evaluate intervention effects and current research approaches with pregnant groups. DESIGN: A systematic review of eight studies examining mindfulness intervention effects on prenatal well-being. RESULTS: Findings indicate potential benefits of mindfulness interventions for reducing levels of depression, anxiety and negative affect during pregnancy. There is also evidence for improved self-compassion and perceived childbirth self-efficacy. Further, these effects may be more pronounced for vulnerable groups, such as women currently experiencing low prenatal well-being. Less consistent findings were observed for stress, and positive affect. Variations in research design, gestational characteristics, timing of assessments and outcome measurement may explain some inconsistencies in the extant literature. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness interventions present a potentially useful means to improve prenatal well-being but improved methodological quality is essential to rigorously examine intervention effects.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Individuals diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) seek pleasurable foods to avoid their negative emotional experiences. Ineffective regulation of negative emotions may be a risk factor for emotional eating (EE), leading to suffering, dysfunctional behaviors, and weight gain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between emotional dysregulation and EE, investigating potential mediators such as the intensity of the worry, avoidance of internal experiences, mindfulness, and self-compassion in female patients with anxiety. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants from a randomized clinical trial diagnosed with GAD answered the following instruments at baseline: the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Action and Acceptance Questionnaire (AAQ), the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). We estimated Pearson correlation coefficients and performed mediation analyses. RESULTS: We evaluated 51 female individuals, 34 of whom completed all the questionnaires. Our data showed that EE was positively correlated with emotional dysregulation (r = 0.593; p < 0.001), worry trait (r = 0.402; p = 0.018), and avoidance of internal experiences (r = 0.565; p < 0.001), whereas it was negatively correlated with self-compassion (r = -0.590; p < 0.001) and mindful state (r = -0.383; p = 0.026). Moreover, we demonstrated that self-compassion mediates the relationship between emotional dysregulation and EE (ab product estimate = 0.043, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.003-0.084). CONCLUSION: Our findings contribute to the literature by identifying psychological factors that could mediate the association between emotional dysregulation and EE, enabling identification of more effective eating behavior intervention targets for patients with GAD.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged as secular practices, including elements of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). While MBIs have been widely adopted for physical and mental illness, only a few available programs are explicitly adapted for psychosis. However, previous reviews have reported the vital heterogeneity regarding treatment program structure. Therefore, this review aims to compare the structure of different mindfulness protocols applied to patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted up to March 2023 in PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo. Following our protocol (CRD 42023253356), we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. RESULTS: We included 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1500 patients SSD. All programs varied in structure, session components, duration, and instructor experience. While MBSR-like programs focused on stress reactivity, MBCT-like programs addressed primary symptoms of psychosis and relapse prevention. Despite the heterogeneity of programs, some common mechanisms emerged, including attention training, emotion and stress regulation, decentering, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring. CONCLUSIONS: The critical heterogeneity found limits the interpretation of results. However, most recent trials present fewer risks of bias and more homogenous programs. Findings suggested potential benefits, such as reduced negative symptoms, increased well-being, and decreased hospitalization rates. For future studies, authors should align on more congruent MBIs programs for patients with SSD. Further research is needed to identify optimal mindfulness teaching approaches for patients with psychosis and investigate specific mechanisms of action, relevant processes, and optimal doses in varying settings.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based mobile apps have become popular tools for enhancing well-being in today's fast-paced world. Their ability to reduce geographical, financial, and social barriers makes them a promising alternative to traditional interventions. OBJECTIVE: As most available apps lack a theoretical framework, this review aimed to evaluate their effectiveness and assess their quality. We expected to find small sample sizes, high dropout rates, and small effect sizes in the included studies. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using PsycInfo, PsycNet, PubMed, an institutional search engine (u:search), and Google Scholar. Randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of mobile mindfulness apps on well-being in nonclinical samples were included. Study selection, risk of bias (using the version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials), and reporting quality (using selected CONSORT [Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials] statement criteria) assessments were performed by 2 authors independently and discussed until a consensus was reached. RESULTS: The 28 included randomized controlled trials differed in well-being measures, apps, and intervention duration (7 to 56 days; median duration 28 days). A wide range of sample sizes (12 to 2282; median 161) and attrition rates (0% to 84.7%; median rate 23.4%) were observed. Most studies (19/28, 68%) reported positive effects on at least one aspect of well-being. The effects were presented using different metrics but were primarily small or small to medium in size. Overall risk of bias was mostly high. CONCLUSIONS: The wide range of sample sizes, attrition rates, and intervention periods and the variation in well-being measures and mobile apps contributed to the limited comparability of the studies. Although most studies (16/28, 57%) reported small or small to medium effects for at least one well-being outcome, this review demonstrates that the generalizability of the results is limited. Further research is needed to obtain more consistent conclusions regarding the impact of mindfulness-based mobile apps on well-being in nonclinical populations.",

Current treatment options for PTSD are unappealing as they either require re-exposure to the traumatic event or medications that are greatly impacted by comorbidities. Meditation-based interventions are a promising alternative. However, there is a dearth of research examining their impact. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine meditation-based interventions tested for efficacy in treating PTSD among veterans and provide collective evidence. METHODS: Authors searched the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases for relevant studies using the following inclusion criteria: (1) published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) conducted between January 2014 and July 2020; (3) described the evaluation of interventions; and (4) incorporated quantitative or mixed methods. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: U.S. Veterans. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (ten articles) met the inclusion criteria. Four tested Transcendental Meditation (n = 4), three tested Mantra Meditation (n = 3), two tested Mindful Meditation (n = 2), one tested Breathing-based Meditation (n = 1), one tested Mindfulness-based Exposure Therapy (n = 1), one tested Cognitively-based Compassion Training Meditation (n = 1), one tested Mantra Meditation and Mindfulness-based Treatment (n = 1), one tested Mindfulness-based PTSD Treatment (n = 1), and one tested Primary Care Brief Mindfulness Program (n = 1). The most common duration was 8 weeks (n = 8) and the most common evaluation design was the randomized controlled trial (n = 10). The most common outcome measure was the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (n = 12). CONCLUSION: All interventions reported improvements in PTSD symptoms. Based on this review, meditation-based therapy is a promising approach for managing PTSD, particularly among veterans resistant to trauma-focused therapies. Randomized control trials with large sample sizes that apply CAPS as their primary outcome measure, and take into account effect size, attrition rates, and blinding are recommended for further research.",

There are many promising face-to-face group format interventions focusing on self-compassion. We investigated the feasibility of an online self-compassion program. DESIGN: A feasibility and proof-of-concept study of an online adapted Mindfulness-based Compassionate Living (MBCL) program. PARTICIPANTS: Self-referred participants suffering from harsh self-criticism (N = 39) were offered an online program and were asked to complete outcome measures at baseline, after 8 weeks (post-intervention) and after 14 weeks (follow-up). INTERVENTION: The online program consisted of seven sessions, including a first session introducing mindfulness and mindfulness meditation followed by a six-session adaptation of the MBCL program. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were the Forms of Self-criticizing/Attacking and Self-reassuring Scale (FSCRS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experience (CHIME), the Fear of Self-compassion (FSC), and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). Additionally, we assessed satisfaction with the program and negative effects related to the program. Furthermore, we used several measures of program usage (number of processed modules, number of logins, time spent in the program, number of diary entries, number of entries in completed exercises). RESULTS: Self-compassion, mindfulness, reassuring-self and satisfaction with life significantly increased whereas inadequate self, hated self, perceived stress and fear of self-compassion significantly decreased from pre- to the 8-week assessment. Results remained stable from post- to the 6-week follow-up. Pre-to-post within-effect sizes were medium to large (ds = 0.50-1.50) and comparable to those found within a face-to-face group format in a similar sample. Time spent in the program significantly predicted self-compassion at post. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study are promising. However, they must be seen as preliminary since replication in a randomized controlled trial, with clinical measures/diagnoses and a longer follow-up period, is necessary.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated common and dissociable neural and psychological correlates of two widely used meditation-based stress reduction programs. METHODS: Participants were randomized to the Relaxation Response (RR; n = 18; 56% female) or the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; n = 16; 56% female) programs. Both programs use a \"bodyscan\" meditation; however, the RR program explicitly emphasizes physical relaxation during this practice, whereas the MBSR program emphasizes mindful awareness with no explicit relaxation instructions. After the programs, neural activity during the respective meditation was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Both programs were associated with reduced stress (for RR, from 14.1 \u00b1 6.6 to 11.3 \u00b1 5.5 [Cohen's d = 0.50; for MBSR, from 17.7 \u00b1 5.7 to 11.9 \u00b1 5.0 [Cohen's d = 1.02]). Conjunction analyses revealed functional coupling between ventromedial prefrontal regions and supplementary motor areas (p < .001). The disjunction analysis indicated that the RR bodyscan was associated with stronger functional connectivity of the right inferior frontal gyrus-an important hub of intentional inhibition and control-with supplementary motor areas (p < .001, family-wise error [FWE] rate corrected). The MBSR program was uniquely associated with improvements in self-compassion and rumination, and the within-group analysis of MBSR bodyscan revealed significant functional connectivity of the right anterior insula-an important hub of sensory awareness and salience-with pregenual anterior cingulate during bodyscan meditation compared with rest (p = .03, FWE corrected). CONCLUSIONS: The bodyscan exercises in each program were associated with both overlapping and differential functional coupling patterns, which were consistent with each program's theoretical foundation. These results may have implications for the differential effects of these programs for the treatment of diverse conditions.",

Although hormone therapy is commonly used to alleviate menopausal symptoms, it carries a potential risk of cancer. Recently, mind-body exercises have emerged as innovative approaches for improving menopausal symptoms and bone health. However, research findings have needed to be more consistent, highlighting the significance of this study's systematic review of mind-body exercise effects on perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of mind-body exercises, including tai chi, yoga, Pilates, qigong, baduanjin, and mindfulness-based stress reduction, on bone mineral density, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and fatigue among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Four electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science-were systematically searched from inception until July 2023. The search focused exclusively on randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of mind-body exercise interventions on perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Bias Risk Assessment tool. FINDINGS: A total of 11 randomized controlled trials, comprising 1,005 participants, were included in the analysis. Traditional meta-analysis indicated that mind-body exercise significantly enhanced bone mineral density in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women compared with control groups, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.66; P = 0.001, I2 = 7%). In addition, significant improvements were observed in sleep quality (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.17; P = 0.002, I2 = 76%), anxiety reduction (SMD, -0.80; 95% CI, -1.23 to -0.38; P = 0.0002, I2 = 84%), depressive mood (SMD, -0.80; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.44; P < 0.0001, I2 = 79%), and fatigue (SMD, -0.67; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.37; P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%).

DESIGN: A qualitative study embedded within a multicentre, single blind, randomised controlled trial (the PREVENT trial). SETTING: Primary care urban and rural settings in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 42 people who participated in the MBCT arm of the parent trial were purposively sampled to represent a range of recovery journeys. INTERVENTIONS: MBCT involves eight weekly group sessions, with four refresher sessions offered in the year following the end of the programme. It was adapted to offer bespoke support around ADM tapering and discontinuation. METHODS: Written feedback and structured in-depth interviews were collected in the 2 years after participants undertook MBCT. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and case studies constructed to illustrate the findings. RESULTS: People with recurrent depression have unique recovery journeys that shape and are shaped by their pharmacological and psychological treatment choices. Their journeys typically include several over-arching themes: (1) beliefs about the causes of depression, both biological and psychosocial; (2) personal agency, including expectations about their role in recovery and treatment; (3) acceptance, both of depression itself and the recovery journey; (4) quality of life; (5) experiences and perspectives on ADM and ADM tapering-discontinuation; and (6) the role of general practitioners, both positive and negative. CONCLUSIONS: People with recurrent depression describe unique, complex recovery journeys shaped by their experiences of depression, treatment and interactions with health professionals. Understanding how several themes coalesce for each individual can both support their recovery and treatment choices as well as health professionals in providing more accessible, collaborative, individualised and empowering care.

Group, blended eMBCT offers peer support and guidance, whereas individual, unguided eMBCT offers flexibility and the possibility of large-scale implementation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this nonrandomized feasibility study was to assess aspects of feasibility of the group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT interventions. METHODS: Participants were people with cancer who chose between group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT. Both intervention conditions followed the same 8-week eMBCT program, including an introductory session and a silent day (10 sessions total). All sessions for individual, unguided eMBCT occurred via the platform Minddistrict, whereas group, blended eMBCT consisted of 3 online videoconference sessions guided by a mindfulness teacher and 5 sessions via Minddistrict. We assessed the feasibility of the intervention quantitatively and qualitatively by evaluating its acceptability among participants. Additionally, we assessed limited efficacy by looking at the number of questionnaires participants completed pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: We included 12 participants for each eMBCT condition. Participants in group, blended eMBCT completed, on average, 9.7 of 10 sessions, compared with an average 8.3 sessions for individual, unguided eMBCT (excluding dropouts). Of the 24 participants, 13 (54%) agreed to be interviewed (5 unguided and 8 blended). Participants in both conditions reported positive experiences, including the convenience of not having to travel and the flexibility to choose when and where to participate. However, among the barriers for participation, participants in the group, blended condition reported a preference for more group sessions, and participants in the individual, unguided condition reported a lack of guidance. Additionally, for the group, blended condition, the effect sizes were small for all outcome measures (Hedges g range=0.01-0.36), except for fatigue, which had a moderate effect size (Hedges g=0.57). For the individual, unguided condition, the effect sizes were small for all outcome measures (Hedges g range=0.24-0.46), except for mindfulness skills (Hedges g=0.52) and engagement with the intervention (Hedges g=1.53). CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this study had a positive experience with group, blended and individual, unguided eMBCT. Based on the results from this study, we will adjust the intervention prior to conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness; we will add 1 group session to the group, blended eMBCT using Zoom as the platform for the group sessions; and we will send reminders to participants to complete questionnaires.

            "abstract": "Meditation training can improve mood and emotion regulation, yet the neural mechanisms of these affective changes have yet to be fully elucidated. We evaluated the impact of long- and short-term mindfulness meditation training on the amygdala response to emotional pictures in a healthy, non-clinical population of adults using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Long-term meditators (N = 30, 16 female) had 9081 h of lifetime practice on average, primarily in mindfulness meditation. Short-term training consisted of an 8-week Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction course (N = 32, 22 female), which was compared to an active control condition (N = 35, 19 female) in a randomized controlled trial. Meditation training was associated with less amygdala reactivity to positive pictures relative to controls, but there were no group differences in response to negative pictures. Reductions in reactivity to negative stimuli may require more practice experience or concentrated practice, as hours of retreat practice in long-term meditators was associated with lower amygdala reactivity to negative pictures - yet we did not see this relationship for practice time with MBSR. Short-term training, compared to the control intervention, also led to increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and a region implicated in emotion regulation - ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) - during affective pictures. Thus, meditation training may improve affective responding through reduced amygdala reactivity, and heightened amygdala-VMPFC connectivity during affective stimuli may reflect a potential mechanism by which MBSR exerts salutary effects on emotion regulation ability.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most research on the impact of mind-body training does not ask about participants' baseline experience, expectations, or preferences for training. To better plan participant-centered mind-body intervention trials for nurses to reduce occupational stress, such descriptive information would be valuable. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous email survey between April and June, 2010 of North American nurses interested in mind-body training to reduce stress. The e-survey included: demographic characteristics, health conditions and stress levels; experiences with mind-body practices; expected health benefits; training preferences; and willingness to participate in future randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Of the 342 respondents, 96% were women and 92% were Caucasian. Most (73%) reported one or more health conditions, notably anxiety (49%); back pain (41%); GI problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (34%); or depression (33%). Their median occupational stress level was 4 (0 = none; 5 = extreme stress). Nearly all (99%) reported already using one or more mind-body practices to reduce stress: intercessory prayer (86%), breath-focused meditation (49%), healing or therapeutic touch (39%), yoga/tai chi/qi gong (34%), or mindfulness-based meditation (18%). The greatest expected benefits were for greater spiritual well-being (56%); serenity, calm, or inner peace (54%); better mood (51%); more compassion (50%); or better sleep (42%). Most (65%) wanted additional training; convenience (74% essential or very important), was more important than the program's reputation (49%) or scientific evidence about effectiveness (32%) in program selection. Most (65%) were willing to participate in a randomized trial of mind-body training; among these, most were willing to collect salivary cortisol (60%), or serum biomarkers (53%) to assess the impact of training. CONCLUSIONS: Most nurses interested in mind-body training already engage in such practices. They have greater expectations about spiritual and emotional than physical benefits, but are willing to participate in studies and to collect biomarker data. Recruitment may depend more on convenience than a program's scientific basis or reputation. Knowledge of participants' baseline experiences, expectations, and preferences helps inform future training and research on mind-body approaches to reduce stress.",

            "title": "Stay Present with Your Phone: A Systematic Review and Standardized Rating of Mindfulness Apps in European App Stores.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions show positive effects on physical and mental health. For a better integration of mindfulness techniques in daily life, the use of apps may be promising. However, only a few studies have examined the quality of mindfulness apps using a validated standardized instrument. This review aims to evaluate the content, quality, and privacy features of mindfulness-focused apps from European commercial app stores. METHODS: An automated search engine (webcrawler) was used to identify mindfulness-focused apps in the European Apple App- and Google Play store. Content, quality, and privacy features were evaluated by two independent reviewers using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). The MARS assesses the subscales engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. RESULTS: Out of 605 identified apps, 192 met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality was moderate (M = 3.66, SD = 0.48). Seven apps were tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Most of the apps showed a lack of data security and no privacy policy. The five apps with the highest ratings are from a credible source, include a privacy policy, and are also based on standardized mindfulness and behavior change techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The plethora of often low-quality apps in commercial app stores makes it difficult for users to identify a suitable app. Above that, the lack of scientific verification of effectiveness and shortcomings in privacy protection and security poses potential risks. So far, the potential of mindfulness-focused apps is not exploited in commercial app stores.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The study examined the effects of a telephone-administered psycho-education with behavioral activation intervention (TBA) for family caregivers of person's with Alzheimer's dementia to reduce levels of depressive symptoms and burden and to enhance relationship satisfaction with the care-recipient METHODS: A double-blinded randomized trial compared TBA with telephone-based psycho-education with general monitoring (TGM). Ninety-six dementia caregivers were randomized. Both conditions received four weekly psycho-education sessions led by a social worker. TBA participants then received eight bi-weekly behavioral activation practice sessions delivered by paraprofessionals. TGM participants received eight bi-weekly monitoring sessions by paraprofessionals. RESULTS: As compared to TGM, TBA participants reported significantly larger reductions in depressive symptoms and burden and larger improvement in relationship satisfaction. Self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts was found to have a partial meditation effect between TBA and the reduction of depressive symptoms. Qualitative feedback suggested that TBA participants expressed unique gains in awareness and developing new ways of reappraising the caregiving situation. CONCLUSION: TBA was an effective intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and burden as well as to enhance relationship satisfaction in dementia caregivers. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The use of telephone and trained paraprofessionals can enhance the accessibility and sustainability of behavioral activation intervention for dementia family caregivers.",

            "abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are growing in popularity, with research concerning their efficacy with youth populations. Following a preliminary analysis of the existing literature, and given the positive effects of such programs, we felt it relevant to assess whether research has considered the implications for MBIs on children and adolescents, with regard to depression, anxiety, and school climate. OBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the effect of MBIs as innovative interventions addressing youths in school settings, with special consideration for anxiety, depression, and school climate outcomes. METHOD: This review investigates the existing literature in the field of mindfulness, using quasi-experimental and randomized control trial (RCT) models, targeted at youth (5-18 years) in school settings. A search was carried out in four databases-WebofScience, Google Scholar, PubMed, and PsycARTICLES. This resulted in 39 articles, which were sorted based on predetermined inclusion criteria; 12 articles qualified. RESULTS: The results show discrepancies in terms of methodological and implementation variables, types of interventions, instructor trainings, assessment measures, and choice of practices and exercises, which make the effects of existing school MBIs difficult to compare. Consistencies were observed in emotional and behavioral regulation, prosocial behaviors, and reducing stress and anxiety in students. The results of this systematic review also suggest that MBIs could be potential mediators in improving student well-being and environmental factors, such as school and class climates. Specifically, children's sense of safety and community can be improved by an improved quality of relationships between students, their peers, and teachers. Future research should consider incorporating school climate perspectives, such as implementing whole-school MBI approaches and using replicable and comparable study designs and methods, whilst considering the capacities and limitations of the academic and institutional context.",
