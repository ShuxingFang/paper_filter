            "abstract": "Self-compassion is conceptualized as containing 3 core components: self-kindness versus self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus overidentification, when relating to painful experiences. Research evidence demonstrates that self-compassion is related to psychological flourishing and reduced psychopathology. Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) is an 8-week training program, meeting 2.5 hours each week, designed to help participants cultivate self-compassion. MSC contains a variety of meditations (e.g., loving-kindness, affectionate breathing) as well as informal practices for use in daily life (e.g., soothing touch, self-compassionate letter writing). A detailed clinical case illustrates the journey of a client through the 8 weeks of MSC training, describing the key features of each session and the client's response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "title": "Mystical Love: The Universal Solvent.",
            "abstract": "The authors, both anthropologists who study alternative states of consciousness (ASC), explore the psychodynamics of mystical experience (ME). An affect that is a key factor for and integral to the phenomenology of ME is what they term \"mystical love.\" In many respects, ME refers to ASC that is diametrically opposite to everyday ego-centered, materialist consciousness. In this article we examine several questions, including: (1) Why do humans experience ME, (2) why does there seems to be a need to alter consciousness away from ordinary waking states, (3) what is the relationship between mystical love and other affective states such as anger, greed, and anxiety, and (3) what are the necessary conditions for ME-type, transpersonal experiences? We demonstrate that ritual practices are recurrently used across cultures to incubate and evoke intense feelings of non-romantic love, empathy, and compassion. Some of these practices include ritual drivers such as ingesting psychotropic substances (entheogens and empathogens), daily activities that devalue ego centeredness and promote love, empathy and selfless service, meditation upon loving kindness, and compassion. All of these practices are preparations for entering ME, the results of which are interpreted within people's cycle of meaning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "title": "Teaching Mindfulness to Create Effective Counselors.",
            "abstract": "Over the last decade a number of researchers have proposed that therapeutic presence can be fostered through training in mindfulness practices. Most counseling training programs focus on teaching students a set of skills, although the common or contextual factors movement contends that the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the personal characteristics of the therapist are the key determinants of positive therapy outcomes. For the past 10 years we have been teaching mindfulness practices to counseling students in a CACREP-accredited program. Our research suggests that training in practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga, qigong, and body-awareness can help counselors to realize and embody the personal characteristics that foster therapeutic presence. This article provides a detailed description of our mindfulness-based course, proposes recommendations for counseling coursework in mindfulness, and discusses the impact of the course on the ability to cultivate therapeutic presence.

            "abstract": "Objectives: This pilot study explores the impact of Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) in veterans. Self-compassion, the capacity to hold one's suffering with kindness and a wish to alleviate it, is associated with improvements in well-being. Veterans have more medical conditions than non-veterans and higher prevalence rates of severe pain. Acceptability of the intervention with veterans is assessed along with the impact of MSC on the physical, mental, and social health of the participants. Methods: A racially diverse, predominantly male group of veterans (n = 80) were assessed pre- and post-MSC group with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) to evaluate physical, mental, and social health. Measures of self-compassion, happiness, self-report medication usage, and a global assessment of improvement measure were also included. Qualitative responses to the MSC program were also solicited and reviewed. Results: Engagement with MSC was high (74% completion rate) and 96% of treatment completers rated their participation in the intervention as positive. Completers demonstrated small to medium effect size increases in self-compassion, happiness, and social role satisfaction, 95% CIs (- 6.13, -2.65), (-2.62, -1.06), and (-4.28, -1.05), and decreases in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain interference, 95% CIs (0.44, 4.13), (0.57, 4.84), (0.43, 3.71), and (0.13, 2.70). In exploratory analyses related to pain, veterans taking pain medication reported a significant decrease in use (\u03c72(2, N = 47) = 24.30, p < .001). Conclusions: These results are suggestive of the positive effects of the MSC intervention to veterans, but await a randomized controlled trial to establish its effectiveness in this population.

            "abstract": "We explore the role of meditative practice in cultivating experiences of compassion, empathy, and altruism and address an apparent paradox: Meditation often is associated with solitary retreat, if not preoccupation with one's own concerns. How, then, does such a practice promote compassion for others? We propose a two-stage model. The first stage involves disengagement from usual preoccupation with self-reinforcing, self-defeating, or self-indulgent behaviors and reactions; the second involves a focused engagement with a universal human capacity for altruistic experience, love, and compassion. Reference is made to the limited research literature and to clinical applications of loving kindness (metta) meditation in cultivating these processes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

            "abstract": "Objectives: Accumulating evidence from the last two decades suggests self-compassion is central to psychological well-being and reduced psychopathology symptoms. Loving-kindness meditations (LKMs), a mindfulness practice that involves sending feelings of kindness to oneself, loved ones, and all beings, may increase feelings of self-compassion. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of LKMs on self-compassion in adults. Methods: Peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertations written in English with adult samples, quantitative analysis of a LKM, and measured self-compassion using the Self-Compassion Scale were included in the meta-analysis. Seven articles met inclusion criteria following a systematic search. Results: We found a moderate overall effect of LKMs on self-compassion (g = 0.44, p < 0.0001), indicating LKMs are effective at increasing self-compassion in adults. Conclusions: Self-compassion can be increased in adults using LKMs. Given the role of self-compassion in well-being, future research should test increasing self-compassion as a mechanism of the effect of LKMs on psychological health.

            "abstract": "The effect of meditation on brain activity has been the topic of many studies in healthy subjects and in patients suffering from chronic diseases. These effects are either explored during meditation practice (state effects) or as a longer-term result of meditation training during the resting-state (trait). The topic of this article is to first review these findings by focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) changes in healthy subjects with or without experience in meditation. Modifications in EEG baseline rhythms, functional connectivity and advanced nonlinear parameters are discussed in regard to feasibility in clinical applications. Secondly, we provide a state-of-the-art of studies that proposed meditative practices as a complementary therapy in patients with epilepsy, in whom anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent. In these studies, the effects of standardized meditation programs including elements of traditional meditation practices such as mindfulness, loving-kindness and compassion are explored both at the level of psychological functioning and on the occurrence of seizures. Lastly, preliminary results are given regarding our ongoing study, the aim of which is to quantify the effects of a mindfulness self-compassion (MSC) practice on interictal and ictal epileptic activity. Feasibility, difficulties, and prospects of this study are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "title": "The two arrows of pain: Mechanisms of pain related to meditation and mental states of aversion and identification",
            "abstract": "Objectives: According to the core Buddhist psychology models of the 'two arrows of pain' and 'co-dependent origination,' pain is the resultant of bodily and mental factors, which can be regulated by meditation states and traits. Here we investigated how pain and the related aversion and identification (self-involvement) experiences are modulated by focused attention meditation (FAM), open monitoring meditation (OMM), and loving kindness meditation (LKM), as well as by meditation expertise. Methods: Theravada Buddhist long-term meditators were matched with a group of short-term meditators. Nociceptive electrical stimulation was administered during FAM, OMM, and LKM, and in a non-meditative rest condition. Experience reports of pain, aversion, and identification were collected in each trial. Results: Pain thresholds were higher in long-term meditators than in short-term meditators. In the short-term meditators, as compared to rest, pain was reduced in FAM and OMM, and aversion and identification in all meditation conditions. In the long-term meditators, pain was reduced only in LKM. Identification was reduced in the three forms of meditation, while aversion was not affected by meditation. Further analyses with a particular focus on long-term meditators showed that pain was predicted to increase with meditation expertise, aversion, and identification. Granger causality analysis revealed that aversion and pain, as well as aversion and identification, causally influenced each other; identification causally influenced pain. This pattern of results about the relationships between pain, aversion, and identification was largely overlapping in the group of short-term meditators. Conclusions: The findings reveal mechanisms of pain in interaction with aversive and identification mental states, as well as their modulation by meditation states and traits. They also suggest that pain feeling is the resultant of coupling of sensory and mental factors, thus highlighting the relevance of the second arrow of pain and providing a clarification of the epistemological gap between sensory causation and mental state causation of pain, in terms of a co-production mechanism with multiple stages. In particular, the evidence about the causal influences of identification on pain highlights a self-related factor of relevance in pain experiences that can be modulated by mindfulness. The study also inspires new testable neuroscientific hypotheses, and sheds new light on core Buddhist psychology models, based on evidence from a controlled experimental setting and experience dimension reports by long-term meditators with enhanced mindfulness skills.

            "abstract": "Objectives Reducing and eliminating the use of Restrictive Practices (RPs) is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). This systematic review examines the effectiveness of organisation-wide interventions in reducing behaviours of concern (BoC) and the use of RPs in people with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Methods 19 electronic databases were searched up to February 2021 for literature, with no language restrictions applied. This systematic review of interventions included any publication aimed at reducing the use of RPs and/or BoC in organisations providing services to people with any NDD. Results A total of 15 studies were included in the review. Seven were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-RCTs. Most studies focussed on workplace education and training. There was evidence that staff training in Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) and mindfulness-based PBS (MBPBS) reduced aggression, the use of chemical and physical restraints, and peer and staff injuries (MBPBS) in the medium term. A multi-component intervention also showed evidence of a reduction in behaviours of concern in the medium and long term. Conclusions A number of studies showed that organisation-wide PBS training, particularly MBPBS training, can reduce BoC and the use of RPs. One multi-component study also substantially reduced BoC. Organisational strategies such as these can improve the rights of people with disability by reducing the use of RPs. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited as all comparisons were single studies which had potential biases. We are also not able to say whether these findings can be generalised to children, and adults with other neurodevelopmental disabilities, as all but one study focused on adults with intellectual disabilities.
